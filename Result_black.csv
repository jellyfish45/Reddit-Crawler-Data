But, first, I think of Youkrane.  Evil country is invading Youkrane because Youkrane good country that is anti-racism and pro-diversity and pro-human-right.   I depressed because of the suffering of Youkrane.  I ask President of America: please don't stop until Youkrane remove evil invader and make all of Youkrane completely free again.  I will try to stay alive if President don't quit removing evil invader from Youkrane.  I think American President should declare Martial Law and temporarily halt all elections until Youkrane is free and evil invaders are defeated. If evil invaders of Youkrane win, then the Earth will be completely defeated, and then nothing left.  Must win at all cost.

Okay, so I live in America.  And here, so much racism.  why we have border?  all human is human, right?  so, border exist to oppress people.  why not any human allow to come?  why only one people in country have all the money and power?  why minority people so oppressed and not equally represented in all careers and socio-economic status?  this all make me depressed and suicidal.  all human equal from birth, so all human on earth are automatically citizen of America.  8 billion people on earth, and all are citizens, cause all are equal.  if i have to live in a America that is so racist, then, I can't take the depression and anxiety any more, and I will end my life.

Many users have argued that facts cannot be racist, which is true. However, much of what is purported to be factual is actually twisted by inherent racism. For example, the assertion that black people commit more violent crime than white people is false: In fact, black people are arrested/convicted for violent crime more often than white people. The statistic does not represent a fact-based commentary on a racial proclivity; it represents a way in which systemic racism has unfairly maligned a historically marginalized portion of the population.

Furthermore, even objective facts can be presented in a manner that promotes (or is promoted by) a racist agenda. It may be factual to state that a given entertainer is Jewish, for instance, but if that point is being raised as a means of insinuating something anti-Semitic, it is nonetheless an example of bigotry. Statements of this sort are referred to as ""dog-whistles;"" as coded phrases that are ostensibly based in fact, but which are being presented with bad-faith intentions.

Dog-whistles, implied bigotry, and memetic phrases with bigoted subtexts are all forbidden in /r/ThereWasAnAttempt. Please note that there's a different between attacking a disparaged group who cannot change how they were born, and attacking memberships of groups (e.g. saying ""ACAB"" is not bigotry. Cops can quit, black people can't stop being black).

Civil criticism of religion, governments, and groups/organizations are fully permitted. Veiled attacks that are instead meant to target and attack a nation/race of people that practice these faiths, is forbidden.

If you don't understand some of the reasons behind these additions, that's ok. Many people are at different points on their path to education, and everyone should treat it as a process vice a destination. We encourage users to head over to r/socialjustice101 to either ask about specific points or to explain them to other users if you do understand. We won't be debating these here or in modmail as that's not a debate forum.

9,,Black Girls/Youth and Suicide Rates,23,umyv1c,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/umyv1c/black_girlsyouth_and_suicide_rates/,2,"Recently, Preston Igwe, MD discussed on a Twitter thread about the mental health of Black youth.—in particular how suicide rates have been increasing.  Unfortunately, there are some negative things—which isn't surprising due to the factors that Black folks experience already, adding on teen experiences, and just the pandemic. 

Here are some key things that stuck out to me:

1. Suicide rates for Black girls have increased by more than double that for Black boys. 
2. For older adolescents (15-17), the most common precipitating factor for a suicide attempt is relationship problems. For younger adolescents, it’s family problems.
3. About half of Black adolescents who attempted suicide never met criteria for a psychiatric condition by current screening tools. This indicates that our instruments may not be adequate for screening Black youth suicide risk.
4. Some protective factors against suicide for Black youth: familial support, school connectedness, high level of racial/ethnic identification, stable finances.

&#x200B;

Here is the link to his thread: [https://twitter.com/PrestonIgweMD/status/1524107085079744512](https://twitter.com/PrestonIgweMD/status/1524107085079744512)

&#x200B;

I feel like this exposes a lot of things. From religion to gender roles to just how psychology and psychiatry really need to revamp themselves, and not only have such a model that is solely clinical that has only used participants that are cishet white men. I think this data can really make the wave for more research for Black adolescents, but also allow for us to change our thinking and the way we view the pressures of expecting black children, especially black girls to be strong all of the time and how it brings harm. It's interesting to me as someone who is a Black woman who is an atheist how religion or anything related to spirituality was not mentioned in protective factors especially with how much Christianity and other Afro religions have influenced our experiences.

As most know, **Freeda Foreman**, the daughter of famous boxer and the man behind the famous ""Foreman Grills"" George Foreman, passed away by way of suicide at 42. I found this to be extremely disheartening. I think as Black women, we need to have more conversations not only on depression, but also on how we pursue happiness. 

Not saying this was Freeda's case-- but I think often as **successful Black women who functionally struggle with mental health**, our goal is to ""get it all,"" because our hope is that it will almost compensate for our depression and anxiety. And what ends up happening is, we get so busy with the pursuit of profit (versus the pursuit of peace or purpose), that we often place our mental health on the back end. Overworking is often a great distraction from depression because it leaves us with little to no time to address it.

Then, when we begin to achieve certain levels of success, we find ourselves being able to afford two things:

>1) The material stuff we thought would make us happy and,  
>  
>2) we can afford more time to ourselves - meaning more time to think and be left alone with our suppressed thoughts. 

However, the things we thought would make us happy, doesn't. And the **idle time leads to idle thinking and if your thoughts are dark, it can be dangerous.**

Now we're **overpaid and underwhelmed in life**, and feeling a way about it. I really think that, although it is nice to be a successful Black woman, we need to start having more discussions, and expand our description of what is ""goals."" Money is good too, but let's also be just as enthusiastic about our mental health.

**George Foreman** tweeted that his daughter Freeda had 2 degrees, brought ""home the bacon,"" had a husband and two kids. She also boxed, and the Foreman empire is worth $300 Million.

**Titi Branch** (co-founder of the very success Miss Jessie's haircare line) **also committed suicide.**

Heck, even on TV, we see characters like **Being Mary Jane** and **Olivia Pope** straight up be successful but also self-sabotaging as hell (mostly in their personal lives). I also low-key think they are functioning alcoholics, which many of us either are or know those who are  ( let's be real, they chug that wine or vodka quick when sh\*t hits the fan. That wine is a quick way to self-medicate those bad nerves onset from anxiety).

I'm just saying -- I hope for the day when more of our sistas can casually talk about our mental health over brunch mimosas, and do more ""check-ins"" in our group chats. I can't wait for such discussions to be normalized and not just ""niche"" amongst us few.",1552505286.0,suicide

28,,"Was my black friend was manipulated to be suicidal by white ""feminists"" ?",21,7pq46a,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/7pq46a/was_my_black_friend_was_manipulated_to_be/,11,"I am concerned about my friend/acquaintance who has become suicidal and wrote a long blog post about being suicidal due to racism from white ""feminists."" (She has been trying to talk to them about racism for a long time, and some of them seem to try to listen and make change but I know some of them also hate her for it, for her effectiveness at confronting racism and would like to attack her. Some of these women are also very underhanded and manipulative). 

Maybe she could have been slightly suicidal before but I feel like it was majorly exacerbated by the following incident. Recently someone posted this article about racism and suicide in black women/girls. This article approached racism towards black women from a questionable perspective and which whether consciously or unconsciously put across the idea that, given the intensity of racism, it's a rational choice for black women and girls to want to die, end their lives and to kill themselves, and black women who suicide made a rational choice and rational cost benefit analysis. For some people experiencing racism it could be a rational choice to want to end their lives because the oppression is so bad. 

A few days later my black friend who works closely with these white feminists, posted this blog post about how the racism from white women is making her suicidal and directly linking the two. (I couldn't help but notice the glaring similarity from her blog post to the original article posted). I'm afraid that she could get ""sicker"" now because white women might show her a few crumbs of empathy (which they are doing with her blog post) and then she will learn that she has to use her life as a bargaining chip to talk about racism towards women of colour with white feminists and it's the only way to  make them listen. I am concerned about her. I am not super close to her because many of these white ""feminists"" that she is hanging out with who have also attacked me many times in the past, but I am concerned about her. I'm not sure what I should do. What do you think ? My gut feeling is that my friend was viciously (and underhandedly) attacked.

(To be honest I feel this article may have engendered that copycat suicide issue where people who are in pain feel a suicide victim got empathy, and then they feel like this is the only way they too can get empathy and care and they have to use their lives as a bargaining chip. 

I read this article and agreed with some of it but also as a woman of colour who faced intense racism I won't lie, reading this article made me feel suicidal too. I handled my feelings because I know that you can take anyone and torture them and torture them until they beg for death, and for people facing racial oppression, they can feel suicidal because the pain and oppression is violating and warping our ""judgement"" but we don't really want to die and it's not really our idea to want to die (even if oppression is very bad). It's the intensity of the oppression speaking. It is not a choice.) Anyway I am concerned about my friend. I'm not sure what I should say to her. I'm worried about being manipulated too, since this is basically a huge white ""feminist"" cesspool she is in the middle of and people she is close to have attacked me on many occasions. (Also I'm concerned that other black women in this group could start getting ""suicidal"" as well). Do you have any ideas of how I could help or should I stay out of it ?",1515695148.0,suicide

I enjoyed talking to them both and wanted to even ask them to hang out. I want to learn more about them. We have a lot of shared interests including anime n cars. Long story short I was going thru a lot at the time to the point where I stopped texting them. including losing my job, becoming homeless for 2 months, my grandpa dying and being sexually harassed/stalked. I suffer from depression and suicidal ideation, and the past 6 months those situations triggered it so bad. I feel really embarrassed because not only did I not communicate with them but it’s been 6 months since. I really want to reconnect with them and get to know them because I want to be their friend!

Details: I --55--live in the upstairs apartment of my parents 2-fam house. Mom is downstairs. We lost Dad two years ago. My parents were married for 60+ years. After losing her husband, she lost two of her closest friends. She's been grieving and depressed for two years. But also refuses to do anything about it, including just talking to people who care about her. There's a clear break in our relationship. BCO-Before Coming Out (30+ years ago)--we were  close, best friends. ACO she's been verbally abusive to me since. Largely because of that abuse I've had a history of prolonged depression, anxiety and suicidality. I've been hospitalized for suicidal thoughts twice. She knows this. Though I live upstairs, I keep my distance from her to protect my mental health. I've given up trying to get her to understand how her verbal violence--gaslighting, dismissiveness, refusal of accountability--just plain fucks me up. I now only communicate through letters I leave for her and only when necessary.  I plan to move out next year, largely for self-preservation. None of this is the relationship I want with my mother who may leave me soon. I have a younger brother whom she adores and treats very well. He lives with his fam in another part of our city. Okay, on to today's episode.

I've spent more time around her recently. She fell a couple weeks ago. Mostly it's been cool. No deep conversations, but I check on her, get things she needs. There have been some laughs. It's given me a micro dose of hope. We were supposed to run 3 errands today. We did the first 2 which were close to the house. But on the way to the 3rd, she snapped at me. I know it's her profound depression about aging and loss. Still, I have a zero-tolerance for that energy from her, especially knowing that it could get worse. So I told her I was taking her home since she was in a bad mood. She snapped some more and I dropped her off. I took a long drive after my errand and returned to keeping my distance. When she called me tonight to return her car key, I went down and placed it on the table. She called again shortly after asking me to return something else saying, ""Please give it to me in my hand, not just sneak in. I know I'm such a terrible person that you don't want to be around me. I won't be here long."" She was crying. This is manipulation 101. But my mom's tears are my Kryptonite. I've trained myself to let her words wash over me, generally. But now I feel like I should respond. Manipulation works. I don't know why the idea that I don't spend time with people who are mean to me  is so difficult for her to comprehend. So she can either be mean to me with the understanding that I'm going to distance. OR be respectful and aware of how her words affect me and I'll be around. Those are the only options. It's not even that it's difficult for her to understand. It's that she thinks I should just suck it up if she's cruel. Mom is old school Panamanian-Jamaican. So there's this expectation of daughters in particular to just do for mothers, revere them w/o complaint. To do anything else is disrespectful. I've told her that that's not me. I've also said that I love her and having to distance myself at this time in her life crushes my soul. That I actually wish I could spend as much time as possible with her. But it doesn't sink in and she doesn't have nor wish to acquire the tools. Thanks.",1671423929.0,suicide

I’ve gone through my entire life trying my best to conform because my moms a first generation immigrant and would feed me a lot of respectability politics which ended up making me hate everything about myself - I hated my features, the texture of my hair, my body, etc.

And tbh I still kind of do struggle with that. I have struggles with eating disorders, depression, and suicidal thought because of this hatred of myself.

I try to stay positive and ignore negative stuff that’ll cause me to think negatively but that’s really hard since social medias filled with toxic people and I tend to use that a lot even though I probably shouldn’t. 

I often disassociate entirely to cope and think of myself in different bodies, or with a different race, different life, etc. 

I’m in therapy right now to treat my depression but my therapist can’t really do much at all since my mom refuses to allow me to have access to the medication I need.

I don’t go out that much anymore either, i don’t have any friends. I feel very lonely and I sometimes i think to myself why I was put on this earth as a black woman, why couldn’t I be born anything else ?

65,,Struggling with Internalized Racism,109,q6wwr1,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/q6wwr1/struggling_with_internalized_racism/,33,"So I (19) have sort of recently realized that growing up with my (mostly) white adoptive family in a mostly white town has instilled deep deep notions of internalized racism. I’m mixed (although I only found out I’m half black earlier this year). My parents are older and quite conservative so this shouldn’t be surprising to me. But it’s really upsetting to suddenly realize this and try to unlearn it. 

My family makes some anti-black statements often (sometimes it’s not as noticeably anti black but it still internalizes within me). I’m noticing that when I see something associated with black culture or another black person I hear my mom’s judgements voice first and I have to try to shake it away. I think one of the reasons I’m having a lot of trouble with this is I don’t “feel” black. I know I’m black, I say I’m black, I look black, but I constantly feel like I’m living outside of the black experience, I know my experience is the black experience but I feel like I’m on the outside of the community (most likely because I physically am, there’s really no black people where I live). I guess the best way I could put it is I feel like a white person masquerading as a black person/mixed person, I feel like I’m intruding. (It sounds kinda dumb ik).

I’m trying to unlearn my internal prejudices but it’s hard because I still live with my parents and have to still hear my mom say stuff like “well you don’t *look* black!” (When I very obviously do. This brings upon a whole new issue of not feeling black enough but that’s off topic). Or I’ll hear my parents say how the black panthers were the black KKK. Huey Newton is one of my favorite revolutionaries, I just bought Revolutionary Suicide and I hope to read it without my mother knowing. But I know all the black revolutionaries I look up to would probably be so disgusted and disappointed with me for this. 

The more I try to fix myself the worse it gets. I’m not sure what to do. I hate myself for this and I feel so ashamed for subconsciously adopting these racist views. I’m hoping to eventually be able to seek therapy for this. But in the meantime I wanted to share this here to see if anyone else could relate so I feel less alone.

I texted my job and told them I would be in on Friday. 

All day Thursday I literally thought about suicide. I came up with a plan. I was going to kick my fiance out of the apartment and do it. Thursday he had a tough day and didnt want to make it harder on him. Friday morning I tried to go in but I figured I would be dead by Tuesday anyway, so what's the point? I didn't even call in. I just stayed at home and didnt do anything. I then decided I should kick my boyfriend out of my apartment and break things off before the weekend so he wouldnt find me. I couldnt do it.

I kept pushing back and pushing back when I would do it. Until I realized I don't *really* want to do it anymore. Mostly for him. He's been through enough. I can stick it out for him. If I died it would break him.

Hello everyone, posting here since this subreddit makes me feel comfortable. I’ve had bad, undiagnosed, unmanaged anxiety for years now. My anxiety doesn’t usually manifest as panic attacks, it manifests as extreme overthinking and physical symptoms (headaches, heartaches, heart palpitations, breathlessness etc). I was able to genuinely enjoy myself today as I went out with my beautiful friends to a restaurant we’ve been dying to go to. The food was good, everything was great. I felt genuine happiness. Unfortunately that happiness was brought down quickly. I got a text from my friend (another friend) whilst I was out that she didn’t want to live anymore. I called her, texted her and texted her Mum, no one has responded. Everything came back, all the anxiety, guilt and depression hit me hard. She is my best friend and has been there for me in my darkest hours and if only I hadn’t put my phone on silent I would have responded quicker. I’ve cried for hours and now I just feel empty. I can’t visit her as she lives in Cornwall, I live in the Midlands (which is 8hours on the train and £200+) I hate to make it about myself but it seems like everytime I am feeling slightly more okay, everything around me falls apart, as if my perpetual state of sadness and poor mental health is a punishment for my existence.

Edit: I noticed the text when I had come home a few hours ago, she texted me in the midst of the outing. My phone was on silent when we got to the restaurant. No one has responded and its been 4 hours.

The caption(s) read ""me if there's any black girls at the function"" or wtv, and the joke is that they're leaving if there's any black women/girls. I really try hard to not let silly things on the internet mess with my brain but sometimes I really can't take it anymore, and my brain goes to mush. There were multiple similar videos under this trend, each amassing hundreds and thousands of likes. Does anybody remember those  twitter/Instagram eras where being a darkskin girl was like the funniest joke ever for some reason? And how everybody joined hands just to degrade us? I hated being 8-12 during those eras. Even tho I weren't on social media, those jokes were always prevalent, especially in school. From the youngest age Ive been constantly been reminded of how ugly and inferior I am.  And the gaslighting is always is insane. ""Its a preference."" ""Why're you getting mad at other peoples preferences?"" IDC abt ur preference, but why do you want me and other black girls to feel so ugly?  It hurts even more that these jokes are posted by black boys/men. I hate to be like this but I feel no other demographic make their women the butt of the joke like how we get treated. And I know there are great black guys out there and I never want to generalize, but the disparities are insane. Everyday I'm being fed constant subliminal messages that I'm ugly for being a black girl, that all men will choose other girls over us, I left twitter for this reason and migrated to tik tok, I did my best to not interact with racial topics to keep a happy FYP with cute animals and games but I STILL get hit those tik toks . 

It hurts, it really does and I'm tired of pretending it doesn't, tired of pretending to be care free. It makes me suicidal, it makes fear of having a female child. My brain constantly reminds me that brining a black female in this world would be cruel and selfish.  I don't want to be sold a message that I should look for appreciation ""elsewhere"" , either cause it's not a good feeling. I simply wanna b left alone. I'm 17, becoming an adult in a few months, and this shit gets so fucking old. I seriously fear for the younger black girls in this generation. My heart breaks in a million pieces thinking about young black girls coming across these tik toks or fonky ass tweets. Or the Ariel backlash. Or the ratchet jokes.

I feel unsupported and rushed while feeling like a failure all at the same time.

So career wise: I am currently unemployed. I have no degree (am currently enrolled in SNHU and plan to start classes next month) and limited work experience, mainly customer service/retail. I'm trying to get out of that industry. I think we all know why. I live with my mother, sister, and brother in a cramped up two bedroom apartment with a toddler. My mom wants me to get a job while in school. But all the jobs ready to hire someone like me are customer service jobs with inhumanely low pay. I know I need a job too, not only to have money for myself and my future but to help out around the house. I've tried going for admin assistant jobs but I get no callbacks. I don't know what to do. I could do a trade school but that still requires money that I don't have. 

Mental health wise: I cannot get or recieve any help from the government or anyone for therapy. I tried to get Medicaid for mental health and they only approved me for family planning. My case worker said I could try healthcare.gov. Filled out the application and the only plans I could receive were ones that thad me paying hundreds my monthly or thousands out of pocket still. The government literally won't help me with my mental health. I've tried betterhelp but it was pretty much a waste of time. They also have it in their contract that they are not accountable for the quality of the therapists that they employ. I've tried 211 but it still leads to services that costs money.

I'm at my wits end. I'm tired of asking for help and nobody sees me or nobody listens. I've been depressed since I was eight. People lie and tell you that things get better and they don't. I feel like I'm in a prison, one that this country set up for poor black folk and another that I set up for myself. I don't want to commit suicide but I really do feel that's the right choice for me.

- I started crocheting and they said that they were “surprised that I can have crochet needles” because I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts lately

- I told them I was making a love letter pencil pouch and their first reaction was to say “that’s gay.” my friends frequently say this about things that are romance related (we’re all queer) but it just rubs me the wrong way and seems very juvenile.

- this one is hard to talk about and I’m still grappling with it. (tw: SA?) whenever I go to their house they always offer me drinks because whenever I drink enough I loosen up and allow them to touch me

- says the n word with hard r in a joking way which makes me very uncomfortable 

- I told them I want to get sober and am considering rehab and they said “no don’t go because (my ex’s name) is coming back into town and this summer we’re gonna be drinking and smoking”

- didn’t check on me during my depressive episode 

- lied that they were just hanging out with a friend when in reality they were at a concert with said friend. said they didn’t wanna tell me because they didn’t wanna make me upset

all of these situations, especially the crochet and drink one have really got to me. I am hesitant to cut them off even though I know I should.

With that being said, I had the shittiest year of my life (and I've never said that before this year, I love life lol and don't take it for granted). Was homeless for most of the year (298 days but who's counting right), lucky to eat one meal a day, didn't have a phone for 2 months, got into a car accident (aka a sleep spot), had no bed woke up w bug bites every morning, yada yada. I moved into a place last week and just told my family yesterday...

They are so happy for me and ecstatic I figured it out on my own, they knew I could do it!!!

But earlier this year when I told them I was suicidal, they didn't call or message me back for four days. My mom called me PYT (googled it: poor white trash) because I was homeless. What hurts the most is that my little sister doesn't respond to me anymore and we've ALWAYS been close. Now they're happy and want to come over? I understand they did not know how to help me, I can't blame them for that, but this all feels so fake. I felt neglected and lonely. Poor communication for almost a year but now bringing me hand me downs for my new home??

Like most people my 2020 was absolute garbage, my quarantine started in January of 2020 after my landlords negligence in keeping the sidewalks shoveled caused me to break my leg while walking. Being in the service industry, I was unable to work for the entire month of February and during that time I would say that my alcoholism went from ‘moderate’ to ‘functioning’. I was stressed because I’m an active person that had to stop and sit overnight. I was drinking pretty heavily during that time because I was bored and depressed being out of work and watching the news about Covid and learning about the details of Ahmaud Arbery’s murder.

By the time I was back to work in March, Covid had really ramped up in the US and I worked for less than two weeks before the state of Minnesota shut down for quarantine. I did not handle it well, especially since quarantine started the same day that Breonna Taylor was murdered (we have the same first name including pronunciation), I had the news on in the background when her murder was announced and it really disturbed me to hear her name and all of the details of her murder. Like so many other Black people I’ve always had that fear of being murdered by the police for no reason, but to hear her name was my name was a feeling I never hope to experience ever again. Ahmad Arbery’s murder details were still emerging as well. I was also alone all the time as my husband was able to continue working and I was pretty much self-medicating in the only way I knew how.

On May 21, 2020 I was able to sober up just long enough to go to the store, on my way home a comedian on the comedy channel I was listening to was making rape jokes. As a survivor of rape I immediately flew into a PTSD rage, I’d been having suicidal thoughts for awhile, but that was the last straw. I started speeding, all I wanted to do was crash into at tree. I’m unsure what happened next, but my brain shut off and my body took over and the next thing I know I was parked outside of my home shaking uncontrollably, crying hysterically. I went into the house and confessed to my husband what I had tried to do, he immediately called my parents to come over. My Dad took me to the hospital, but because of Covid, he was told to leave as soon as we got to the hospital. I was alone and scared in a waiting room telling an intake nurse about the past two years of my life and what led up to me being suicidal, that would be the first of six times that I would have to tell that traumatic story in the next day and a half. I was then escorted by two armed policemen to my “room” where I had to take off my clothes, surrender all my belongings, and wear dark red scrubs. A doctor eventually came hours later and promised that I could go upstairs to receive help as soon as my Covid test came back negative. That was a lie. I spent all of Thursday night and all of Friday stuck in that room. The only silver lining was a good friend of mine was a nurse in the mental health ward and provided comfort for me and relayed information to my husband about what was going on. Friday night I told the staff that I wanted to be discharged. Instead, they finally sent me to the upstairs area (escorted by an armed police officer) at ten o’clock at night. I was finally able to take a shower and could relax a little and read a book, but not before I had to retell my trauma story again. On Saturday I demanded that I be discharged and was finally allowed to go home, only after my friend advocated for me to a sympathetic doctor who understood my frustration.

My husband picked me up and we ended up taking Chicago Ave. home, as we drove past Cup Foods I remember making a silly remark about how my brother used to shop there when he lived around the corner. I was drinking heavily again by Sunday night, and by Monday evening George Floyd had been brutally murdered.

From then on my alcoholism went from ‘functioning’ to ‘non-functioning. I couldn’t deal with anything at all, I felt guilt at being suicidal, I was angry that another Black person had been murdered by police, I was furious that out-of-town white nationalist were burning down my city while Black residents were being blamed. In the weeks that followed I remember reading all the terrible things people were saying to try and justify not only George Floyd’s murder, but Breonna Taylor’s, Ahmaud Arbery’s, Philando Castile’s, Tamir Rice’s, Botham Jean’s, Atatiana Jefferson’s, Mike Brown’s, Sandra Bland’s and every other poor defenseless soul that was unfairly taken too soon.

On June 6th, I served my first shift since March. I was deeply traumatized by it. Driving to work I had to see all the damage the the white nationalist had done to my city, one of my friends had her salon destroyed, another had his clothing store burned. The restaurant I worked at had a window broken out, everything along Lyndale Ave. was boarded up. As soon as I clocked in I bought a double shot of whiskey and downed it. I’ll never forget how insufferable and oblivious my tables were, if I hadn’t been tipsy I would have gone off. Table after table of yt people without a care whining about having to wear a mask and social distance as though there was no global pandemic or complaining that there was a curfew in place as though there was no social justice movement happening. At one point, it started to rain, my table was under their patio umbrella while I was standing next to them getting rained on as they debated for several minutes about what to order. I completely broke inside, I felt unseen, unheard and less than nothing. By the time I got off work I was starting to get the DT’s, so I rushed home started taking shots and cried in the shower until the water turned cold. I took a leave of absence from work to focus on my mental health, which really meant drinking too much and arguing with racist strangers online.

On June 18th I was standing over the kitchen sink at 7:45 am after my husband left for work, vomiting and shaking from the DT’s while in my bathrobe drinking shots of vodka so I could try to sleep. In that moment all I could think is how if anything ever happened to me at the hands of the racist police of this city or any city, all the racist “thin blue line” losers would just use my alcoholism as an excuse for why I deserved to be murdered and blame me as they have so many other unfortunate Black souls. I called my husband, parents, and brother and told them that I needed to meet with all of them together. That night, I confessed that I was an alcoholic (to no one’s surprise) and I needed help. The next day my wonderful therapist helped me find a rehab center, it was the Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Springs, CA. I was there for three weeks in July and I’ve been sober ever since. I went back to work at the end of August, but only as a host and food runner. 

Daunte Wright was murdered this past Sunday across town, as usual the racists are trying to justify his murder because of things that are completely irrelevant, also because they are trashy barely human beings. I hate that I’ll never relapse because racist cops will always be out there committing crimes while lying about it. I’ve also learned that relapsing and the forgiveness that comes with from society is definitely a privilege reserved for yt people.

As much as I love the city of Minneapolis, I’m not going to miss the racist police force or liberal white racism. My husband and I are trading it in for the liberal white racism of Austin, TX (at least the winters are shorter). I’m also no longer in the service industry and now work and thrive happily in a bakery.

I had a major meltdown at that job and took it out on the customer. I've been dealing with pressure from my parents to get a full time job which hasn't been working because I keep getting rejections.

I don't really want to say the specific country that my parents come from, so I will be saying West African or African, but please know I do in fact understand that Africa isn't a country nor is African an ethnicity lol.


I (18f) was raised in the American suburbs by two immigrant parents from the same West African country. Before I went to pre k I pretty much lived in my parents' culture despite being in America. I watched American TV, but that was it. Customs were African, my first language was the one more spoken on my father's side. As I progressed through elementary school, my parents' culture was still pretty much what I knew. I went to a public, predominantly white school , and had a few close white friends (internalized anti blackness from the get go) but I wasn't allowed to have play dates with anybody but a friend from the same country that I had made, really. 

I don't know exactly the timeline, but around middle school, these things happened:

• I started speaking more English at home. I have no idea the direct reason for this, it may have to do with my next bullet points


• I started arguing with my mom a lot. As I wanted to develop a style and personality and whatever, my mom definitely hated it. Typical story of parents hating when you become your own person. 


• My mom became increasingly verbally and emotionally demeaning and controlling, and would say things like ""obey your parents"" and ""that's how we do it in [country]"" and quoting the bible and West African tradition to justify it. So my 11-13 year old self started hating my culture, blaming it for everything. I lost interest in it, because at that point, all this culture was for me was strict Christianity and emotional abuse. I know this part is very stupid of me but I really just couldn't separate the harm from the rest of the culture. 



I started submerging myself in and admiring American culture. To me it seemed so cool. Whooping your kids being seen as abuse and not just necessary discipline. Children allowed to hang out with friends outside of school. Children having conversations with parents and just good relationships with them. So me hating my culture and loving American culture caused me at a young age to just distance myself from my West African culture. It also didn't help that I realized I was queer. As I said before, I stopped speaking my language at home at some point . The timeline here is really iffy cuz it definitely could have started in elementary school. 




When I noticed my grasp on my culture slipping I did not know what to do. I'm 18 now, and my relationship with my parents have only gotten worse. It took two suicide attempts (the most recent one being about 8 months ago in late 2021) for my dad to realize that he needed to change his ways, and my mom just thinks I cry for attention. With both of them, they have never taught me that it's okay to be vaulnerable to them, and I do not feel comfortable talking to them about them reteaching me the language. But I really wish I knew it. I used to be fluent, now I can't even respond to my family in anything other than English. 



If you've made it this far, I'm asking for advice. What is the best way to reconnect with my culture that isn't through my parents or family? (I have no trusted family members. I distrust all of them because Im under the belief they're just like my parents). I don't know how to learn the language. I wouldn't say it's rare but I really can't find many resources on it, especially compared to a really well known language from my country.",1658044589.0,suicide

I've served my purpose here, gotten my degree, and at  I'm ready to move on. Except I won't be able to move out until the end of the year. 
Once I left campus life I realized what the real world environment of this town was like. I come from a predominantly white town most call racist so I thought I would be well prepared for more racism. No. The racism out here is ridiculous. I've gotten a death threat working for a former paralyzed cop, I was too afraid to report it because they would back the blue before they believe a black girl. I've gotten a ""speeding ticket"" which resulted in a $230 fine along with a license suspension (my first one ever by the way) for slowing down and policing the police since they had three cop cars on one unarmed black guy. I got hired and fired from a manager position within a week for having ""Black Lives Matter"" on my car (every single customer had Trump gear so I think enough of them complained and got me fired for it). I was rejected access to my campus library even though I showed my ID and proof said it worked to open the Campus Library doors. Worst roommate experience imaginable. I was almost fired for getting injured on the job when the white female coworker who was training me was driving was drunk (she also stole tips, never received consequences, write-ups, etc). And most recently, I got fired out of retaliation for reporting sexual harrassment. When I spoke up, a few others did too; we all got fired and the harrasser still works there. 
I say all that to say... I'm emotionally exhausted. I've passively and actively thought about suicide, still do. This was supposed to be my 💰grind💰year and it just sucks that I can't reach my goals due to things outside of my control. Not being able to work for months plus not getting unemployment during the entire pandemic has just added more stress, I'm sure some can relate. 
My new strategy for my new job is to not talk, keep my head down, which is weird for me because I easily make acquaintances due to my bubbly personality.

Double plot twist: The husband knew this whole time and plotted to go home catch them and do a triple suicide.  

 
 
 
Also for those who know Scandal Olivia’s client lost to her and Fitz during the election and ever since he became obsessed with that feeling of being a loser and all that.
 
 
  
This made me think because with what happened last week and Emmet Till . I was looking at my screen like « Sis how you gone keep defend that? » like This woman screamed rape and had someone killed. You’re telling me a black woman didn’t have odd feelings other than « you lied to me. » and didn’t think of something else than how she’s gonna deal with her client’s lies. Like I feel like she could’ve dropped the client. 
 
 

 
 Also the husband monologue had me sick. He was talking about how Brilliant his wife  was for screaming rape and how « rape » was a beautiful word. And mind you before that double twist despite his « you lied to me, I’m a killer now due to this » he was still over there trying to keep his wife out of jail and Olivia was over there putting up with that.
 
 
 
 Maybe I’m sensitive but I feel like that scenario was odd. And I know as a black Woman I couldn’t help someone who lied about rape I would’ve been like «nah you and Becky get tf outta here » .

88,,How To Help Yourself When You're Feeling Depressed,36,r64czl,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/r64czl/how_to_help_yourself_when_youre_feeling_depressed/,9,"I am no stranger to FEELING depressed. 

I have  battled with low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts, and hopelessness. 

Y'all, I be going through it sometimes. 

But I know that I will always overcome whatever I am feeling even when it feels like I will not. 

I wanted to share some actions I have taken to make myself feel better. 

Before I dive in, I have to share a bit more about myself. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 18 someone really close to me was murdered, and it shook my world. I have been dealing with bouts of depression for 10 years, and I finally think I have a handle on it. 

Here is what I want to share with you all: 

One. Remember that depression is a feeling. And feelings change. Whatever you are feeling is not  permenant. Always give yourself time to deeply feel whatever it is you need to feel. 

Two. Do everything in your power to create a lifestyle that suits your needs. I consider myself a highly sensitive person. Because I know this about myself, I made a choice not to work a normal 9-5. It has taken a lot of effort, but I work for myself. In working for myself, I am able to create a lifestyle where I can cater to my own needs instead of performing for colleagues everyday. 

I am aware that everyone may not be able to work for themselves, so I suggest you find ways to make more time for yourself so that you can give yourself more of what you need. 

Three. Take it easy on yourself. This is your first life (that you know of lol) and you are not gonna have everything figured out by 24 or 28. Approach everyday like there are new lessons to be learned. Make mistakes and do not judge yourself for it.  

Four. Act like you are the only person in your world that matters. Yes, you will lose friends. Yes, your family will talk about you and think you are selfish. Yes, you will feel guilty. But you only get one life. If you are worried about everyone else, you may be hurting yourself even more. At the end of the day, you are all you got. When you die, it will only be you in that casket so you have to live for you! Once your cup is overflowing, then your true loved ones will be blessed as well. 

Five. Get you a therapist. Therapy was the best thing that happened to me. It was an investment in myself. I paid $75 every week for a year. Therapy was my favorite part of the week and it was part of my self-care routine. Go to therapyforblackgirls.com and find you a therapist. And if you do not  have the money, there is at least one person in your life who wants to see you happy, so ask them for support. 

Six. Turn off the lights and sit in the darkness. There is SOOOOOOOOO much beauty in the darkness. Think about it: you were born from the darkness of your mothers womb. Go into the darkness and find yourself. You will NEVER find what you are looking for in the world, it can only be found on the inside. Once you tap into the darkness, your life will change. Because the more you become comfortable with yourself the more you will be able to get yourself out of depression. 

Think of life as a frequency. There are some ups and there are some downs. Without the ebb and flow, there would just be a flatline..... 

I hope this helps one of you ladies feel better and strong enough to face tomorrow!!!",1638326538.0,suicide

90,,Mental Health/Substance Abuse Disorders in the Black community,20,1ez6fm,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1ez6fm/mental_healthsubstance_abuse_disorders_in_the/,11,"May is almost over, but this month also represents Mental Health Awareness Month (I actually only discovered this a week before May began). Mental Health is one of my biggest passions, for career, educational, and personal reasons. I'm very big about advocacy to reduce stigma surrounding mental health/SUDs for the recovering community. I received my degree in Psychology and plan to go back for my Masters in Public (Mental) Health. Recently, I have begun to learn more about SUDs and their connection to mental health issues because I am currently working for a non-profit organization that researches substance abuse treatment and prevention methods/programs across the country. And on a personal note, I have mental health issues of my own.

As a black girl growing up in a predominantly black community before leaving for college, I noticed that there wasn't a lot of discussion regarding mental health and SUDs. Even in the media, mental health is mainly seen as a ""White person issue."" They seemed like very taboo subjects in the community, and that was particularly hard for me. I've been managing to live a normal llife while struggling with anxiety (GAD/social anxiety) and depression since the age of 10 (I'm going on 23 now). I've been on anti-depressants and have been in and out of therapy since my junior year of college. I often wish that I could be more open about my struggles with anxiety and how I'm managing to get through life as a (semi) normal 20-something. 

Mental health and SUDs has also affected my family. If anyone has ever seen the show *Hoarders* on TLC, my grandfather could very easily fit in as one of the ""hoarders"" on the show. Hoarding is actually a type of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). My grandfather died when I was 12, and from what I remember, he never received any help for his condition; in fact, no one in my family really spoke of his problem until I brought it up a couple of years ago. My granddad's house from the outside looked like a simple country home in Greensboro, AL, but on the inside was another story. The floor was littered with stacks of unread newspapers that had been there for as long as I can remember. My grandfather's room upon his dead was uninhabitable; the door could barely be opened because of all the junk he piled into the small room, and there were pans full of stale urine because he chose to pee in the pans rather than leave his room. The only room in the house that had been cleaned after my grandfather died was the foyer. My mother also told me stories of my grandfather digging into the trashcan to retrieve my dirty diapers when I was baby because ""they could be used for some reason in the future."" 

My uncle also suffered from mental health issues and had an addiction problem for most of his life. He was my mother's middle brother, and while I wasn't as close to him as my other uncles, I do remember him fondly. Towards the end of his life, he began to abuse drugs again (Opiates and Cocaine if I remember correctly) and at one point disappeared without a word. No one had heard from him for months. Around Christmas of 2010, my mother and I had just returned from Germany to see my brother get married to his now wife. Before we had even reached Customs after an overseas flight, my mother got a phone call from her uncle that her brother was dead. He was found in an abandoned house. He had been deceased for a while. I didn't know the whereabouts of his death until a year later. He had committed suicide. 

To those who I am close with, I have always been very open about my struggles: From mental breakdowns throughout high-school and some of college, to nearly attempted suicide when I was 13, to my more successful recovery now. But I still find that mental health and SUDS are taboo subjects to most, and especially in the black community. I didn't know that there were many other black professionals in the mental health and addictions field until I got my job as a research associate at the non-profit I work at.

I realize it's a bit of a heavy subject, but I've always been curious to know everyone's thoughts regarding mental illness and SUDs. What are your personal experiences? What are your thoughts? And if anyone as any other questions about my experiences with anxiety/depression, I'd be happy to answer them!

**EDIT**: I also want to add that also having social anxiety while being in a community where we are largely known for being more vocal and extroverted was no easy task!",1369411156.0,suicide

92,,Rosa Parks AND Bland?,24,3exgns,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/3exgns/rosa_parks_and_bland/,6,"(I posted this on /news/ but didn't get any comments. I didn't post here because I thought I'd be ""preaching to the choir"" but now I'm doing so).

Yes! There is an expression in the Black community: “You can't win for losin').  To preserve life in a society steeped in racism, one opts for the path of least resistance: compliance.

The consequences of disobedience are obvious but what if one is punished for compliance? This is enough to upset the apple cart of reason and send one over the edge.

25 years ago I heard Rosa Parks speak at a church on Adams in Los Angeles. She set the historical record straight. Initially, she was compliant. She sat in the Negro section as was expected. She only became defiant when the driver demanded she stand even though the seat next to her was empty, so that someone white could sit next to empty space rather than next to a Negro.

Under Jim Crow, if you were Negro, you could sit in the front of the bus IF the bus route began in the Negro community. But as the demographics changed, and white folk boarded, then you had to sit further back, though still in the “front.”  Front and back were relative as long as you, a Negro, were behind a white patron. In some buses, there were flags inserted in the seats that could be moved to designate that dividing line.

So Ms. Parks was compliant. She obeyed Jim Crow. She sat in the back of the bus in the Negro section. In spite of this compliance she was threatened with punishment for not yielding even more. When compliance fails, one's sense of reality is called to question.

Fortunately for Ms. Parks her roots in the Black community buttressed her sense of reality in the midst of confusing signals. She was a youth worker for NAACP. NAACP was meanwhile looking for a test case to challenge Jim Crow law. She did not say at that lecture if this was on her mind when she was on that bus but I imagine that that foundation was already laid for her to choose defiance without losing her mental reference points.

Sandra Bland. When Ms. Bland was driving in Texas, and saw a police car advancing behind her, she immediately switched lanes to get out of the way and allow its advance.  This was an emergency maneuver that didn't allow time to use the turn signal.  

Essentially, the cop stopped her and proceeded to punish her by citation, for her compliance. He then proceeded to dehumanize her by demanding she put out her cigarette, that she get out of the car, etc. Punished for compliance? It's enough to upset the apple cart of reason, the result being suicide.

This is a straight-up case of Driving While Black and one of a litany of examples of domestic terrorism.

The consequence of disobedience is punishment. The consequence of obedience is punishment.

93,,my friend created an evolving list of what to do/what she's focusing on in the wake of the election and i thought i'd share it here. feel free to add to it.,59,5cfsan,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/5cfsan/my_friend_created_an_evolving_list_of_what_to/,7,"my evolving list of what to do/what i'm focusing on, incomplete and imperfect, feel free to add. some of these are things I feel comfortable giving advice on and some I'm trying to learn too. let's talk please and continue to hold each other close.

1. Read up on fascist/authoritarian regimes and resistance (one link I've found helpful, more recs welcome:http://www.nybooks.com/…/trump-election-autocracy-rules-fo…/ )

2. Read up on which policies can go through fastest, how they go through, how they can be blocked (some useful links: http://obamacarefacts.com/…/what-does-president-trump-mean…/ , http://www.npr.org/…/fact-check-donald-trumps-first-100-day… ; http://www.latimes.com/…/la-na-pol-trump-executive-power-20…

3. Self defense classes - take one, organize one. ones happening this weekend in ny are filling up fast. If you're a member of a group who will be targeted by his supporter's and want to arm yourself I'm not gonna stop you, just be sure to get the skills to ensure your weapon isn't used against you. Self defense works if you work it - talk to your friends about your different techniques and quiz yourself on what you'd do in different situations.

4. Suicide prevention - learn how to respond if you see or hear warning signs. learn how to do a suicidal ideation assessment. learn how to intervene without calling 911 and how to assemble a team of support. Make a safety plan for yourself or people you love if you need to (one resource from Icarus Project here - http://theicarusproject.net/…/IcarusNavigatingCrisisHandout…) (I can definitely speak to a lot of this, please reach out if you have questions)

5. Repro health care/general medical care - I want to build up my skills in these arenas - both to be a better bystander and to be able to provide services if shit starts really getting cut. Lola Pelligrino is amazing and is offering some stuff in BK - https://docs.google.com/…/1FAIpQLSdyoMZw8ZuG2K3CQh…/viewform I also plan to to go to this on Saturday - https://www.facebook.com/events/1826783650900082/ I know that I know lots of radical and brilliant doulas who probably have even more good resources on this (teach me how to perform an abortion tbh pls)

6. Figure out what you need to get in order before January (take all docs here with a grain of salt, I've heard some stuff is incomplete or not totally accurate, but you know your body/situation better than anyone else and this is a good starting point - https://docs.google.com/…/1QjiJi4YBbmdnWyTdKDb…/mobilebasic…; https://docs.google.com/…/17Rj40_i39gTuo4hMNNmhToL0…/preview; specifically help w ID changes: http://tldef.org/work_show.php?id=7; another thread for trans people https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/796684713880616961; specific info on immigration: http://www.immigrantjustice.org/…/what-do-next-protect-immi…)

7. Donate to orgs that we will need in the days ahead - larger orgs like ACLU Nationwide and Planned Parenthood Action, and smaller orgs like Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) Many lists available - in NY I would look at North Star Fund's grantees. And look to support work outside of nonprofits as well - more on that soon, recs for places you're donating are welcome. http://www.whatcanido.io/ has a list at the bottom of orgs as well!

8. Offer materials support to people who need it - Tell your trans and POC friends you'll walk them home or call them a cab if you have money to do so (hopefully if you are my friend you know I would do this but just in case - I will always always do this never hesitate to reach out). Give someone who doesn't have access to resources you do or who is too sick or sad to leave the house your seamless password. Donate to individual's immigration funds, gender affirmation surgeries, rent funds, medical care, etc. Supporting survival of people who've always been most marginalized by the state is crucial.

9. Become an active bystander: I have lots of thoughts on this one and would love to work on a workshop with someone if anyone has more skills. There have already been an increase in hate crimes. It's happening all over, including in ""liberal"" pockets like New York. You need to think through how you will respond if you see someone being harassed. My very brief advice - focus on the target of violence/harassment (ask are you ok, do you want ot come with me, put your body physically between harasser and harassed); get other people involved (say specifically - hey you with the green shirt I need your help, hey I'm going to talk to that woman will you talk to the man yelling at her, etc); think through how you will respond if you freeze and what will help you push past freezing.(one guide: http://www.themarysue.com/bystanders-harassment-guide/)

10. To my fellow white people - Talk to me please. I want to figure out what we're doing and I want it to be more than ""having conversations"" but I also want to really get into how we're having those conversations - many people have reached out to me for advice on how to do this stuff and I'm certainly no expert but am always happy to chat and be support for those convos. Also should we be trying to do some sort of “Talk to a trump supporter” action – as someone w no (known) trump supporters in my immediate network I want to figure out how to support people who do and get more white people connected w those white people who did support trump? But also, how are we moving beyond the ally complex to more concrete *action*? Let's talk. On that note, connect to an affinity group if that makes sense to you - Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) for white people, Solidaire for wealthy people, Resource Generation for young wealthy people.

11. To my fellow Jews - I am terrified. I am really really like ancestors screaming in my head to watch out terrified. I have a hard time finding Jewish community but I really want to be connected so please please please reach out. Let's share our histories and share our plans. 76% of us voted against Trump. Let's figure out what's going on with that remaining 24%. Let's step up for folks who are being more directly targeted in areas where we are not, and stay aware of and vigilant about anti-semitism. (and, for Jews and non Jews if you're confused about what anti semitism looks like and how this has been a virulently anti-semitic campaign here's one link let me know if you need more https://www.buzzfeed.com/…/anti-semitism-has-emerged-from-t…)

12. To my fellow sexual assault survivors - this election was one giant trigger, and I think I for some reason felt embarrassed to admit that. I didn't want to admit that he was getting to me on that level. But he did and he will and let's not hide or pretend we're not affected let's stick with each other.

13. Get more of a grip on local politics and what can be changed on a local level, soon. Don't be scared of seeming like a ""bad radical"" for acknowledging that there are REAL IMPACTS on people's lives of laws and who is in power and we need to include that as part of our strategy.

14. Encrypt your shit. Nothing is secure but you can make it more secure. Start by downloading Signal. further guide here: https://medium.com/…/things-to-know-about-web-security-befo…

15. Don't forget to hold on to art and poetry and music and writing. Keep creating and sharing things that are beautiful and joyful and powerful. I'm feeling inspired by Octavia's Brood 

16. Get offline and get together. I'm really freaked out by how isolated myself and others felt due to so much of the election discourse happening online. I don't want that to continue. Talk to each other, get together. Get to know your neighbors if you don't already. I want to see you all. I love you.",1478886349.0,suicide

Seeing her react like that once she saw her reflection on camera devastated me. Because I see so much of myself in her. Her mental anguish, her despair, her pain. I can't stop crying. Definitely re-traumatized me. Opened up all my wounds at once. I'm already a super critical, overthinking perfectionist. So seeing this, as an ebony woman, triggered me in a deep way. I just want to give her the biggest hug in the world and console her. I feel so sorry and helpless because in this cold world, this reality is inevitable. This is a problem that NO one in life deserves. I don't want her to have a tainted, twisted self-esteem like me. Allow me to explain...

The very first time I can recall becoming self-conscious of my looks out in society was sadly in kindergarten by a young Black boy who teased and chastised me for being darker than him. Environmental factors as such made me worship and adore White/mixed/racially ambiguous women. I sacrificed my own opinions and personality traits to follow what said female peers were doing growing up. I used to pray to God wishing for lighter skin, only seek out White Barbie dolls, have my hair relaxed, hope for a pale White or mixed husband to have mixed children with, etc...The rest is history...

Like many women in my position: I've been bullied, teased, called names, and deemed undesirable/unattractive by people on a regular basis. Out in the real world where racial discrimination and prejudice (implicit/covert and explicit/over biases) exist. Relationship wise, I only seem to be ""secret/sidechick material"" and not ""relationship worthy"". As someone who prefers to be with a Black man, it really hurts that many of my perpetrators were in fact Black. One of my sexual assault experiences involved a Black teen boy who sexually violated me in public from behind while I was working on a lab experiment in my middle school science class. Classmates just laughed so I thought at the time that I deserved it. Similar experiences from non-Black men as well. I was sexually assaulted and solicited for sex on my way to my corporate job by a Hispanic male who automatically assumed I was a prostitute ""working the block"" (not that it matters, but I didn't dress provocatively). The only things that are perceivably attractive about me are my derriere, hips, thighs, curves, and long legs. My mind and personality don't seem to matter much. I've never had a meaningful relationship of substance in my 24 years of existence. It's all been sexual objectification, fetishization, ego boost, and/or ""jungle fever"". Honorable mention: there were potential flings that could have been worthwhile, but I was too much of an embarrassment/downgrade or a ""bad look"". These particular guys look the other way due to optics around their friends, but later hit me up religiously on the low in private. I've got a great personality but my hue is ""too intimidating"" or simply ""too much"" as I've come to learn from certain people.

I'm now afraid of intimacy, commitment, and vulnerability in relationships. My natural inner confidence has been broken down over the years. I'm now scared of getting too close with a guy in fear of rejection and being let down. I'm a miserable recipromantic by choice to protect my already shattered heart and spirit. I don't let myself have fun because I feel like I don't deserve it. I don't know what real love is. I refuse to socialize in new settings unless spoken to first. The only times I've been told I was beautiful was out of sympathy and pity, not from genuine sincerity. I'm a ""rare spectacle"" to some who find women like me to be ""exotic"". It's like I can only be admired behind a glass case from a distance with a sign reading ""do not to touch"". I don't look people directly in the eyes, don't like looking at mirrors, don't like taking pictures, and prefer wearing fully covered clothing. I wear make-up as a necessity not an accessory. I'd rather stay at home instead of going out to meet new people because it's what feels safe. 

I'm quiet and keep to myself. I sit and cry by myself in the dark from time to time. I have trust issues and PTSD. I'm a lonely, maladaptive daydreamer who sees herself as a light skin woman as an old coping mechanism to get by. My mom stopped giving me bleaching creams because the manufacturer went out of business. I struggle with depression and contemplated suicide several times in the past (not anymore, no worries there). I let men walk over me and suck all my energy and what's left of my soul knowing good and well they won't commit to me. I know they're simply using me. I let guys string me along for ride where I'm their ""girl"", but only when they're lonely and get involved in label-less/blurred situationships. I willingly excuse toxic relationships subconsciously thinking they're as good as it's ever going to get for me. I only want male progeny because I feel that my female children would be more protected and safer inside my womb than out here in this cruel world. Some Black men who I've come across opt to not be with me simply because they're just as low in esteem and don't want deeply melanated children. It's about the look, appeal, trends, and Instagram for them. To them, it's like ""taking one for the team"" by becoming the ""sacrificial lamb"" going out/being spotted with me. They express interest in women of lighter skin complexion or mixed women as to not have children who have to ""struggle like they have to"".

People seem to pop up in my life only when they need something from me, not genuine check-ins. That's it. I'm a charity case to my fake ""friends"". I'm the butt of jokes, awkward moments, and silences. They intensely filter photos I'm in or intentionally post displeasing ""candid"" photos of me. I feel trapped and unable to be my true self. Unable to be free and live my best life. Society, I feel, ruined the old me. My career and hobbies/interests are really all I have going for me at the moment. 

It's all ironic because I personally love my melanin on a micro-level. I know the science and benefits of it. As a matter of fact I'm entering the medical field soon. I know I don't need friends or a man to make me whole or to bring me happiness, that's something I can only do on my own. But at the same time on the macro-level, due to external circumstances, I've become my own worst critic. I feel helpless, cut open, and broken inside right now...I pray, meditate, and resort to spirituality to temporarily numb my pain all to be reminded of my woes the moment I walk back outside. I can't afford therapy at the moment fyi. These are my own life experiences. I'm trying to shed light on the negative consequences of White supremacy on Black beauty standards from a dark-skin female perspective. I'm sharing part of my life story to inform, not for a ""woe-is-me"" jamboree. 

Sadly, it's an everyday struggle when it shouldn't be. If the mental wellbeing of that little girl and other dark skinned girls like her depended on me, I would do anything to save them all.

Just the confessions of a black girl who had to build herself up again to realize all of this.**
----------------------------------------------------

I'll start off with a little disclaimer: I have had a co-occurring anxiety disorder and moderate depression since I was about the age of 10. I am 23. I have been in therapy at least three times and have had taken anti-depressants for my anxiety on two separate occasions. I work in the mental health and substance abuse field, and it always comes to my attention how these subjects are somewhat ""taboo"" in our culture. Whether due to repressed cultural issues, PTSD, or simply being raised with an attitude that we cannot allow ourselves to breakdown, we have been raised to be ""survivors."" The truth is, at least for me, this attitude only further exacerbated my own mental illness. 

I grew up with a single mother who was in the army and my older brother. My mother comes from a southern family and she only has brothers. My own brother who is like an older male version of me went into the military when I was 9 (he is 8 years my senior). That left just me and my mother, and my mother, probably due to the large male influence in her family, her time in the military, and her own personal issues, raised me to be independent and not to fall apart over the smallest issues. But with that said, my mother rarely hugged me or comforted me when I needed it. Her responses were to ""suck it up,"" ""It's not the end of the world,"" ""Deal with it,"" ""You're too old for that,"" among other things. Basically, she had her best intentions, but at the end of the day, it wasn't okay to cry.

I may have always been susceptible to anxiety problems, but I first noticed something wasn't ""right"" around the time my brother left for the military. I remember being worried because it meant I would be left alone with mom and I didn't want to cross her ever. My mother is tough. It's her way or no way. Any time I wanted to argue, whether my thoughts were valid, it was seen as disobedience. Eventually I stopped talking back, and if there were issues, I just let her get on me rather than say anything back to her. In the household, mother is essentially God, especially in a black household. 

I began to notice how depressed I was around the age of 13. I was unhappy with my body, my clothes, my hair; I couldn't make friends that well. I was painfully shy and quiet, and I was hyper-aware of everything I did. I was also a very smart, very bookish kind of person. Not always the type to tough it out in situations that didn't involve a test or answering questions. My mother mistook my sadness for general angst and me just being a rebellious teen. I never knew how to tell her that it was much more than that. At 14, during an argument, I made my first comment about not caring whether I lived or died. I was near suicidal.

Not being able to really open up to my mother had a much harder effect on me than I had ever realized. My anxiety persisted for many years, making middle school, highschool, and the first couple of years away at college difficult for me. It wasn't until my junior year of college that I finally acknowledged my need for help. I felt too nervous to divulge to friends or family about my problems, but my college counseling center was one of the best decisions I could have made for myself. 

Most of my therapy involved talking about my mother and my relationship with her. I've been in and out of therapy, and eventually I began to understand how my sometimes volatile relationship with my mother, the mental toughness that I could never quite adopt, and just my own chemical imbalances, got me to this point. I missed out on a lot of growing up because of it.

Since then, I've made so much progress and cannot express the joy I feel with not having to wake up with my heart racing and this feeling of dread that my whole world is going to collapse whether there is a problem or not. 

Last night, my boyfriend said something to me that I will never forget.I've been having a miserable week, and one of the things I do whenever I vent about how I'm feeling is apologize profusely for even feeling sad or complaining about it. This is a residual thing from growing up at home where my mother always made me feel like it was my fault I was having problems, that I needed to ""step up,"" so to speak. I began to break down to my boyfriend over texts, apologizing in between, and breaking down further. He told me he was sorry that I felt so awful, and I eventually said ""I'm sorry too."" He then said to me ""You don't have to be sorry for anything. It's okay to be sad."" It was one of the single most important things I had ever heard in my life, and something my mother had never said to me but wish she had. I immediately stopped crying, I calmed down, and I went about my day with a pep in my step. It was okay to be human, it was okay to feel.

After reading a thread about how ""Sistahs need Sistahs too,"" I wanted to really nail that down. You do need someone sometimes. It's okay to cry. We don't always have to be tough. We're human. When I am ready for a family and children, I'm going to hug them every day. I'm going to let them cry. I'm going to let them do what they want. But most of all, I'm going to tell them that it's okay.

96,,A revelation: The cause of my depression and low self esteem stems from my parents,13,ruho46,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/ruho46/a_revelation_the_cause_of_my_depression_and_low/,6,"This might be long but I am hoping to see if other people can relate. 2021 didn’t go as planned after I graduated unfortunately I was in a car crash and became extremely broke due to the incident. My post-grad plans of going to Spain changed and I ended up going back home. My relationship with my parents is practically non -existent. All my life my parents only cared about school and for their children becoming a doctor. So summer 2021 I went back to my depressing room and my parents. They were upset that I didn’t go to medical school and I told them I want to purse optometry (this was mainly due to my grades and also having the doctor title for them mainly). So that was my plan, until a wave of depression hit me. I have always had some sort of depression since moving to America from England at the age of 11. I moved to a shitty state with no friends or family around and I felt unloved. 

After getting diagnosed with depression in the fall I started therapy. I always though therapy was for suicidal white girls but its not. Talking to my therapist I was able to breakdown what is causing my depression. It wasn’t a one time incident, but it was a collection of negative thoughts and ideologies that have accumulated over the years leading me to my breaking point.

my therapist told me explain my emotions and I automatically said I have none. I think this maybe due to the fact I never had a space at home to show my emotions. I could never have talked to my mother about how I feel about something because she would automatically blame me or criticize me. Like honestly God forbid, I could get SA-ed and my mum would find a way to blame it on me. My dad only cared about education, work and church. My mum is extremely self-centered and loves to criticize/complain about everything. To be honest they don’t really love each other. The only reason they’re together is because they’re pastors and they have to maintain that relationship for the other church members. So yeah, I didn’t grow up in a loving household, I don’t know what I loving relationship is and I never learned how to express my emotions. 

With this little backstory of myself, these 3 concepts are the “building blocks” of my depression:

**My weight/self esteem** 

I have always been overweight as a kid but I wouldn’t be classified as obese until now. I didn’t want to move to America but I had no choice. I struggled a lot mentally and then this led to me gaining 140 pounds over the span on 9 years. Being the only girl in the house, my mum has always critiqued me more than my brothers. She would always complain about the way I dress, she would call me all types of fat names in Yoruba (and she’s fat her self) and she would complain about everything I did: this includes washing dishes, brushing the floors and cooking etc. She would complain that I am lazy and that no man would want to marry a lazy fat woman like “myself”. I just kept taking this in for so many years. And the fact is I just internalized it and started making those words my reality. My subconscious accepted the fact that “I will always be fat and that I am unattractive to any man”. Looking back now at my life I have also noticed how much I have criticized my life, my looks and wellbeing. Hey maybe that’s why I stayed fat so that I have something to critique myself about. Quite literally all my life I have battling with my weight and every fucking year I would say I am going to lose the weight. Some years I lost some weight but that didn’t last long. I eventually weighed over 300 pounds in 2019. Alongside with this. I had no self esteem/ confidence (you guys can guess where this came from). I my therapist straight up that I have no self respect for myself, I hate my self, I hate the way I look, I am ugly, I can’t do this or that etc. I have now realized where that all came from…My mother. It sad to see that our mothers/aunts have these traumas from being a woman and they then project their own insecurities and problems to the younger girls/women. Like that’s so fucked up. From a young age my mind /subconscious was programmed to “I will always be fat” “I am unattractive” “No man will ever love me”etc and this is the time where my mind is developing. I cant blame my mother for putting the food directly in my mouth to the point I gained so much weight but my upbringing truly wrote the blueprint for me being obese and having low self esteem. 

And its so funny because today before church, my mum was literally complaining about me sitting on the dining table in silence. LIKE PURE FUCKING SILENCE. Like ma’am, I am just sitting here on my phone I am not disturbing you in any sort of way. And that’s where it all clicked for me. The critiques of my mother really led to me having low self esteem. And that led to me thinking I will always be fat and that I will never desired. 

I am happy to say that I am on my weight loss/self love journey and that I have been making good progress so far. It’s hard for me to accept that I have lost a lot of weight but I am proud that I am taking control and learning to respect and love myself. 

**Fear of success** 

Just like any stereotypical immigrant parents. They want you to be either a doctor or lawyer. My dad pushed the doctor concept on the three of us (my brothers and I). My older brothers pursed other career and it was easier for them because at that time my dad was living in America and the rest of us in England. So my dad moved from England to America because he liked the fact everything is bigger and that he could make more money here. So when my mother and I moved to America, my dad always pushed medicine down my throat. He told me to focus on my science classes and to forget about the other classes like art and history which looking back I enjoyed more than the science. My dad enrolled me into a stem-based/ pre-health high school (it was ghetto) and he expected me to be on the top of my class so that I get into a good university. And I did quite well in high school I was in the top 20, I was on the honor roll and in the national honors society. College came around and my dad said that he will pay for my college so I am over here like yeah that’s lit. When it comes to these African parents they will want something in return and that was for me to go to medical school. I majored in biology and I struggled. Like I struggled so much in my science classes, my grades were mainly Bs with Cs and barely any As. Well the reason behind it, I didn’t like it but I was scared to switch my major to something else because my dad was paying for my degree. I was scared of what he would say if I told I wanted to major in something else that wasn’t stem. So I literally suffered throughout college and this affected my self esteem a lot. I knew I was capable of getting good grades but this major wasn’t for me. looking back at my transcript, I did SOOO FUCKING WELL IN MY NON-STEM AND SPANISH courses. And I was fucking passionate about it and I truly enjoyed them but again I was fearful of what my dad would say. Its senior year and I tell my dad I don’t want to apply to medical school , that I wanted to apply to optometry school instead and HE WAS FUCKING PISSED OFF. Like can you imagine…your daughter said she wants to be an optometrist instead of a medical doctor. He started shouting at me saying some shit like He’s going to send me to the medical schools in Jamaica like his best friend did with their kids. And I am proud of myself that I actually stood my ground against him and told him no I am not going to medical school. He loosened up and accepted it. So during 2021 and everything that happened to me in summer I became depressed and lost interest in optometry. My parents kept on asking me about updates about my studying and applications and I just continued lying to their faces. I tanked the entrance exam and weirdly….I felt good 🤣. Like it was the perfect reason for me to look into what I am actually passionate about. My dad was upset and he doesn’t want me to spend another gap year working because he thinks I am going to forget how to study or not go back to school. He then was telling me I should go to nursing school and I said no I don’t want to be a nurse. We kept on going back forth and I said okay ill look into it(fuck that shit I am not going to nursing school). So that’s where I am right now. 

I was so scared of what my parents would say about my career choice so that’s why when I noticed my grades weren’t good enough for medical school I switched to being pre-opt. But looking back at it, I only “switched” because I still wanted to impress them and let them talk about how their daughter is a doctor. One thing my brother told was no matter what you do with your life, African parents will complain . And that has been one of my mantras. Just like how my mother was complaining about me sitting in silence and not interacting with her, she will find a way to complain about something. At the end of the day as long as I make money and I enjoy what I am doing, **that is my own definition of success**. 

**Concept of love and emotions** 

I didn’t grow in a household were emotions were accepted. Anytime my mum would cry about something my dad would tell her to just go to her room and do it there. My dad, completely emotionless and my mum hides her emotions about the things he does and until she randomly explodes and curses him out. Anytime something bothers my mum about my dad she would come to me and complain and she would never express her emotions to my dad and would be passive aggressive . And to be quite frank, my dad didn’t/doesn’t give a shit. So children observe their parents and adapt their actions right? That’s what happened to me. I would call myself emotionless and I would feel uncomfortable when my friends would cry etc. I have never cried in front of my friends, until recently and it felt good to get it off my chest. I saw being emotional as being weak and burdensome on the other person that’s why I always would wait to cry in my room and not talk about it. I was talking to my therapist and she asked me how do I express my emotions and I said I don’t have any emotions. She continued to analyze me and she told me due to me not expressing my emotions she can tell I am passive aggressive to other individuals. JUST LIKE MY FUCKING MOTHER LOL. My dad doesn’t make it any better for her and my mum has mentally checked out of the relationship and is only with him to show face. I have never seen my parents kiss, or hold hands or at least express love in other ways. They’re literally roommates in a house and they have separate rooms. My biggest fear would be to end up in a situation where my mum is and to be in a loveless marriage. I don’t want to be with someone just to be with someone like most of these African aunts be like. I am lucky that I realized that I need to work on emotions at this age instead of me being 35 with kids. I have never been in a relationship because I have always had low self-esteem, I see the way my mother is in their relationship and I think that really turned me off on dating and getting married. But this of course is not true for all relationships. But I hope that this year I will put myself out there and start dating ☺️

Looking back at all these 3 concepts they have led me to feel the way that I do. I guess the first step of recovery is acceptance and I have accepted that these three reasons are why I am depressed, have low self-esteem and overall not living my best life. Me moving back home really just emphasized this hence why I am experiencing this right now. It’s crazy to think that some of these incidents would be considered a type of trauma that has impacted my life and the way I view myself. I am proud of myself that I am in therapy and I am learning more about myself. I am proud that I am able to identify these concepts that I have been battling my whole life and I am happy that I found the root cause of my problems. I do think my parents mean well, but the way they express themselves counteracts their words. I know they won’t change because it has been programmed into their minds and that they don’t see this as a problem. But I can say I am taking the steps to break this cycle. I want my future children to develop confidence and self respect from when they are young. I want my children to know that me as their mother I would always love them and support them for their future desires, passions and plans. I want to be in a loving relationship with a man who has emotional intelligence, who is someone caring and supportive and a fun time to be with. I plan on saving money and moving out of this sad house. I realized for me, I think its best I distance myself from them and start living my own life the way I want to live it. 

I know this is long as hell but I would love to hear y’all feedback and comments. Do you guys relate or maybe see similar patterns? I truly believe everyone should look into therapy as you can learn a lot more about yourself and the way you view your life!",1641152936.0,suicide

98,,Advice - Househare Conundrum,1,x6co8v,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/x6co8v/advice_househare_conundrum/,0,"Don't really know who to talk to about this, so I figured why not bring it to Reddit?

I (25f, bi-sexual) live in a UK houseshare that has been 3 yt girls, 1 yt boy and myself.

Two of the yt girls are moving out now and being replaced by another yt girl and yt boy that were picked by the last of the three girls left over - I'll call her Molly (27) & the other two Kelly (23) and Jane (21). We lived in this house for 6 months and our rent continues on a rolling basis from this month. Kelly is moving down the road to start her life with her new baby and Jane is moving back home to a different county.

When we first moved in, everyone was mad friendly. Molly especially she's the type to get to know the neighbours and try to be as involved in everyone's life as possible. In the beginning, this wasn't a problem. Chalked it as Molly is an extrovert though she claims otherwise. She would offer to pick me up from uni, ask if I want to go to the gym with her. normal friendly stuff.

Kelly is more like me, reserved unless around her mates - has her moments of extroversion. Jane is very extroverted and has a busy schedule that could be 3 days on three days off (in the beginning, she rarely had off times, to be honest).

Also, other than Jane and the guy (I'll call him John (23)) we are mostly always home. Everyone's employed, Molly, John, myself have hybrid type jobs.

To put it plainly, within a month of living here the vibes in this house became very weird - I have some fault in it but I'm wondering now if I have been hard on myself.

Whenever we socialise, and Molly is present, everything I say is met with some kind of subtle resistance. I'll give three examples;

\- Conversation about travel: I talk about how my passport only allows me to travel to 40 countries visa-free. Molly, who has a passport that allows her to travel to 191 countries visa-free, says that the situation with my passport is not that bad and then suddenly everyone present (think it was just John, tbh) chimes in with the same opinion. Also, we were discussing Cristiano Ronaldo, who I incorrectly assumed was from Brazil, which she corrected while tacking on that mixing up his nationality is the same as if she assumed I was from another African country than the one I am from (which idk, maybe she's right but it just seemed unnecessary

\- Molly would consistent speak to me in a borderline depreciating/rude way and then immediately say, ""I'm just winding you up"" - Jane noticed this as well, said a similar thing happens with her (more on this later)

\- When the house went out the first time, John, Molly and I were in a conversation about our types, and when John asked me before I could get a word out, Molly immediately tells him that he is. (She knows this because I said it to the girls when we were gushing about how attractive he is).

The thing is, I kept letting things go cause I'm an asshole and can be a bit unaware. When we discussed John's attractiveness within 2 weeks of my moving in, Molly mentioned he has a girlfriend, and I kept joking about how I'd still hit that. This was my fuck up cause shortly after, I learned Molly was going through a divorce because she was cheated on. I felt bad and decided to apologise when the time was right. in the meantime, I asked if my jokes were triggering to her and told her I was willing to stop.

\*tangent\*

I asked because I personally do not like when people change how they act around me because I'm going through things. It makes me feel like a victim, and I'd rather not. Molly, to this point, had also presented herself in a similar way though hindsight shows she was just mirroring me Also, I'm pretty emotionally numb and dealt with depression and suicidal ideations for the majority of my adult life, so cheating is not something I have been able to naturally capture the gravity of. These aren't excuses, I am actively working on these things.

\*tangent\*

Anyway, I asked, she made a show of thinking about it and then said no, the jokes don't actually bother her, and I believed her. So the next time she brought John up and his attractiveness was being discussed, my contribution, as usual, was that I'd hit that. This time though, I watched her reaction carefully, and it felt forced, so I decided to drop it. At this point, though, the energy was already feeling negative. She had withdrawn from me (which was fair), and her ""wind-ups"" had increased. At the time, I was in a long-distance open relationship and got quite a few dates off tinder, and I felt okay being open and honest about this because Kelly had an onlyfans and the conversations around sex did not feel judgemental. And honestly, I really checked for judgemental reactions in the beginning because Molly is a Mormon who either took a break from or completely pulled away from the religion last December and all the signs I know to be aware of were not visible at that time. But then suddenly, the ""wind-ups"" became related to my sex life. Eye rolls when I'm talking about a date I've been on. In a harmless ""what animal would you be"" conversation, Molly says Koala for me because they have chlamydia. We enter the realm of borderline slut shaming.

This is where I'm at a crossroads cause, in my head, I've triggered this lady, and she's processing a lot of emotions. I just need to be patient with her, and then we can have a conversation to clear the air and at least find civil ground. I don't love her behaviour, and she's not someone I'd particularly want to be close to, but we live together and I'd rather have peace in my home. So I focus on her positives, try to change a ""wind up"" conversation to one where compliments are being shared. I do everything I can to diffuse the situation.

One of the things I do is finally take Molly up on her offer to go to the gym (I hate the gym). We go, and it's honestly an okay day. Then on the drive back home, she says how in her culture, people are direct, and I'm ecstatic cause this whole British passive-politeness thing was honestly really irritating me as much as it was the right and respectful thing to do in this situation. So I send her a message the next day and say, based on our convo, I would really like to clear the air when she has the time.

I find out later that she told Kelly & Jane (who told John) and had called up a friend to wait in her room ""just in case?"". I also find out that Jane had shared my conversations with her about the situation (which only happened because Jane identified the situation)

During the conversation, I affirm that I believe I may have made her feel uncomfortable and would like to apologise if that was the case. I tell her I think the energy between us is off because of the above reason, and it manifests in her ""wind-ups"". She denies that was the case while throwing a rant of an aside that she still thinks cheating is disrespectful etc., but she understands we are different people based on the details of my relationship at the time, and while she's not a judgemental person, we are just different people who can get along, but it's not like we are going to be best friends or anything. But like everything is fine, she has no negative emotions towards me we can still chat around the kitchen etc. She says she knows I can't take the wind-ups, so she'll stop but yeah, no bad vibes. However, she also noted that I'm apparently draining and everyone but John knows it and the only reason John doesn't is because he's a clueless man (paraphrased). She sites an example of how when we chill in the garden in the evening after I've had a long day of uni or work at my part-time job or both, I get quiet and then shortly after leaving to go lay down in my room. She used that example and suggested that my being up and full of energy in the earlier parts of the day and then down later in the day is evidence of emotional instability. Also, apparently, I don't know myself very well because she wanted to call me an emotional person during a conversation in the kitchen, and I'm like, lol, I deffs am not (for context, along with the mental health issues mentioned earlier I am doing a masters degree at a top uni, work part-time to pay my rent and bills and up until recently had been having issues with getting my tuition fully paid and yet was still able to go on with my days as normal with no drama until this and I have never had a public emotional outburst)

In other words, she wasn't trying to achieve a resolution and seized the opportunity to completely belittle me in the most ""polite"" way possible.

I left that conversation concluding that she definitely had no liking for me, which honestly is okay. What really was doing my head in is the behaviour that followed not just from her but also everyone else except John, who checked in on me and honestly had been pretty solid. I wouldn't say we are friends, but if I need something and he can help, he will and vice versa.

First, we have Jane's behaviour. Already I've found out she's not very trustworthy, but she's young, and again, these people aren't really the kind of people I'd be friends with outside of our living situation. I talk to Jane about the conversation, and she tries to get me to understand molly's POV. Which I mean, from what I've written so far it's clear I do. There wasn't much understanding reserved for me and from that point I knew whatever I said to her would go back to Molly. But she kept playing friends with me. Would invite me to go home and party with her, would act all nice etc when its just me and her etc. She was having an emotional moment one day and came to my room and invited Molly to come to. I didn't want drama, so I let it slide and Molly was already inside before I realised jane has texted her to come give advice. The dynamic was always, overfriendliness from Jane when Molly is away, Molly comes back and the air gets icy. The last straw was a few weeks ago. I had left for London for the weekend. Before I did, it was just me Jane and Kely and everything was solid, we went shopping together, had good conversation etc. I return and bruh, Molly is back and so is the ice.

Similar with Kelly, but less. I respect Kelly, she has not given any illusion that we are friends, but until this same weekend, she never gave any hints that we were unfriendly. She's invited me to her baby shower, we'd occasionally talk about how similar we are in that we like our own company. And we both smoke, so it was one of the few ways that we could chill. Plus, the onlyfans thing was cool as well, and we could talk about that. But after my London trip, pure ice. Usually, we at least say hi to each other with a smile, but that did not happen. I don't always chill with everyone except Jane is around cause out of the three, she was the closes thing to what I would call a friend, so when she was back home after my trip, everyone, including myself (there's a reason) went to chill in her room, and as I walk in, Kelly goes ""oh are you in a better mood now"". Mind you, my London trip was a break from my dissertation, which I had thrown myself back into once I returned, so everyone had seen much less of me. Everyone knew this would be the case as well because I had said so. When they do see me, it's when I step down for food or tea, but I limit conversation because I have to stay focused, which I have explained before. Anyway, I don't engage and instead point out that she had looked away earlier when I said hi to her, to which she had ""oh"" as a response.

The thing is, IDK if Kelly has gone to uni, I give her that grace; maybe she doesn't understand the stress. Jane hasn't gone to uni, but I give her less grace cause literally just text me if you think something is up. I give Molly no grace. Not only has she gone to uni, she's done the exact same course as me but at the BSc level - but still.

I actually tried moving on from the drama with Molly around the start of the summer. My long-distance relationship had reached its end (it was more stressful than it was beneficial to me, considering all I'm dealing with), and I just needed to pull something off my plate to stay calm. Molly likes to mother people, and I suspected telling her my relationship was done would make her feel better, so I shared, and we were back on friendlier terms. Then I find out that the week following, she had told John that I had a crush on him which honestly blew my mind cause why? It didn't change anything with John and me, and he knows I don't get on with Molly. Still just, why?

There's so much more, but this is long enough. I guess I wanted to rant and also just see what people think. Do I deserve this shit? Should I expect more drama with the new additions to the house? The house is mad lovely and cheap, so I'm not trying to move - what advice would you give me on coping in a less passive but non-aggressive way? My course is coming to an end, and I'll be legally able to work and earn full-time in a couple of weeks, so a bulk of the stresses that drove my passivity are leaving the station. But I don't want to get into a thing with anyone. It's not my vibe, and I can't fight.

TLDR; I pissed off my Mormon yt recently cheated on housemate with jokes about cheating, tried to apologise and get things civil, but she wouldn't even admit there's a problem. A lot of passive-aggressive nonsense has occurred, and I've been played by the housemate I thought I was friends with. Do I deserve this? What advice would you give me on navigating this in the future? I fully recognise the part I played in the origins of this, but IDK, it seems like a lot of drama stemming from basically nothing at the same time.",1662373039.0,suicide

Yesterday, I was feeling great. Spirits were high, my mood was stable, and I was genuinely happy with zero anxiety. Then, around like 10:45-11:00 pm I had barely half a cutwater.

That's when I left. At the time I was 19 with very low self esteem. The second relationship was also very bad. The guy was a full blown narcissist. He did everything from lying to gaslighting to love bombing then eventually he discarded me. I did everything I could to keep the relationship going but in the end nothing was good enough he still cheated. Coming out of that relationship made me really stop and take a look at myself. I really had to ask why on earth does this keep happening and why do I stay with these people. After doing some reading online I found that I'm a bit of a push over with very low self esteem.

Unfortunately, being stressed out all the time has started to really take a toll on me physically. I've lost almost 10 pounds, which would be fine if I wasn't already underweight. My hair is starting to suffer as a result, and it is now noticeably thinner and shorter. 

I'm really not sure what to do. I'm tempted to cut my hair and start over, but I'm afraid I'll regret it as I was really proud of my hair length before it started breaking off. I've been wearing a wig I really like more often, but I know I won't be able to do that forever.

I'm a 30 year old black woman and I... am depressed. I don't know if anyone wants to hear the whole story, but to keep it short: I've hated myself since I was a little girl and realized how differently pretty much everyone treated me as the only little black girl in a gifted class. I struggled with self-image, eating disorders, self-harm, etc, made it into a good university where I was finally able to seek therapy, which helped a bit. Eventually escaped the country (America), lived abroad for about 4 years in a country where I had to pay into health care (dirty socialists booo), didn't improve with just the change of scenery and lifestyle, so I went to a therapist there who just GOT ME. She was like...heaven-sent. The therapy wasn't paid for by heath insurance, but going to the psych was, so that was tremendously helpful. Had to come back to dear America last year, but I thought it'd be okay, since I have all this experience and skills and woo~! I survived a difficult life on the other side of Earth COME GET ME AMERICA!!! 

But now, I am fat, tired, achy, can't take care of my sick parents, can't afford health insurance despite having a job (I only work inconsistent freelance + part-time for them, and I actually love the work I do so I don't want to quit), see people left and right be given positions I myself could do over me... and I'm just so. tired. I get severe stomach aches almost every night. My skin is a disaster zone. I tried to join kickboxing, but I was too exhausted to make it most of the time. I am so tired all of the time. I'd like to eventually get married, start a family, have my own place (living with my parents now), but I'm just... not attractive. And I seem to be the only one that thinks I'd be a great catch despite my face and flub ahahaha. 

I feel like this has been my life for the past 25+ years that I can remember. Struggling...and then watching everyone else attain what I've been pushing myself for. I'm so tired. If this is how it's going to be, I refuse to keep going. I have made my exit and everything already.  I told myself I'd give it 6 or 7 more years to try to get it together, but... nah. I don't think I can do 6 or 7 more years of this.  

I'm one of three, middle child and only girl, my brothers are both married and dealing with their own stuff, my dad has dementia but it doesn't matter because he never cared anyways, and my mom is my only support, but she's a breast cancer survivor so busy dealing with her health and my dad (whom it's no secret to anyone that she pretty much hates) and her friends' health, and working when she can, I feel bad bothering her too much. Plus, she doesn't quite get it. She's very religious and very West Indian, so though she denies it, I still suspect the she thinks I can ""pray it away."" 

I finally started seeing a therapist here after thinking I could fix it on my own for so long, but my next appointment isn't until Friday. Maybe I should try to move it up to Wednesday-ish. I might lose my job tomorrow.  Well then I can make it Tuesday yaayy. 

What I would like advice on is for those of you (especially black ladies, but of course I want to hear everyone's story) that have fought depression as a working adult and won, or are currently fighting depression, how did you do it/ how are you doing it? 

Or, did anyone decide to start over? How did you do it? Like had a radical hairstyle/shoe style/lifestyle change and now you are simply happy about the fact that you breathe?

I am extremely depressed and if feels like no matter what I do I'll always feel this way. When you have the media constantly telling you how ugly, disgusting, and undesirable you are it takes its toll. There are people like tommy sotomayor who make a living slandering black women and preaching to the masses why we don't deserve to be treated like human beings. If you go on twitter and search 'black women' you'll find tweet after tweet of people making fun of us and attacking us for no reason. Watch tv and look at the hair commercials. The hair that looks most like ours is the kind that the shampoo is supposed to fix because it's unacceptable. The way black women are shown in movies is so stereotypical and negative. It's everywhere. I don't understand why we can't be shown in a positive light, why we have to believe were ugly, why everybody has to shit on us every chance they get. What did we ever do to anybody? 

And dating is even worse. Black men treat black women like absolute trash but expect us to be loyal and put up with it. Why do we have to put up with their abuse? Yes I said abuse. People in the black community can sit and criticize us all day but nobody ever talks about black men and what they're doing wrong.  Why aren't they out in the streets marching for us when one of us is wrongfully killed? Why are they silent about our mistreatment, yet were supposed to speak out about theirs? Why do they make video after video bashing us on YouTube when we'd defend them when anyone says anything bad about them? Why is it ok for them to be obsessed with white women but when we get sick of their shit and want to date outside of our race, were traitors? Nobody wants us to be happy. Black men want us to lift them up and sit quietly and cater to them while they mistreat us. I'm over it. 100% over it. 

I'm over white people and their racist bullshit and constant silencing tactics whenever they get called out. I'm over the media and our misrepresentation. We are not hair weaves and rolling necks and bad attitudes. We have hobbies and interests just like the rest of the fucking world. We are not stupid. Black women currently make up the highest percentages of college enrolled students(google it) yet the world wants to act like we are ignorant uneducated wild animals.

I am a first generation college student and It has been a long road for me because I took so many breaks due to my mental health and lack of motivation. Every day I wonder why I am even still in college and  if it will even be worth it in the end. I am trying so hard to finish so that I can make my family proud but I keep slipping. I often feel like I am all alone when I am on campus. It is a private school and I am constantly surrounded by a sea of wealthy white kids and wealthy professors that i have zero in common with and who don't understand me or don't want to hear my voice. 

I don't really have anyone cheering me on or encouraging me, besides my parents who don't exactly encourage me but instead badger me with constant questions about when I'm going to graduate so they can brag to their friends. sometimes I feel like maybe I don't belong in university and going to college was the wrong decision for me. But then I think about the importance of having a degree as an black woman and it's pretty much the only thing keeping me going. Without some sort of degree i know that my chances of getting a good paying job are slim to none. 

When I think about how much debt I'm going to be in and the fact that even though I will have a degree I will more than likely still deal with discrimination during job searches, it makes me want to give up and drop out. I have been doing research on unemployment rates of black college grads and they are pretty high.

Since I have been in college for so long i have seriously come to realize that universities are racist institutions and they always will be. They merely tolerate our presence there because of things like affirmative action, and the fact that we would add some diversity to the student body which makes them look good. The lack of support for poc, especially poor poc once you're actually there is horrible. I do not feel as though I have learned anything of value. The most important things I have leaned as a young adult are things I've learned from reading blogs online and educating myself. My biggest regret is not going going to an hbcu. I feel like my experience would have been much different. 

I made this post because I felt like there had to be other young women like me who have had similar experiences. I originally posted this in askreddit but got very few responses.

In every job I've had I have had this habit where something comes over me and I don't go in. A couple of jobs ago, I remember one particular incident where I was off for a week and it spiralled to the point where my boss was leaving concerned voicemails because I'd not rang for a couple of days. I ended up walking around *near* the office building (I live 10 minutes walk from there) and crying my eyes out on the street to my best friend who had no idea what to do with me. That was probably the last time I allowed myself to suspect depression and that was about 3 years ago, although that was not the last time I skipped work.

I don't do anything on these days off, out of guilt. I sit at home in my pyjamas. Maybe watch some tv. Currently I have a churn going at the pit of my belly, thinking of all the meetings I've missed. The whispering. The inevitable conversation I'm going to have with my manager when I do go back. My God I hate return-to-work interviews. They are so disingenuous.

I don't even think it's a work problem. I've had bouts of not wanting to turn up to something since I was at school, and that was 10 years ago. I just didn't realise it wouldn't go away.

I have no idea what's wrong with me. Why would a 26 year old who by most standards is doing OK (considering what I can be like, I acknowledge that I get through life with a combination of applying almost self sacrificial charm and brute hard work/pulling out all the stops my brain can muster) feel like this? There isn't anyone I can talk to mainly because as soon as I try to talk, my problems sound stupid and are by and large, self inflicted. Lord knows I've tried to break this habit. I don't know what its root cause is though, which is where my brick wall hits. There isn't a big therapy culture over here and the one or 2 times I tried to explore depression/stress with my GP,  the conversation went nowhere. 

Does this sound familiar to any of you? Maybe I just need a big reality check.",1444230609.0,depression

He was honest about this on his dating profile and when we started going on dates irl. My issue isn’t with him smoking, as I do socially or after work here and there, but more so the frequency and whether he’s high or not while we’re spending quality time together. 

To provide some examples, he always suggests we smoke before going into a movie (to the point that we missed the beginning of a movie I was really excited to see). He even suggested we smoke before going into the museum for our anniversary. Last weekend we went to a horror nights event and I left my pen in the car. While in the park, he asked me why I didn’t bring it in (I thought it wasn’t allowed) and said he didn’t say anything earlier because he didn’t want to “seem like a fiend”. Whenever we hang out we end up “taking a walk” or smoking on the porch. The other day I spent the night and he used my pen before going to sleep and as soon as he woke up.

It’s possible his attitude towards 🍃may be a result of his upbringing. His parents are veterans and at a recent family gathering he shared a blunt with his dad and cousin. He’s also told me multiple times that his mom gives him edibles when he visits her.

He never forces me to participate and I really don’t mind sharing my stuff with him, sometimes it can be fun to be high together. However, his behavior does worry me in general but also makes me nervous that he feels like he needs to be high  we’re together (almost like that’s the only way he can handle hanging out with me).

So I went to Brazil for Carnival a few months ago. It was my dream for over 5 years to travel there... Welp, while I did make some great, unforgettable memories, I was really disappointed with how I was treated as a black person. 1st of all, there were not as many black folks/afro brazilians as I thought there'd be. For context, I was in Rio De Janeiro and in terms of amount of black people, it remined me of Los Angeles. Honestly though... this was my fault because I should have done more research.. Going to Bahia probably would have been better.

2, the way so many men COMPLETELY overlooked me and flocked to my white-passing friend I was traveling with was so... 🙃... I felt like I was in college again as the only black friend in the group being ignored for all of my other friends. \*sigh... again, this is my fault. I kind of built Brazil up in my mind to be this mecca for folks from the African diaspora. It has the biggest population of Africans outside of Africa and so much of Brazil's culture comes from African influences. But fuck...

Around the beginning of July of this year, i was told “hey give keratin a try, it keeps your hair healthy and easy to maintain ( my depression was getting worse and i was starting to revert back to not caring for my hair) I DID THE TREATMENT AND THE LADY BURNT MY ENTIRE SCALP. like when she was done, my hair was so stuck to my scalp. 2 days later i was scabbing severely, like my entire head. i couldn’t brush my hair without flakes because of the scabs and when i noticed it was scabs i stopped combing it. this really didn’t help with my anxiety and depression. i let it heal, i just oiled my scalp and and wrapped it hoped the oil would soften the scabs so it could go away on its own. it was SO bad. 


 afterwards my hair was definitely easy to manage (im sorry i don’t like the maintenance of curly hair) and i’d just blow dry it and it would be so quick. my hair was DEFINITELY growing too! 


to conclude, my hair isn’t hard to manage right now but i have some curly strands and some straight. it’s so weird, it kinda looks like heat damage tbh.

I always knew my mom was depressed, but I thought it was related to childhood issues that she didnt want to discuss. It also recently came out that she had an incurable Std due to his cheating. So the years of her being depressed made sense...she was miserable in her marriage.

I remember when my mom was dying I flew down to sit with her as she was sick. I remember my dad said to me ""Uh oh..you are out of town and your husband is alone"". I was so pissed bc 1. I married a good dude who Im not worried about cheating on me. 2. He doesnt even know my husband well, he has only met him twice and 3. Why would you say that to your child? Its cruel and unneccessary and my mother was sitting there dying at the time. Wtf. The entire comment threw me off bc at the time, it didnt make sense to me. Now I get why he said that: he was a trash.

I know this happened 10 years ago but he is visiting now and we had a couple of conversations about the past he starts talking about all these women he knows and ironically they all overlapp in the time period in which my mother was alive. I mean a lot of these women didnt even live in the same state as us. This was pre internet, so how the hell he even get to know all these women?

Ladies, if this has taught me one thing is that NEVER stay with a man who doesnt deserve you and especially cheats. Ive seen what happens to a woman who stays in a situation to where they are cheated on, even if it is for the kids. For YEARS I never knew why my mom carried such darkness with her. She was a good mom as she could of been but she had issues with alcohol in order to sleep every night. Every woman I know who has stayed in a cheating marriage either has destroyed themselves, destroyed their kids, or took it out on other women who were happy (no matter if the woman was married or single).

I do want to make this post not totally negative and say while my dad is a piece of absolute shit...there are men out there who are wonderful. My husband is a good dude and many of my friends are married to men who are amazing husbands and fathers. I am also doing my best in raising our son to be a responsible man one day.

241,,We are not a monolith,134,173iard,blackladies,https://i.redd.it/ha799tkyl3tb1.jpg,66,"There was a thread on this sub today on Dominican Salons and blow outs. OP had a great experience, and asked why people have said that Dominicans perm people’s hair without their knowledge, saying her mom said the same and asked if people had experienced this or if the belief was made up.  Her blowout was cute and I wanted to see if people had positive or negative experiences too.  

When people commented on their negative experiences (because you know that’s exactly what she asked for), she pretty much question their experiences further as if they were exaggerating or lying. I saw many comments confirming curl damage or perm horrors or antiblack behaviors, while other people had some good experiences with Dominican salons.

I commented after seeing a few of OPs replies, that OP didnt seem interested in hearing others out because she kept asking questions to have people to further validate the truth of their experience. The thread got ugly, a lot of name slinging and other choice words. But I had the rest of my day to enjoy, so we move! Haha

So imagine my surprise to see either OP or another commenter went out of their way to send me a “concern redditor message” while I was out and about. (I was at a chocolate festival/expo: it was amazing, then I had hotpot with friends.) 

Though its weird, a bit obsessive and a mockery of mental health resources. Ive noticed a trend this weekend. 

There was another thread on here that got deleted by a different OP; the topic  was on getting dms from married men and she lashed out at the commenters, with OP saying they were just a bunch of white men loving, Sexyy Red hating, not going to the beauty store self hating black women when they simply told her to block these men. 

Im disappointed by the trend of not giving space to other perspectives, lived opinions and experiences. And moreso by the quick dismissal of someones blackness just because they said something you dont like. 

Being black women, we share a richness and some overarching similarities.  But we are not a monolith. Even with people I dont agree with at the end of the day like Candace owens, she is still a black woman.

I've been depressed since last year. I didn't readily recognize it because I have bipolar 2 and it's not bipolar depression. Bipolar depression, for me at least, is painful. I was stuck. I was just existing. This time around it's gentler if that makes sense. I can get stuff done, I just don't have the energy to do so. I don't have the giveadamnability. I want to sit here in this space and do nothing. 

What I have noticed about this type of situational depression is that it's making me relive old trauma. I have...A LOT to say the least. A few days ago, 'Your mother abused you.' popped into my head. On one hand, I knew that, but I've never articulated that before. My mother did abuse me. Physically and mentally. I've never processed that. I've compartmentalized her. There is my mama, who I love. She's awesome. She's a fantastic grandmother to my kids. Being a grandmother brings her joy beyond measure. It's that mother I wished I grew up with all the time. Then there is Jay. I hate Jay. When people say, 'She did the best that she could.' I always think she should have tried harder. More and more memories of Jay are popping up. I've been in therapy before but never really addressed her before. 

I've been wanting to work out. To take my health in my hands. Guess what? I've failed. I'm type 2 diabetic. It runs in the family so I'm not stressed over it, but I've stopped doing what I was supposed to be doing. It doesn't help that I don't think I have the best endocrinologist. He told me I could stop checking my blood sugar. This is after he told me he only wanted me to check it once a day. I just...I have to go back to checking my sugars. I got my sugar levels down a good bit, but now they're right back to where they were. I haven't worked out all month. I know what to do I just don't care. 

I can't even take comfort in my faith anymore. I've been so disconnected from God. I want to improve it but I don't know how. I think my depression has something to do with it...at least that's what I'm telling myself. I could be wrong. I'm wrong about a lot of things. 

The only thing I know for certain is this: I have a wonderful husband. I have 2 amazing kids. I love them with everything I have. I want to be my best for them. 

I have a consultation with a therapist on Tuesday. She specializes in trauma. I hope I vibe with her. I didn't with the last therapist I sought out and gave up.

I can only speak for my family but my parents definitely sweeped his treatment under the rug. I hate how emotional abuse is easy to recognize when it’s done towards spouses or towards children from their parents, but when  it comes to siblings, it’s considered horseplay, or it’s just kids being kids.

Imagine If I was a child (they should be using YouTube kids, but we know some parents don't care) and I made a voice error or spelling error and ended up down the red pill rabbit hole. It was truly scary and I quickly got out of there. The same thing happened on Instagram and all I was doing was scroll!! My whole Instagram FYP is literally pastels! This is crazy. 

I literally had a dude tell me with straight confidence that he'd date rape me if I drank alcohol?! Then tried to play if off as a joke!

It's well known how few women of color especially are allowed to thrive in academia, journalism, law, careers with prestige or power. Hardly ever do we hear the behind the curtain stuff of how people are discarded, careers deaded, livelihoods stripped away though, and I think this is really critical to widely understand. It makes me want to scream reading this (like the author says, and she's surprisingly a WW), but I don't know what can be done and thought I'd search for collective action ideas. Anyone have suggestions or insights? 

It's at least satisfying as a really scathing takedown. This Boston law firm, Prince Lobel, helped a podcast company, PRX's white women management whitewash its driving out Black women journalists, helped a university justify unprecedented attacks on its Africana Studies department, and has a First Amendment group led by an anti-Critical Race Theory scholar. Some excerpts-

""Of course, I realize that this pattern, in which law firms descend upon media companies to [defend against allegations of racism and/or sexism](https://www.wnyc.org/story/investigation-harassment-nypr-finds/?utm_source=tw&utm_medium=spredfast&utm_content=sf87544532&utm_term=wnyc&sf87544532=1), [weaken their unions](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ny-times-lawyers-accidentally-send-private-strategy-memo-to-staff-union), [quell labor complaints](https://twitter.com/mplaceunion/status/1575600155427975168), etc., is common and outcomes are often predictable.""

""Not only are Prince Lobel partners overwhelmingly non-Black (and mostly white), but all Black partners at the firm are men. **There is not a single woman of color, who is also a partner, working at Prince Lobel today**.""

""So PRX hired Prince Lobel, a firm with only one WOC partner in the entire firm at the time, to lead an investigation into a Black woman’s claims that she was one of multiple Black women who had left an organization due to systemic racism. This feels preposterous — like a joke, or as a former PRX employee put it to me months ago, a farce.""",1675732756.0,depression

I went to being natural about 6 years ago and I don't hate it, well I definitely like it more than my relaxed hair. But the amount of time I spend on it is driving me crazy. 

I grew it out and then cut it so have an easier style to maintain and over time it really hasn't been much easier. Well, it is easier but still the time thing is getting to me.

I have tried a bunch of different products and found a few that I loved and my hair loved too. However I found those products I love so much don't actually love my body.
After my entire adult life my OB would tell me my period pains were normal and I was just exaggerated in my feelings. I thought she was right until I actually spoke to friends only to find this pain wasn't ment to be this bad. 
I got a new OB, and she's black so win win for me! Turns out I had fibroids. Bad ones. 

Now, I'm someone who lives in a rabbit hole and I found that a lot of the hair products that I have been using for most of my life have endocrine disruptors. So I threw it all out. 
I had to have surgery because they were so bad and painful and just getting worse. 

But since then I am just having issues finding products that I love and love with my hair. I have a few but overall it's taking a lot out of me to find things. Products are so expensive and the need for multiple different things is real. 

I got laid off last month, but start a new job soon. 

I really do love my hair, but I don't love the time. 
I did just shave it all off so I don't have much to complain about. 

I just want to love my hair all the time. I grew up in a mostly white area, and I think this society and upbringing has just made me feel like I can't love it the way I should. 
Sometimes when it's not doing what I want I feel ugly and I feel like I've been extremely depressed about it. Don't get me wrong it's not the only thing I have strong feelings for. I recent found I can't eat cheese or dairy anymore so that's been like me crying outside of cheese and ice cream dept at the grocery store but it doesn't make me feel ugly.

I started crying, of course. It is my last day of class today in my internship and I was happy about that. But now I am feeling like I'm going to spiral.

My significant other unfortunately deals with bipolar depression. I have rationalized already in my mind that this is part of that (they feel they cannot meet my emotional needs), but it still doesn't change the fact that there have been emotional rollercoasters for me throughout this relationship (specifically, me worrying about my significant other due to depressive symptoms and more than one hospitalization), and I feel to have been put through that, whether intentional or not, and then just essentially discarded would hurt me even *more*.

It took me TWENTY-EIGHT years to find someone who *actually* makes me feel loved and consistently shows me that through their actions, COMMUNICATES with me, sexually satisfies me, and is someone I can truly, clearly visualize a future with.

I find myself wondering if this was something they've been meaning to do for the last 8 or so months and just wanted to wait until I got done with some of the most grueling parts of training towards my career path.

I feel my heart breaking already. *And that is something that takes me a LONG TIME to recover from.* I'm talking *years*.

I don't want this to be happening. I am devastated, and there isn't anything I can do about it.

I vividly remember asking not to be hurt three years ago. I was told I would not be.



This relationship makes me very, very happy. I don't want it to end. I DON'T WANT anyone else.

I could never figure out how to date and meet someone who is NOT a narcissist, does not communicate, cheats, etc. I have always wound up not having any success when I made MANY efforts to date in the past.

Why the fuck does this always happen to me? People have told me many times over the years that I am very kind, generous, beautiful. Okay, then WHAT is the problem?!?! WHY do I always get broken up with?!?!

I know how I am in social situations, and made it a point to not have any expectations that this night would go well. 

The first thing that put me off was the way that my coworkers spent the whole night trying to get me to dance with one of my coworkers who has a crush on me. These people have been trying to pressure me into dating this guy since I started this job 8 months ago. I’ve hung out with him before and am positive that I’m not interested in anything more than a friendship with him. I’ve said this out loud and in very clear language to these people and yet they insist on pushing him on me. I should mention that he’s one of two black guys in my department, the other of which is lighter skinned and good-looking. It makes me feel very unheard and invisible and makes me wonder what these people must think of me to think I don’t deserve better than to date someone I’m not at all interested in or attracted to just because he’s the same color as me. I already have problems with serious lack of self worth and value, and shit like this makes me feel like I’m justified in not valuing myself. If people around me don’t think I deserve better, then maybe I don’t?

The next thing that really bothered me about this night was something that’s bothered me for a while now. Why is it when men dance with black women, they insist that we grind on them? More than once, with more than one guy, I’ll start dancing with him, then 30 seconds into the interaction he turns me around and presses his dick into my ass. I actually make it a point to turn around and try to dance with him face to face, and inevitably he’ll physically turn me around and make me assume the position. It’s gotten to the point where I’d rather dance by myself, and usually do. 

The last thing, the thing that really fucked me up (thanks btw if you’re still reading this, I know it’s long af but I need to get this off my chest). Is the fact that no matter how good I am, I will never be able to compete with non-black women. I know for a fact that I am a beautiful woman, gorgeous in fact, in my late twenties. I’m not saying this in a narcissistic way (oh but how I wish I had enough self love to be narcissistic). In fact it’s not even something I totally agree with; I only know because I’ve been told so repeatedly. I’ve had white women tell me I look like a model. I posted my selfie here a few months ago when everyone was posting them and it got gilded. I am far from ugly. Again, not bragging, these are relevant facts. 

One of the co-workers I went out with Saturday is a Korean-American woman in her thirties. She’s about average in looks, and slightly overweight. She’s a really sweet person, I like her a lot and don’t wish to put her down, but again, relevant facts. I know this is going to sound petty and jealous, but it really bothered me how much attention she got from the black men at this bar. They were dancing with her all night (face to face, no one made her assume the position) and she got several phone numbers. Meanwhile, I was either dancing by myself or being forced to simulate sex acts. And intellectually I understand that she was being just as objectified as I was, but still. What’s the point of having all of this beauty when I’m still going to be passed over for average women of other races every time? People tell me I’m beautiful but I have a hard time believing it because this type of thing has been happening to me my whole life. The non-black men who date me only do so when they have a fetish for black women. Black men don’t date me because they are always looking for someone light skinned or of a different race altogether. And I get the whole, “if he can’t value you, he doesn’t deserve you” thing. But what if that means I’m going to be perpetually alone because all of the guys who would be a match for me have been subjected to the same cultural conditioning that makes me doubt and devalue my own beauty and value as a member of society?

I’ve struggled my whole life with feelings of self hatred, and my whole life I’ve been told that it’s my fault for not digging deep down within to find my self worth. The more I move around in this world however, the more I realize that the outside world his has just as big a part to play as I have in my inability to value myself. How are you supposed to value yourself when everyone in your society is telling you not to? How are you supposed to find value in yourself when everyone around treats you like you’re worthless? What do I do differently to make people treat me like I’m worth something.

Fuck this was long, I should do a TL;DR

TL;DR I went for a night out with my coworkers and all I got was a reminder of how little I’m valued by society as a black woman. My self loathing and self esteem are at opposite extremes right now as a result and I’ve decided to post my experience here instead of go to therapy like I’m supposed to because reddit is free and therapy is prohibitively expensive.

Living with a sibling/relative experiencing mental health issues is really difficult. Depression doesn’t happen to an individual, it happens to the whole family system.


Still, I often find myself wondering, what if it were one of us girl relatives? Would we have all this “grace”, room and space to live out our situations? At what point would we be called to be strong? 


I have an uncle who lived with his mom, my grandmother, up to his 40s. No job ever, nothing. He only moved out when another man gave him a small job in another district, and now he’s married to a 15 yo. This is the eldest son of the house. 


So in my family, I feel like we all silently just accept that “men are like that”.

Nobody offered me help. I asked and nobody could be bothered. 

Last year they wanted to get my older brother out of their house (I’m 27 and he is 30) and the only way they though this could happen was moving both of my older brothers in to an apartment.

My parents bought all my other siblings multiple cars (5 of us total) but they refused when it came to me (i was the last to need a car) so I had to work and buy my own.
