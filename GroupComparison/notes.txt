Seems to me NN with and without treatment best to check similarity?
AND/OR ML kernel functions????

But statistics from visualization

Also I messed up earlier and was querying the same user data over and over again - and it did change - not by much but data might be slightly unreliable and/or changing. To this point, I reran and something judged statistically significant flipped.


RESULTS

Biggest differences

We saw 16% difference in total, 
bad event: with null hypothesis of they are from same distribution, the odds of seeing this result is less than 5% (assume they are same, odds that they are same are less than 5)

Questions
When combining sentiment - I normalized all to 0 (score = score - SUM(scores)/len(emotions)) - should I do this?
When combining sentiment over multiple posts I'm dividing by n. Should I do sqrt(n)? Important bc based on when we have data this n can be different 
Should I do some kind of outlier dropping?

tasks
incorporate stats into control/treat
pln: can specify want individual and timed fixed effect

Matching
isSuicidal if has word suicide in it
can be negative (ex: abuse)
