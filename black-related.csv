While I was rotating on inpatient adult units, I met daily with patients who would do things like constantly falsify new symptoms in an attempt to get medications I could not ethically prescribe them and make completely unrealistic demands of me and the rest of the team on a daily basis. I'm talking things like, ""I need you to personally find me a therapist who is a black man and who I can afford and who has appointments after 6 pm and if you don't find me this, it will be your fault I don't get better"" and ""I want you to find me a place to live by the beach, no you're not sending me to live at any of the 10 shelters you offered. I went to X shelter before and they have roaches and a man catcalled me at Y shelter and if you send me there I will get raped and it will be your fault, also at Z shelter they were mean to me. Shelter A? They have rules I don't want to have to deal with.""

Now that I'm working on the child unit, it's a lot of ""You can't send my child home until you find a way to force him to take his medicine and go back to therapy"" and ""My kid still talks back to me even though they're on Abilify. How do I ensure he never is defiant ever again?""

[Imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/IO7ovat), it's three Instagram stories

mods, feel free to remove this if it is not suited for its own post. however, I feel Kim has made a good statement regarding how the media and public should treat both Kanye and his family during this stressful time for them

**edit:** transcription -

>	[1] As many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand. I've never spoken publicly about how this has affected us at home because I am very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health. But today, I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health.

>	Those that understand mental health or even compulsive behavior know that the family is powerless unless the family member is a minor. People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgmental and not understand that the individual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try.

>	[2] I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions. He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder. Those who are close to Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.

>	Living with bi-polar disorder does not diminish or invalidate his dreams and his creative ideas, no matter how big or unobtainable they may feel to some. That is part of his genius and as we have all witnessed, many of his big dreams have come true.

>	[3] We as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental as a whole, however we should also give it to the individuals who are living with it in times when they need it the most. I kindly ask that the media and public give us the compassion and empathy that is needed so that we can get through this. Thank you for those who have expressed concern for Kanye's well being and for your understanding.

2375,"My nanny got hospitalized w/ schizophrenia, what do I do w/her employment?",741,1678f9h,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1678f9h/my_nanny_got_hospitalized_w_schizophrenia_what_do/,311,"Long story short, I hired a wonderful nanny in her fifties earlier this year when I had another baby. Since then she has been my saving grace and helped me with taking care of the kids and general housechores. She has jumped at the chance at the extended hours I have offered, even commuting an hour each way to help us. I have noticed that she has struggled with anxiety and other health problems since she started with us. For example she sleeps very poorly at night, never eats, barely drinks or uses the restroom when she is working for us, starts to shed some tears if my toddler cries intensely, and becomes avoidant and anxious when my toddler throws a tantrum. I have brought up my observations with her several times.

Today I was quite shocked when someone in her family called me and told me she was hospitalized with schizofrenia and won’t be able to work for a while. 
Apparently, she is not doing too well. She is quite spaced out, doesn’t know where she is and has paranoia (believes she is being followed) etc. They claim this is the first episode but I am not so sure due to some of the signs I am now seeing click in place - and I have reason now to think she might have witheld her diagnosis during the interview.

Am I correct to assume that finding the correct medication to become stable is a very lengthy process and there are no guarantees that she will take them?
I have very young children and I would now be very concerned about leaving them with her without me being present. I am scared she will have another episode and not be able to care for them and them getting hurt. I say this as I have a family member with the same condition and it is very scary when he has an episode. For example, during an episode an aggressive new person emerges with a demon voice and he says «bad things gonna happen if you don’t get way from me» and then him going into a state where he undresses and cannot hear or communicate with anyone.

I feel now that beingpresent constantly kills the point of having a nanny as I need to be able to go out of the house and go back to work at some point.

What should I do going forward. Should I employ a temp for now and talk to her directly when she is recovered enough? What if I find out she has witheld her diagnosis and not taken her medication? If I let this person go, how should I go about it? My daughter is very bonded with her. Should I let them have a parting meeting?
Should I give her a sizable parting check? 
Sorry for all the questions. I have some many thoughts at the moment and I am hoping for some new viewpoints and advice.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit:

Thank you all so so much for all of your advice. I am truly humbled that so many people have taken their time and given me such good advice and insight.
I have learned a lot from reading all your responses and I feel the way forward is now clear. 

Assuming the diagnosis is correct:
I agree that my nanny is in a very vulnerable position and will need a lot of professional help going forward. She is in no position to take care of vulnerable children, now or in the future. Doing so would be rolling the dice and I am not willing to take any risks with my children.

As many of you pointed out, due to her age, it is unlikely (although not impossible) this is her first mental episode. Whether she is unaware of that or if she has been withholding the information, remains unclear until I speak with her myself. I will keep an open mind that there may be other medical possibilities that has resulted in her hospitalization and schizophrenic symptoms, but I am afraid it might be wishful thinking on my part. 

Going forward, I will start looking for a new nanny as I am in need of an immediate replacement. When my nanny finally does contacts me, I will schedule a meeting in public place with her - plus her and my husband. My husband and I will bring with us some art work from my toddler, a thank you letter and a severance check - and essentially we will see how things play-out during the meeting. 

For all I know she might quit on her own accord as she is normally a very empathetic, non confrontational, sweet and understanding person. However, as someone mentioned here, I do not know how she is when she is out of sorts. 
For example my family member who I mentioned in my post that has the condition is completely different now than he was before he got ill. Now, generally he has very disorganized, irrational thoughts. Sometimes he suffers from memory loss.

Therefore, by meeting her, I can thank her in person for her good service but also see if she is suffering from confusion, memory loss/ blackouts that can possibly result in her showing up unannounced at my door or my toddler’s kindergarten in the future. 

As far as the legal aspect, thank you for the heads up. I will bear it in mind, although,I do not think it will be a problem due to the way things work in my country.
Again, thank you all so much for your advice and support. I was really positively surprised!

2428,Interdimensional Aliens are the root cause of schizophrenia and many other mental illnesses!,429,163baxj,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/163baxj/interdimensional_aliens_are_the_root_cause_of/,281,"I can't believe this is so limited to find on the internet, while it is absolutely obvious but there is an annoying twist. There are poltergeists without bodies among us in lower dimensions and may come across as dark shadow blobs smelling like smoke that many schizophrenic people see changing over time, **you will hear people talk about it in the comments** and there are aliens or hybrids with a body, operating in higher dimensions. **They are not space aliens** but hybrids or mutants vessels created straight from earth.   
The reptilian aliens originated from Velociraptor DNA running a hybridization program to become humanoid and walk among us to influence society. This also goes for gray aliens which originate from a giant praying mantis which people also see during DMT drug use. 

&#x200B;

[The hybridization program.](https://preview.redd.it/seda1al7irkb1.jpg?width=2217&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68ffb2db008b69d30a6ed8719c938b3b79e015d4)

In regards to poltergeists, this makes up for there being different type of alien abductions and sightings. Sleep paralysis are done by invisible shadow blobs or figures, out of body abductions are done by an (**astral body**) orb. Physical abductions are done by either a craft or object of light, also related to the (**Body of Light**) which is a state of dematerializing into photon particles. I'll post wiki links in the comments about this. 

Here are few different body type techniques aliens use, almost nobody knows this yet: **This is related to real paranormal sightings we are having.**

&#x200B;

[Small clouded UFO orbs are astral bodies, this is how they abduct people with an out of body experience, it's basically a transparent copy of your body called an astral projection, is why aliens or hybrids can appear as ghost sightings.](https://preview.redd.it/5cd225m7grkb1.jpg?width=381&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab9485114d6988b816418c7c8ae2a7422e615dbb)

&#x200B;

[Bright UFO orbs: This is a Body of light used for physical transport abductions, it's basically dematerializing into biophoton particles into an energyfield to travel in higher realms, planes or what we call Dimensions. ](https://preview.redd.it/nrpeolbfgrkb1.jpg?width=514&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21376a33f7363a95d1b4c0ea724d5729e0499458)

Having said this, this is why aliens or hybrids are related to poltergeist activity, they use black magic powers or techniques like magicians and mentalists. They can read your minds, predict movements you make or simply control you in any direction they want through calculations and matrix codes, it's  a form of subliminal hypnosis. 

The only evidence for human hybrids walking among us at the moment are paranormal videos like cryptids, people having mental illnesses, or having alter egos. They are trying to run our lives like it's a game, there are several movies hinting to this.   
Here are a few movies related to real mental health cases and controlled possessions mostly related to **Gangstalking**:

**They Live** (aliens live inside of us)  
**The Truman show** (as the actors running the simulation, causing planned and staged events)  
**The Box** (using humans as a proxy, watching you through the eyes of others)  
**The Game** (playing with us)  
**Eyes Wide Shut** (mind controlling the elites, giving them alter egos or engaging into perverted acts.)

The message of this post and the answer of these movies are, invisible aliens or apparitions are possessing people from an unseen dimension, they also can give people nightmares, hallucinations, alter people's perception or give people alter ego's.   
I'm not interested in promoting my sub **/Alienhybridsabuse** but I collect there all my research and evidence also hoping experiencers will share their testimonies there for researching purposes. I managed to link elites abusing children to alter ego's and possessions. 

[The evidence for Aliens Walking among us are poltergeist apparitions and possession.](https://preview.redd.it/4k2rswacorkb1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b658f107c8973aa61c60f73014570ffa721e0603)

Also I managed to get in contact with 2 alien hybrids through my research, they were remote viewing me and guessed my personal info which is what they can do, so this is not a joke. I now figured out through an abductee and Target individual I simply talked with their alter ego's, which is linked to **DID = Dissociative Identity Disorder**. There are beings that attach themselves towards your silvercord, this is why some people have magic abilities, seeing hallucinations and many more stuff. The movie **Split** answers this correctly.

My friend has been leveling a pally and was really interested in dungeon tanking on him. We usually play as a trio and he is currently perfect for Deadmines. He’s level 23, full blacksmithing and bought gear, all spells to this point bought, he has consecration and righteous fury, no reason in my mind he couldnt tank a deadmines run.

We start putting a group together and find a mage. We’re a trio so we only need a healer now. We find a pally healer, he dips right after joining. Then we find a 22 priest. Perfect! We’re well over leveled and should have a really safe run. The priest asks who’s tanking so I name my friend. He drops group immediately. I whispered him and asked why and I got a “pally tank no no no go gl”. This happened with two more healers before we gave up. 

I played a pally tank all the way through classic and remember it being safe and a blast. He’s our open world tank and I’ve never had agro problems against him. (I’m a rogue and my other friend is a mage so both single target and aoe). 

I’m just wanting to get community opinions on this. Should I just tell him to give up and it’s not viable? Is there something we’re missing? 

For clarification:

Yes I am aware paladins don’t have a taunt. This is strictly for dungeon leveling. 

Yes I am aware some dungeons have threat drops. These don’t. I would understand if this was scholo but it’s an overleveled dungeon group.
