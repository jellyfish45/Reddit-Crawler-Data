Should I exclude people from study?
    Looking at plot, there's a few outliers in treatment group we're having trouble matching

user_comparison_std_mean_diff.ipynb - should I normalize before PCA here? Is PCA on just selected train + control groups good?

PCA - cutoff of 80 varaince explanation

Using 0.2 for this



TODOS
Clean up code (this is actually important rn bc I'll be gone for two wks)
- for analysis - on topics that have score >.2 -> invalid check coefficient in propensity score matching to see if its important 
---- as long as are significant, we should include 
Normalize -> rank importance by coefficient in propensity score 
For outliers in treatment group, look at where they outlie (which features)

Distribution of propensity score for treatment + control

Code for analyzing treatment effect

Big data problems bc we have small data
Kernel functions!!!!!!
NN w random noise?
Transformer/RNN


Okay kernel is good for explanability!


Start w/ lienar -> poly (deg 2/3)

This is what the paper she sent me is on for making this causal model 
    That design for processing temporal
