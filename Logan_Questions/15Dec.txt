TODOS (I won't be able to get all these done but lets see how far we get)
    Clean up code (this is actually important rn bc I'll be gone for two wks)
    - for analysis - on topics that have score >.2 -> invalid check coefficient in propensity score matching to see if its important 
    ---- as long as are significant, we should include 
    Normalize -> rank importance by coefficient in propensity score 
    For outliers in treatment group, look at where they outlie (which features)
    
    Code for analyzing treatment effect (kernel functions looking fire)

    *(Easy)
        Change sort for invalid to be based on strength of coefficient, not SMD 


DONE
    Clean Up Partially
    Coefficients are done (but not analyzed) - also have summed abs value of all em
        No p scores, can replace w/ logistic regression if needed (and I think those will have p values)
    Distribution of propensity score for treatment + control (these r hella good - it can't figure it out from the data we provided)
