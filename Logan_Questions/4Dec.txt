1) How many neighbors do we need 
2) How close do we need to match 
3) Is matching on everything practical

TODOS 
    Remaining
        Importance of features from propesnity score matching -> when analyzing

    Done
        for matching, do PCA first (should add weights automatically from this)
        Propensity score matching 
        Max-min -> sigma
        Standardized mean difference for analysis instead

Less urgent TODOS 
- set up db for reddit data

For each of variables do standardized mean distance (difference in mean of both group)

When run propensity score can look at importance of difference features
