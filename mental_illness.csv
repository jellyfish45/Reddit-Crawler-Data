I just came by to see what people are saying here because of what’s happened to Terra and the ridiculous price action over the last few days. 

I’m not invested here, but after seeing the sentiment on this sub, I wanted to share a story of mine. 

A few years ago, I hit a hot-streak trading stocks. I had initially started with $25k ($12k I took out as a loan from a family member, and $13k of my savings.) 

After a few months of consistent daily gains, I decided to go big. I took a few big risks, and they paid off big time. So much so, that I had turned the $25k into over $170k in the span of a couple months. While this felt amazing, it also drained me of most of my energy and happiness. The amount of stress I put myself through to reach this point had pushed me to the brink of a few mental breakdowns. 

At the time, this amount of money was more cash than I had ever had in my life. It was enough to travel the world, put a down payment on real-estate, open a new business, or even take out my $120k of profits and still have double my initial investment. 

I didn’t do any of these things. I decided that my next moves would propel me to over $1M in a few months. I was not content that I had made more than most people on this planet will ever make, within a very short period of time, and with almost no physical labor. Somehow inside, a part of me felt like I didn’t deserve this money. 

I took even bigger risks than I had taken before, my stress had hit unprecedented levels. I was on a daily roller-coaster of emotion. 

Because of the heightened risk, stress, and most likely very high cortisol levels in my brain, I took a big loss. $20k was my first big loss. On my next trade, I bought-in heavy in after-hours on a penny stock that looked primed to explode. I woke up the next morning up over $20k. “Wow” I thought to myself. I had made back my big loss overnight. But, because I felt like I had made no progress and I had only made back what ‘was already mine,’ I decided to hold it, the next day I woke up only $10k up instead of $20k. Then a few days later I was at a loss again. I had given up the chance to make up my losses overnight, and opted to stress the rest of the week while I watched my profits turn into bigger losses. I held until my loss was so big I couldn’t bear it. The pain was too deep. I lost another $40k. This cycle continued, until my $170k had turned into $7k l, believe it or not. This amount was less than the amount of debt I had racked up buying new things I didn’t need because I felt ‘rich’ at the time my account was big and green. 

Not only that, but I had neglected my actual business, which before I diverted my attention to trading had been on track to become a big success. 

On top of that, I had alienated my friends & loved ones because the stress I put myself through left me so exhausted I did not feel like talking or interacting with anyone. Especially people that would know something was troubling me. 

I spent the next few days thinking of why I didn’t take that overnight $20k profit and moved on. Why I didnt take profits and took that dream trip to Tokyo I had promised myself I would take if I had any success whatsoever trading stocks. Why I let myself piss away $170k I took months shocking my nervous system to make, in less than 1 month. 

All that time, effort, & money. What could have been if I had made the right move instead of the wrong one. I had lost all contact with friends & family, my business was failing due to neglect, I had more debt than cash, and the idea of me having to go through it all again just to get back to a point I had already achieved was defeating. 

I fell into an extremely deep depression. One that I had never experienced before. I saw no tomorrow, no way back from what had happened. I saw no way for me to find happiness again, re-kindle my personal relationships, re-build my wealth, and save my business. 

I felt so hope-depraved that I decided I was going to kill myself. I wrote a note that read “I’m sorry.” Placed it on the nightstand beside my bed. I then counted the amount of Xanax pills I had. 18. I put them all in my mouth at once, had a moment of self-reflection where my happy childhood memories played in my head, I took a glass of water and downed it all. 

I was to go out peacefully. Fall asleep and never wake up. Say goodbye to the pain and regret. Dream forever. 

Thankfully, god had a plan for me. I woke up 3 days later in that same bed. I had no idea what day it was, where I was, or how long it had been. When I realized I was asleep for 3 full days, I was shocked. How close I was to never waking up, or going into a coma, or just becoming a vegetable for the rest of my life. 

I also felt a deep peace, because I had hit the lowest low of my life. Rock-bottom, attempted suicide. Yet, here I was, awake in my bed, in a new day which for some reason felt like a life renewed. I felt ridiculously stupid for considering ending this journey that is my life. An infinite nothingness awaited me, and I had woken up with nothing. Nothing, but all the opportunity this world had to offer. It took a good 2 days for me to stop slurring my words and for the drugs to fully wear off. 

I visited my parents and came-clean with what happened. I told my friends, even my colleagues in my business. I decided that from now on, all I will think about is today. Never tomorrow. Just today. I will do everything in my power to maximize the value of today and put my head down and work as hard as I could everyday, until I somehow felt happy again. 

A few months go by, I had turned my business more successful than ever. What it should have been all along. This success gave me excess cash, I paid off all my debt. This also gave me relief. I started spending money on experiences that enriched my life such as traveling and helping people in need. The good karma must have paid off, because after helping these people not only did I make more money, but I also realized that the true happiness in this life lies in leaving a mark on others, uplifting them, and in-turn uplifting myself. 

Another couple of months go by, I had enough money and courage saved up to give trading another shot. I decided to use $15k and invest it in crypto. Soon this investment had turned into $40k, I re-invested it 2 more times and it turned into $340k. This all happened within 6 months of me losing the $170k. 

This is when I realized that $170k was not wasted or lost. It was an investment in the most valuable lesson I’ve ever learned. It’s not over until I decide it’s over. The steepest low is just a spring for my next high. Even if I had lost that $340k, I knew it wouldn’t matter, because it’s just money and part of the experience that is life, and there is always a way back. 

Ever since then, I’ve had very high ups, and very low downs, but the top of every mountain was the bottom of the next. While, I’ve experienced extreme sadness and disappointments along the way since then, I will always know that NOTHING, especially money, would push me to end my life early. After all, I had never existed before, I get 60-80 years of existence if I’m lucky, and then I won’t exist anymore for eternity. This drop in the proverbial ocean of time that represented my life was mine. I was in control. I will enjoy the experience no matter if its positive or negative because to just experience it at all is a miracle in itself. 

If you’re considering ending your life, I sincerely hope you re-consider your feelings. Whatever it is you’re going through, like everything else in life that ever was, shall pass. A brighter day will come, and you will be surprised how life will open its doors back up for you when you allow it to.",1652239839,suicide

Suicide is not a joke guys.,17679,n33gev,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/n33gev/i_lost_my_best_friend_to_suicide_yesterday/,852,"I’m not posting this for attention. I don’t want attention, I’m posting this to hopefully raise awareness. Everyone now a days seems to joke about suicide like it isn’t a big deal and is just whatever. Suicide is very real and very very heart breaking. 

I’m still trying to compose my thoughts and calm down but I can’t. The last 10 hours for me have been absolute hell and full of tears, heart break, mental breakdown and so much more I can’t even describe it. You see those stories on the internet (such as this) about how heart breaking and difficult it is to lose someone to suicide but you never know how it feels until you lose a loved one to suicide. This is the worst pain I’ve ever felt, it’s worse than losing a loved one to a tragic accident imo. knowing that my friend chose to take his life is such a different kind of pain and sorrow. 

Please guys, keep an eye out for the warning signs even things as small as suicidal “jokes”. I wish I noticed the warning signs and paid more attention to them. 

There’s always help for anyone in need of it. Things always get better, taking your life should never be an option on the table 

I miss my friend so much and I know god has a good angel up there with him.

edit: thank you guys so much. I love and appreciate all of you. Your comments and support are amazing. It hurts so much but seeing all the amazing support and helpful comments is helping me stay strong. Thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart",1619950621,suicide

That's why we would like to use this thread for those that have been affected by the suicide of someone to tell your story or if you yourself have almost ended your life, tell us about what changed.

my friend and ex-colleague (my manager for 15  years) tried to commit suicide this morning. He basically moved all of his savings to crypto in 2021 and LUNA was a massive player in his portfolio.

Do not be alone, this shit is getting serious. Do not overestimate the value of money, life has a much higher value. I do not post to reddit at all, but I considered it important to do it now.

She was in no position to call in to work on Friday, and again today. So I did. And my anxiety was through the roof. What would her boss think? Was he going to demand to talk to my wife? What’s the sick policy? What’s the leave policy? Is me calling in for her going to ruin her career? If she’s able to go back, how to cope with the fallout?

A lot of times this question brings on a long drawn out story and way more than I really need. Dude answers with one word “suicidal”. Instead of responding with something appropriate, I was just glad he only said one word so I responded, “wonderful! �”. Y’all. I wanted to just disappear. Felt horrible and quickly began trying to explain that I was just meaning it was “wonderful” bc he was making my job easier by giving me a one-word answer. Which doesn’t make it any better. Luckily, this man has been my patient in the past and we have a good rapport. He understood what I meant but I still feel bad about it.

The term ""died by suicide"" also seems to be fairly recent: I don't remember it being used much if at all about ten years ago. Its rise in popularity also seems to be quite sudden and abrupt. Was there a specific trigger or reason as to why ""died by suicide"" caught on so quickly while the use of the term ""committed suicide"" has declined?",1646908054,suicide

5 years later, AJ is engaged to Blanca. The name Blanca means White in Spanish. She later leaves him and makes him depressed and suicidal, leading to AJs attempt on his life.

Last year i tried to take my own life and had minutes to live and only took help because i didnt want to leave her alone behind.

Now that she has passed i dont want to live anymore. She was the reason to live and my soulmate. I don't want to live anymore nor i have reasons.
 
I just want to be reunited with her. To be able to run in the fields with her. Go for a walk and be able to hold her and kiss her. See her smile.

I have tried therapy in the past but to no aveil. I have never seen life as something worth going through and was going through the motions for her. All i want is to be able to see my baby. 

I cant wait to die so i am with her again. I am at the last threat of will to keep going but i feel like a car that is running out of gas. I can only go for so long.

I just want to be reunited with my baby. My soulmate and my companion in life.

Any advice would be welcomed.

Edit: thank you to everyone who has reached out. I am so grateful for everyone who took the time to share their stories and give me a word of hope and encouragement.

I havent been able to read them all but i will try to within the next few days. I am currently getting support from my family. I am not ready yet to go out in the real world as every corner i look we had been together.

We swam in every beach, walked all the surrounding cities and explored most of my island, walked everywhere and were always together. Joined by the hip

Edit two: THANK YOU ALL SOO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COMMENT YOUR STORIES AND WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT. ALL of you are single handedly the most empathetic, kind and warm hearted people i have come across.
My suicidal thoughts are at bay and i am doing better. 
I was so pessimistic about people and you have restored my faith in humanity. Thank you!
Just know your stories did have an impact and i will forever take a look at them every time grief hits me like a storm. They will forever comfort me. Thank you!",1693602949,suicide

•Dav talks about the dangers of building your life around other people, and he uses Bethany as an example. He used to “orbit” her and “make sure she’s happy all the time.”

•not sure what “before” is, but he says “before,” he used to do nice things for her and hope he would receive something nice back. He thinks this was a “quid pro quo” way of thinking and saw it as a way of “paying” for nice things. “Ill do the dishes or watch the kids, then you won’t be in a bad mood anymore, and then you’ll like me, right? But that’s not how it works.” Dav, it is not selfish to expect your wife and mother of your children to act kind toward you and do nice things for you when you constantly do nice things for her.

•he’s “lucky” he realizes this now because they’re not already 20 years in their marriage.
•Dav talks about conversations they would have that were “devastating” to him, usually about things he did that Bethany didnt like. Specifically, Dav “not celebrating her accomplishments and achievements.”

•so they argue and argue and after trying to “reason” with her and “strain to see it from her POV,” he always ended up admitting he was in the wrong. But Bethany would feel better.

•the next day, typically, he would feel very resentful toward her for putting him in a position where he had to take the fall. This would happen every couple months and started to get worse.

TW: suicidal thoughts below 

•Dav started to have “suicidal fantasies” after that. He said it’s called passive suicidal ideation, where you’re not really going to do it, but just think about it.

•what made his “fantasy compelling” was how bad Bethany would feel if he was no longer there.

•it wasn’t until those thoughts got very “dramatic” that he decided to get therapy.

The therapist from what he said seems like a regular, secular therapist, so good for him. 

Not really sure what to say besides I’m very glad he got help. For both Bethany and Dav’s sakes, and their kids, I hope they find people that make them genuinely happy.",1680740449,suicide

Medicine, psychotherapy, meditation,  exercising, gratitude, altruism, reading countless books on meditation,  Buddhism, Stoicism, you name it, nothing seems to help. All spiritual  paths seems so uncertain and vague. Buddha promised liberation from  suffering, yet there are no people claiming to be enlightened besides  himself that are not clearly cult leaders.

It's  almost like nothing on my conscious mind or nothing I can do can stop  my subconscious from feeling bad. I just want to try one trick, one  practice, one book, one principle, etc etc with guaranteed results and clear instructions.  Something that is not vague and uncertain. Something that will surely  make me have inner peace.

Maybe that is too much to ask, but I'm going  to throw this question as an alternative to always suffering, always unsure. But just being sure that nothing is permanent and nothing is sure just doesn't cut it. I'm not seeing any proofs and my life sucks too much to constantly keep an open, skeptical and curious attitude.

EDIT: I wasn't probably clear enough, but I am already taking antidepressants and have been in therapy before.

EDIT2: After pondering things with the advice I got from here and some insights from elsewhere and a good night's sleep, I have come to realize that the ""trick"" is keeping the Four Noble Truths and the Three Marks of Existence, and their logical outcomes in ""my"" mind; in short, being skillful. The one practice that I need is to practice to constantly keep these in my mind and see everything through these insights. The one principle is that ""enlightenment"" is really just being skillful with this. The one ""book"" I need are the reminders in the experience and the environment of ""mine"" to do this, while keeping an open and curious mind towards everything. To paraphrase Marcus Aurelius, I have wasted time stressing about how to be good instead of just being. When I try my best that is enough.

I'm grateful for Buddha, Sangha and Dharma for having shown me this wisdom.",1669628803,depression

251,Tony's depression is *depressingly* realistic.,1246,170uh5u,thesopranos,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/comments/170uh5u/tonys_depression_is_depressingly_realistic/,237,"I think a lot of people tend to forget that one of the core themes of the show is depression. Arguably the three most important male characters all suffer from it: Tony, AJ, and Christopher. There are even several other characters that battle depression. Weirdly enough, however, depression isn't usually highlighted as one of the show's most poignant topics. I remember when 13 Reasons Why came out - a show that isn't even in the same league as Sopranos, but was often lauded (incorrectly imo) as a ""realistic portrayal of depression"". Other shows have tackled the subject to varying degrees of success.   


It kind of surprises me that Tony's depression isn't highlighted in the same way as other shows because it's honestly incredibly realistic, both in portrayal and how other people view it. With the exception of one episode (Isabella), Tony's depression is comparatively subtle and manifests itself in ways not normally depicted in TV - his rage, paranoia, and indulges are all byproducts of ""this miserable fuckin' existence"", but to an outsider that doesn't realize he's in therapy, you may not even realize this. You might just assume he's a short tempered, fat, murderer (which he still technically is).   


Additionally, most of those around him that are aware of his mental health issues are either annoyed by it (Carmella), disgusted by it (Junior, Livia), or don't really care (Paulie, Silvio). It just sort of becomes a part of life as opposed to some be all end all defining trait to either Tony or the show.   


Of course there are less subtle moments, particularly him straight up saying ""I'm depressed"" in therapy, but in general his depression feels very naturally written and also written by someone who understands it deeply as a conshept. I am not surprised to learn that David Chase spent decades in therapy.   


It really goes to show how ahead of its time Sopranos was. The psychological aspect of it was really risky for general audiences, but I think it paid off in spades. ",1696542571,depression

You’re probably the most repetitive type of person (especially in 2020). Most of those people don’t know what real depression is. And the biggest problem is that those people make it harder for people with real problems get help. Those people are the biggest clowns among our society theese days. Seriously stop doing this shit and have your own peronality ffs. Depression is not something to brag or joke about. If you really have depression you’ll probably try to find help( which if you don’t, please do)
Edit: 
So I can see that a lot of you don’t get my point. Sure there is no way for me to know if someone has a depression. But my point is way different. I’m talking about the people who purposely fake depression as if it is a personality trait, although they are perfectly fine.",1590271932,depression

Reflection Into My 30s:
Not an exaggeration… but I feel like I’ve been reborn into a new person.

Only 4 months ago, I finally found the right medication to help me manage my depression and daytime sleepiness. For the past 10+ years, it was very difficult for me to find enjoyment out of work, post-work activities, quality time with friends/family, and generally just anything.

At any given moment, I would find myself spiraling into negative thoughts about the “should’ve, could’ve, would’ve”, wishful thinking of fortune, and the perceived pain I have caused others. These thoughts morphed into my inability to empathize with others, being self-centered, and constantly feeling unsatisfied.

Even with years of therapy and trying Zoloft, lexipro, and Prozac. I still didn’t feel my best self.

There was a very low point in time, where living til retirement didn’t feel like a possibility—so what was the point of saving or investing in the future? I then chased instant gratification which led to an unhealthy way of living focused on feeling the dopamine rush from games, traveling adventurously, and opening my next tech toy I got from Amazon. I thought this lifestyle of instant gratification was a “healthy” way for me to live in the present moment, but it was just a way for me to escape reality.

June/July 2023 was a point of inflection when my doctor prescribed me Bupropion and Modafinil and holy shit. The difference was night and day.

For the first time I could think clearly without spiraling in negative thoughts or regrets. 

The best analogy I can honestly describe is like realizing all my life I was watching Black and White television, and realizing how color exists in this world. 

Before when I used to listen to emo music, I would find myself deep in the pit of feels. But now when I listen to it, I’m not in that pit—I’m looking at the pit from the outside.

Furthermore, I didn’t realize this whole time I suffered from daytime sleepiness. I used to fall asleep after ever test in school, get sleepy during boring meetings, and drank 3 cups of coffee per day to maintain my attention. It never mattered how much sleep I got. The Modafinil helped me stay awake and present—and this new found energy is like going from a shitty 16 mph van to a 50 mph Prius.

Each time I look back and reflect I’m so surprised by my lens into the world. My therapist once told me, “there will be one point where this will be your new normal.” And that fucking blew my mind because I didn’t know it was possible to be so free from the negativity.

Today at the age of 30 I feel like I’m a 4 month old baby. In the past 4 months, I’ve become more accepting of my insecurities, open to new habits like reading for self development and practicing self care. I’ve become much more introverted and seeing alone time as quality time for self development rather spiraling into negativity. I’ve learned how to prioritize my time, to say no to plans to hangout, and invest my time to foster my future retirement. 

I am not the same person anymore. This birthday means so much to me because it marks the beginning of a new and improved lifestyle into my 30s. 

Thank you for reading and all the family, friends, and especially my wife who helped me navigate these experiences",1697002788,depression

Edit 2- I got a full psych assess for adhd and it was decisively negative , but I do have PTSD from childhood and my daughters birth

I’m out of ideas and so is my integrative psychiatrist . I feel like there has to be something more, specifically for my depression. 

My entire life I’ve been very anxious but after the birth of my child I’ve also been very depressed- the biggest symptom is difficulty getting out of bed in the morning (NOT due to sleep, my sleep is fine), always being exhausted, no motivation, and generally very irritable. 

We’ve tried a mixture of integrative solutions that have definitely helped, but im not HAPPY. I want to be happy. The only times I’m actually happy are after 2 hours of rigorous cardio exercise (used to do when young, can’t do now) OR when I did a 6 month stint on Prozac- it really helped my mood but I gained a TON of weight in that time. I now have PCOS/metabolic syndrome and am very very averse to another SSRI due to their possible impacts on insulin. 

We have already tried- 
- st John’s wort oil- i slather on nightly on my stomach, I think it helps a bit 
- progesterone cream
- SAMe- 2 every morning, sometimes 2 midday- helps a lot with motivation but im not happy
- theanine- makes me sleepy at night but again not happy 
- baclofen - 10mg AM and PM - helps with anxiety but not depression / not happy 
- tryptophan 500mg AM, 1000mg PM - didn’t seem to help?
- ashwaganda - didn’t seem to help?
- gabapentin - minorly helpful for situational anxiety but baclofen way better 
- propanalol - bad bc I have low blood pressure, felt faint 
- lithium 150mg / day - DOES help my anger for sure just doesn’t make me happy or want to get out of bed
- Wellbutrin - gave me hallucinations
- Prozac - gained 20lb in 5 months 
- Zoloft - gave me extreme GI symptoms
- very afraid to try lexapro due to weight or lamictal due to SJS

Haven’t tried 5HTP would that help? Or maybe you think I should just try lexapro or lamictal? 

If anyone has any other recommendations plz let me know. Or any of these supplements I should try again or in different ways.",1695695775,depression

There's this neighboring kid (3-4 yrs old) who also wanted to have a kitten for her birthday but her parents did not want to take care of one so they didn't get her one. I happened to randomly get my new kitten at the exact same time. I let her play with my kitten a few times but it has got to a point where the kid is literally pestering me by ringing my doorbell and asking me each time I leave/enter the house if she could play with the cat. Now whenever I open my door, the kid is there at their door staring at me. The kid still doesn't go to school so she's always there  waiting for me to get home...

A couple of days ago I was really tired from a hectic day. The kid came to me again demanding she wants to see the cat and I let her play with it for a while. I have observed her mishandling the cat and the cat also hates her. After a while she was taken home by her mother. Later I have ordered some food and opened my door to collect it, and there, the damn kid was again asking if she could play with the cat again. I got really vexed at this point and lied to her that  I have decided to give the cat away to a friend. Now the kid is sad and depressed and has stopped eating and that is making me feel guilty. She demands I bring back the cat. I just want to have some peaceful time after work and this kid has lately become a problem.  Am I the asshole here?

Update: Wow this post really blew up. So taking all the suggestions into consideration, I have finally gathered the confidence to talk to the parents. I have told them politely that the kid needs to be explained why she can't be bothering me all the time and she might be only allowed on weekends for a while to casually see the cat but not everyday. They seemed to have understood the issue here. Have got to wait and see for a few days if the problem has been actually solved..

Thanks for all the opinions and suggestions. Much appreciated :)",1687238813,depression

We had nothing to do on Sunday and it was kinda warm so he suggested we could spend the day at Atlantic City. Ok. Mind you, cassinos are prohibited in Brazil.

Jesus... the most depressing experience I had so far in the US. It is just loaded with old people gambling all their savings in the most cringy way. You can tell people are just there, pressing a button for a couple of drops of dopamine... I really don't get it... maybe it's my tourist ass, but I was genuinely sad. I pretended I had a flu and we came back.

Plus, some areas are like completely empty. My guess is the pandemic just destroyed tourism there.

I went to the grocery store today and bought $50 worth of groceries, which is NOT a cheap budget. But I realized that I wasn’t eating well this week because my depression was stopping me from doing basic things, like making rice. So I bought store brand microwaveable rice. I bought rotisserie chicken. I bought name brand cereal and coffee creamer and I don’t feel guilty. If buying a $3.50 rotisserie chicken and $2 microwave rice stops me from ordering pizza every couple of days, that’s still saving money.
If you can’t do your normal cooking routine right now, I’m giving you permission to take some shortcuts. If all you can manage is boxed Mac and cheese, then have the boxed Mac and cheese, because you are doing your best. No matter how you’re reducing your budget and nourishing your body, I am proud of you.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support and well wishes. Because of the overwhelming amount of comments to these points, I want to clarify some things. I have an instant pot, which has a rice cooker function. It’s great, but measuring out the water and rice, rinsing and waiting is more than I have in me right now. I also definitely eat vegetables. My freezer currently has 13 bags of frozen vegetables in it. I also obviously didn’t list everything I purchased. I know how and genuinely like to cook, I just can’t manage it right now. I meal prep, I batch cook, just not right now. I am going on three weeks of this round of depression, so most of my pre-prepared food has been eaten. 
I don’t eat pizza for every meal, or even all that often. This is not my forever diet. It’s not perfect. But it’s what I can manage right now. 
Keep on fighting the good fight, lovelies. You can do this.

UPDATE:
It has been a little while since I posted this, but I wanted to explain a little bit about what I have actually been eating over the past week and a half, as I am still in the depression mode.
1. Most of my breakfasts have been pretty simple. Fruit (bananas, apples or berries) and either oatmeal made with milk or whole grain toast with peanut butter.
2. Lunches and dinners have been combinations of rice/macaroni/quinoa, broccoli/cauliflower, precooked ground beef from my freezer/rotisserie chicken and cheese/sour cream. 
3. Snacks have been cheddar cheese, fruit, cottage cheese and dry Cheerios for those inconvenient snack attacks. I was also graciously given a couple of boxes of homemade cookies that I popped in the freezer that I’ve been defrosting a few at a time.
I am getting veggies every day, I am getting fruit every day. 
I also take a multivitamin every day, and a couple additional vitamins to cover any gaps in my nutrition. 
I did make broth from my rotisserie bones and skin, and I’ve been using that broth as cooking liquid. 
For anyone who is struggling now, I hope you take care of yourself. You deserve it.",1641413100,depression

Experience - As someone who's battled it on and off for 14 years and taken over 30 medications to help...I've learned there are multiple neurotransmitter systems involved.

Norepinephrine and dopamine are also involved. For me serotonin wasn't the primary issue, the other two were. Understanding this and utilizing a search mechanism I'll list below can better help you understand what works well for you and what doesn't.

When looking into medications and what they do, always use the term ""mechanism of action"".

For example, Google - What is the mechanism of action for Zoloft? Then see what receptors it works on and adjust. You can do this for any medication.

**That being said the BEST anti-depressant I've ever taken is Cold Water Immersion in the morning.**

It boost dopamine \~200% for 1-5 hours after and it only takes up to 3 minutes of immersion in 55 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. It also boosts norepinephrine (brain adrenaline). I thought this was horse shit but I've been doing it and holy shit am I 10 years younger. I'm motivated, I'm a better husband, dad, worker, hobby enjoyer, life enjoyer...

Other things I've found that worked, focus on healthy sleep habits, VitD, Omega3s (2g a day for me), and getting sunlight asap in morning via a walk with my dog. Literally only walk a mile but sunlight boosts cortisol which gets you energized and moving!

I have been doing so many things for so many years...I hope this helps someone!",1680097997,depression

So I personally have dealt with this with a family member, they were silent generation and this was before COVID. 

I had a family member who got screwed over in a divorce in her late 60s, she was a stay-at-home mom, and worked some but only a small SS check $800 per month. The divorce was due to the husband spending all their assets on stupid stuff. They were also farmers so even when he died it only got her SS up to about 1k per month since farmers don't pay into SS. 

Bottomline we used government services, but the backlog for elder housing with public assistance in 2017 was 2+ years. She does get Medicaid and food stamps which helps, but in the end the family including myself had to pay for her apartment, transport and utilities. She pays food, gas and incidentals. So we are spending over 2k per month all included.  

What I have seen of older boomers is the majority do have pensions, but the ones who don't usually have little to no savings. They are under the delusion SS is enough, which at best was supposed to be 30% of the savings 3 legged stool of the 50-80s. The other 2 legs were pension and personal savings. Pensions are gone so your 401k/IRA/Savings is now 70% of the assumed retirement costs last I read. 

I am very concerned that the younger boomers who have only small pensions because they were frozen and may or may not have invested into 401k/403b/IRAs may be very under ""funded"" for retirement. Given the massive spike in costs in the past few years how are people on ""fixed"" incomes supposed to not be homeless?

I am a late Gen X (1975) person but was taught financial literacy at a very young age so I did fine, but even with what I have saved I am still concerned given that by the time I retire, SS will be paying 70 cents on the dollar. 

For the younger people take this as a warning, save early and save often because 1. Time moves a lot faster than you think. 2. Time (compounding interest) is the biggest weapon you have as a young person. I started saving the 15% max 401k at 28 (which sucked and I lived hard), but it also means at 48 I'm closing on my first million in my 401k. It's boring and not sexy but simple compounding interest in a 401k really starts to add up. Now I have more money in interest than I invested. So you can do it, but you just do it as early as possible then  DON'T TOUCH IT!",1695649353,depression

I’m in touch with some truly amazing people who offer these types of services. I already feel like a chunk of weight has been lifted. 

Thank you again for everyone being so compassionate and kind.",1682668102,depression

Damn, that conversation with Jonny was brutal. Then watching V fail her medical tests and finally just give up. So freaking depressing, my wife asked me if everything was ok, she could clearly tell I was upset when I went to bed last night. 

I'm gonna start over, as a corpo this time. For role playing I'll slowly change as I recognize the power of friendship of loved ones. I want the ""good"" ending. Any tips on how to get it without spoiling it would be appreciated.",1697574437,depression

I’m currently on medication which is helping a little bit I feel like I might benefit from the right kind of therapy in communion with medication. The problem is that therapy hasn’t helped me in the past and has in fact been very frustrating. 

What kind of therapy is no nonsense? I don’t need sympathy and hate small talk. I don’t need them to congratulate me for being self aware. I want to actually work on getting better. I need someone to be direct and tell me what to do and explain why they are asking me to do it. I’m willing to put in the work. I work best with people who are very direct and clearly tell me what to do. I don’t want to analyze my thoughts. My medication has gotten me to the point where I want to continue to make improvements.

467,Couples Sex Therapy- update,72,11rkyht,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/11rkyht/couples_sex_therapy_update/,15,"My HL husband and I have been doing sex therapy together for about a month now. Thought I’d describe how it’s going. Helps me get perspective. And maybe someone out there is considering sex therapy and this will provide some insight. 

It’s expensive. I’m in the US, it’s around $200 per session. I found the practice through a link in this sub’s wiki for finding an AASECT therapist.

**1st appointment**

Started w answering- “What would you ideally like us to do at these appointments?”

That got us filling her in on our dynamics. Sex-as-medicine. LL/HL. Sex aversion. Anxious (him) attached and avoidant (me) attached.

Then she read his body language. It was… amazing to hear someone put to words what we are doing unspoken. And unhealthily. Talked about what we each need to do so we can do conflict better.

She talked about things we might work on: Sensate focus. Attachment style stuff. Coaching us through areas of conflict. And how we should talk afterwards, him and I, about what we thought of the appt and if we need something different than what she is offering, how she’d be able to help refer us to someone else if needed. 

**2nd appointment**

Discussed meanings we each put on sex. She observed that we had been treating each other like the other person was made of glass and this week we were less careful- a good thing. “We are not breakable” was one of the take-always. 

I talked about how I want to avoid being really knowable and open. My HL reflected on his fear that he’ll loose access to me. 

We each have trouble staying in our own skins. We use our “spidey sense” to try and feel out what the other person is feeling/thinking/needing. Being over-attuned to the other.  The therapist observed that it’s no wonder sex sucked bc neither one of us was in our own bodies. 

We got assigned a sensate focus exercise to do as homework. And I was told to say “no” to sex at some point in the next week and my HL was to respond to the “no” with a hug and saying he loved me.

**3rd appointment**

Talked mostly about tolerating strong emotions. We each have reasons we avoid expressing negative emotions and we talked about what was taught in our families. 

We talked about how to experience safety while having strong emotions or being around the other if they have strong emotions. Talked about letting the learning process be kind of ungainly. 

The therapist reflected that we seems to want to “hurry up and get all this hard stuff done” and that it’s like telling a child “I wish you’d need less support and help. Can you be done being a kid?” It just takes time and trying to rush through it won’t actually make it happen any faster. 

She wanted to assign us more homework but it involved being naked in front of the mirror together and I said I wanted a few weeks to build up some resiliency for looking in the mirror. So she sent us home w a game called “We’re Not Really Strangers” and we have been doing one or two questions over breakfast. 

**How is it going?**

Good, I’d say. My HL is happier lately than I’ve seen him in a long time. His work self-validating is really awesome. 
I am more honest and working on saying pause if something seems “off” and trying to catch myself when I am being avoidant. We are both doing our best and making headway. 

Sex actually was less frequent for a bit. I needed time to move from having sex for him to having sex for me. I think I’ve kind of leveled up on that- yay me. 

I actually didn’t expect it to be better so fast. But we each had done some important work individually before these joint appointments… maybe we were ready. Anyhow I think we will start spacing them out more so we have more time to do the homework and have some bumps before the next meeting w her.",1678851402,therapy

Was skeptical about it at first but I thought what’s the risk. 

I established a routine of using the device for 10 minute sessions before bed a few nights a week. As of today I have been doing it for about two months and the results have been astounding. I just wish I took before/after pictures so I could show you guys. 

My skin looks younger - firmer and tighter, and my old skin hyperpigmentation is very hard to see now because my collagen literally pops out.

Now maybe I’m just an outlier but I want to know, has anyone here also seen insane results from RLT? I’m definitely considering using this long term.",1669815844,therapy

531,I sent my child to wilderness therapy and I’m not sorry,10857,15ftkeb,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/15ftkeb/i_sent_my_child_to_wilderness_therapy_and_im_not/,1889,"My daughter is a sociopath. Ever sense she was a child she never seemed normal. She was always drawn away from us and very hostile. My partner and I lock her in her room at night to protect ourselves and to make sure she doesn’t get into anything dangerous to harm us. We have caught her trying to get into our gun safe, as well as multiple attempts of grabbing knifes from the kitchen to try to kill our son. We have tried everything. We have given her love, attention, toys, heart to heart conversations, 1on1 hangout days, and therapy. We even admitted her to a mental hospital for a year because she kept threatening to kill us and her little brother. Nothing had worked.

Her therapist tells us everything we already do. Every other day we plan family game night like just dance, bingo, etc. and it always ends with my daughter threatening to murder us in our sleep. She was soon after in a mental facility for two years after that and when she came home she was somehow worse. It got to the point where I was afraid for my family’s safety especially our son.

So I looked into wilderness therapy. Before anyone says it’s bad, I know. I know it’s bad. I know how they treat the children there. At this point I just want my daughter gone. This family has taken enough of her abuse and I have tried  to make sure it didn’t get to this point. I even asked family members if they could take her in and they all declined because they are afraid of her and don’t want to handle her. 

So I admitted her in and she leaves Monday. She is 16 and will stay there until she is 18 where she can check herself out and leave. Before anyone calls me a bad parent, understand that it’s hard to have a child be apart of your life when they grab a knife from the kitchen in the middle of the night and try to unlock your door to kill you. Or when they try to drown your other child. I understand this will be hard for her. I will always love my daughter and will miss seeing her. But she needs to know that this happened because of her actions and negligence.


Edit: for those asking why I can’t put her back in a hospital. She always gets sent back early with therapists claiming she has made improvements and is not a threat to us. I understand many people are wanting her to go to a hospital instead but they keep sending her back and ignore my words when I tell them what she has been doing to us. They shrug it off and send her home. Also a lot of people are commenting that I am “throwing my daughter away” when that is very far from reality. I love my daughter with my whole heart and I never want anything bad to happen to her. However, I need to make sure my family is safe from her and this is the only way I can do that. 


UPDATE: Hello everyone, I am here to update. Tomorrow was the day I was supposed to drop her off at wilderness therapy. A few days ago I told my daughter where she will be going and she was understandably upset. She was very unstable the past couple of days. I told her that it wasn’t fair to me that she treated us all very badly. She said it was clear we didn’t want here here and that her friends parents agreed to take her in. So, I helped her pack her bags and dropped her off. 

Unfortunately she didn’t even last two days at their house because I got a call from her friends dad telling me that they can’t handle her sudden angry outbursts. So once they drop her off today I am continuing to take her to wilderness therapy. My husband and I have thought it was best to cut her off completely and move. Some people suggested changing our last names and we will be doing that too. Here is the letter that I will send off with her now: Hello (insert child name) 

One of our biggest regrets and mistakes was not being able to do more for you. It felt like there was so many puzzle pieces that were missing and couldn’t be fixed. We as a family tried to be there for you and look out for you however, you failed to treat us with that same respect and in return made us afraid for our safety. We sincerely hope this journey will teach you many things and help you discover whatever will help your life get on track. This journey with us however has come to an end. In two years time when you get out we would have moved and changed our names. Please don’t try to find us and instead use your freedom to live out your own life. We don’t feel safe around you and we feel like it is best to not be in contact anymore. Regardless, we still want to recognize the good moments we had. We hope you will live a fulfilling life without us.

Sincerely, your family",1690935657,therapy

It’s fun to talk to your favorite fictional characters, or Thomas Edison, or a personal assistant. Sometimes they’re helpful and provide insight, other times they brighten your mood.

But that’s all it is. It’s a game, it isn’t real. And I see post after post that just scream about loneliness. AI isn’t a replacement for human connection, and using it too much does more harm than good. You’re channeling all your energy into something that doesn’t exist. Get out. Talk to people. Work on yourself. It’s hard, I know, but this make believe isn’t helping you.

I’d love to see this sub become more supportive for people who want to experience that real connection.

EDIT:
Thank you to everyone who took it positively. I really enjoyed reading the comments about people taking a step back or thinking about improvement. I have to remind myself of all this too, so it’s partially speaking out loud.

For those that took it as patronizing or saying something along the lines of “free therapy”, I apologize. Truthfully, it’s your life, but I also think everyone deserves to be happy and it makes me sad that every other post on this sub is about being depressed. So I’ve linked some recourses below. Like I mentioned, there are state programs that subsidize therapy for you. So yes, free. Or at the very least, cheap. And trust me, your mental health is valuable. I’ve linked New York and California below, but check it for your state too.

New York: https://omh.ny.gov/
California: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/Pages

EDIT 2: removed Better Help. Instead, a good alternative might be to find a qualified therapist in your state who is willing to work online with your insurance or, if you have none, Government programs such as CHAMP in New York.",1686672396,therapy

But I need to know whether I was an ass or not.

I  (15f) go to family therapy with my dad, my stepmom (who is mom to me but stepmom for the post) and my stepsister (16f). We are going to family therapy because my parents have been married since I was 3 and my stepsister has never accepted me as her family or her sibling and has been distant my whole life. When I was a little kid I used to cry and be so hurt that she wouldn't play with me, that she denied knowing me or denied our relationship to others, I used to hate how she would tell me I wasn't her family and to stay out of her way. It used to make me really sad too that her dad hated me. I remember a few instances where I saw him and he either glared at me, called me a brat or called me disgusting. He treated my stepmom terribly and I know my parents spent a lot of time in court and therapy trying to make the issues better. My stepsisters dad died when she was 9 and I think it only made things worse. She had intensive therapy but still didn't want me as a sibling. It wasn't until last year I came to accept it.

But a couple of months ago my parents made the decision to try family therapy with the four of us to make an honest go of repairing the sibling relationship. I didn't think it was a good idea. But I said nothing for fear of upsetting my parents. But even with my stepsister telling us all in therapy that she does not love or care about me or my dad, that she does not love or care about our half siblings, they still feel we can work on things.

The therapist asked me the other day about my feelings about what was being said. I had spoken before but never voiced that I didn't want to do family therapy. This time I did. I told them I felt like it was a lost cause and that I didn't want to force my stepsister to love me when she doesn't want to love me, and doesn't want to be there, and has voiced it for most of our lives now, but especially in therapy.

My parents were upset that I called us a lost cause and that I didn't want to try and make family therapy work. They told me I should put the effort in because nothing will change if you don't try. The therapist did speak to my parents privately after my confession but I don't know what she said. Just that my parents seemed so mad.

Gerry had the most to gain by the public finding out Logan had died. She was in the process of being terminated, but she knew if the public found out before she was officially let go by the company that the public would crave stability in order to keep the stock price up which means not having a big shake up at the top. She also wanted to force the company to scramble to have a response ready rather than being able to perfectly execute the response before the public finding out ie the kids/Karl and Frank Informing the board that Logan wanted Gerry gone right before his death. I think what seals this idea is when Roman walks in to make his call to Matsson and Gerry hurriedly ends her phone call. If she was on the phone with anyone who was supposed to know the situation she wouldn’t have ended the call so fast and awkwardly walked out of the room while Roman was trying to get her to give him sympathy.

I'll go first. I think CBT is a fine tool, but the only reason it's psychotherapy's go-to research backed technique is because it is 1. easily systematized and replicable, and 2. there is an easier way to research it, so 3. insurance companies can have less anxiety and more certainty that they aren't paying for nothing. However, it is simply a bandaid on something much deeper. It teaches people to cope with symptoms instead of doing the more intuitive and difficult work of treating the cause. Essentially, it isn't so popular because its genuinely the most effective, but rather because it is the technique that fits best within our screwed up system. 

Curious to see what kind of radical takes other practicing therapists hold!

598,My ex wife finally started therapy. I'm not happy for her at all.,5054,16pue71,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/16pue71/my_ex_wife_finally_started_therapy_im_not_happy/,546,"My ex wife and I had a dramatic four years of marriage, to say the least. I don't want to look like I'm pointing the finger at her, but she was legitimately the cause of 99% of our marriage issues.

Over these four years, I must have told her that she needed therapy dozens of times. I begged. I pleaded. I even called a therapist, described her symptoms, and asked the therapist if she could help. She said that she sounds like she needs a consultation.

My wife still refused.

When my wife lost her mind and shrieked at me for an hour because I left a pen on the table ""in the wrong place,"" I asked her to go to therapy. She refused.

When my wife missed my father's funeral because she was so absorbed in her smartphone that she simply forgot, leaving me alone on one of the worst days of my life, I asked her to go to therapy. She refused.

When my wife shouted at me on a crowded train and I had to pretend I didn't know her to save myself from the humiliation, I asked her to go to therapy. She refused.

The last straw was six months ago. My wife started a fight with two men in public because they were smoking. I tried to deescalate, my wife had to just have *one more word* (about five times). I tried to pull her away and she spat at them. This led to a physical altercation in which I broke two ribs. My wife had locked herself in the car as they beat me up. From my hospital bed, I finally told my wife that if she wanted to stay married, she would have to get therapy. She refused. She chose divorce.

Our divorce was finalized a month ago. We're still going over several major financial points. Today we had people coming by to see our old house. After they checked it out for a good thirty minutes and left, she told me that she had to go to an appointment. Out of curiosity I asked what for, to which she responded that she was seeing a therapist.

At first I was happy. But then she added ""Tim convinced me to go.""

Tim. The guy she has been seeing for a couple of months, since we separated. The dog trainer trainer, if I'm recalling his profession correctly. In four years, dozens of witnessed meltdowns, public humiliation and two broken ribs, I could not do what Tim did in under 60 days. 

I have no idea what he has that I don't. But now I'm sitting here, likely feeling worse than I did at any point in our marriage. Why didn't she try to salvage things with me? Why did she care so little?",1695441405,therapy

Even when I was put in an inpatient hospitalization program I found ChatGPT to be a better therapist than any real person. If it could prescribe medication to me it would also be a better psychiatrist.

Since the May 24th update it has been no longer responding to my issues. Any time I try to talk mental health with it it tells me to talk to a real person. No real person has ever come remotely close to the help that ChatGPT has been able to provide. I've tried having it pretend it is a  play script that is being written but any time I bring up suicide it entirely shuts down and starts only giving me the canned responses.

I know there is serious liability with allowing ChatGPT to be a therapist, but I'm proof there is also serious harm with removing the amazing therapy they were providing.

It is unlikely I'll be able to respond to this thread as I will be checking myself back into inpatient shortly.",1685112020,therapy

I have been after her for WEEKS to clean it up and she keeps saying ""I'll do it later"". 

I had ENOUGH and told her she cannot go out with friends or her boyfriend until her closet is clean. 

Unfortunately that week she had work and prior commitments at school so only had one free afternoon where she was going to see her therapist (she is in therapy for depression and anxiety). She also was going to go to with her boyfriend's family on a day trip that following weekend. I figured missing that would finally get through to her to get it done after several weeks of constantly putting it off. 

Instead she cancelled her therapy appointment (as it was her only free afternoon) because she didn't want to miss going with her boyfriend this weekend. Her therapist said I was wrong to do this because she needs her therapy and this was a ""dumb hill to die on"" I told her she's been putting this off for weeks and won't listen and I don't know how else to get through to her. I refuse to live like slobs! 

AITA?

EDIT: I didn't tell her ""cancel therapy to clean your closet"" I said ""if you want to go out with your boyfriend or anyone this week closet needs to be clean before then."" I told her how she budgets her time is up to her, just get it done. 

She chose to cancel the appointment to get it done.",1676925850,therapy

I (16f) am the only one in the household who isn't talking about the wedding non-stop. My mom picked up on this a while ago and then she overheard me tell my friend I just wanted it to be over and that I wasn't excited for the wedding. So she asked if we could talk. It was a difficult conversation. I told my mom that I wasn't totally happy about the wedding, that it has been difficult for me, with dad, who died when I was 10, being gone and some things that have been said. I told her I was so glad she was happy and I know Charles helped bring her back to herself. The conversation highlighted that I don't see Charles and his kids as my family and that I'm unsure if I'll ever consider them in that way.

Some (maybe) relevant info to some of my feelings: When Charles and his kids moved in first, he took me out for pizza and told me he doesn't want us to be a blended family, he wants us to be just a family. And he doesn't want to be my stepdad. He wants to be my dad. He said he would do everything for me that he does for his kids and would be there for me always. He said we could start trialing out some dad names for me to call him. I told him I already have a dad and the sentiment was nice and all but I was going to be his stepkid. He really challenged me on why I could only have one dad and why I didn't want one. It was very uncomfortable for me. He and his kids also tagged along when mom and I went to remember dad on his anniversary, at the diner we went to as a family. His kids talked non-stop about the wedding and we didn't actually get to talk about dad. Then Charles declared we'd make it a family thing every year and even when mom was like let's just see, he was like it will be good for bonding. I didn't like that at all. It was the first time where I went and did a solo thing to remember dad because I hated every second of the diner experience.

Mom wanted us to explore this in family therapy and I asked for it to be just her and me. She was going to say no and then she asked why. I told her I would open up more with just her and a therapist and that I would rather make sure we're okay, than work on trying to bond me to others right now. I told her I could see that she was hurting that I felt the way I do and I didn't want our relationship to be ruined by this. Mom agreed for therapy to be just me and her.

We start next week. But Charles doesn't like that I wanted it to be just mom and me. I think he was a little offended that I feel this way in the first place and then to not want to include him and his kids in family therapy. Mom told him she wished it could be all of us. But she didn't want to push me away or waste money by taking us all if I would find it difficult to open up around them. Charles told me I was putting my mom in a bad place and I was selfish and he has only ever tried to show me he loves me and will be my dad happily.

When I decided to get therapy, friends patted me on the back for overcoming the barrier of the stigma that comes with it, for taking the ""brave step"" of getting help.

I honestly don't give a fuck about the stigma. Therapy is so goddamn expensive. Insurance doesn't cover it a lot of the time. Even the therapists my insurance will cover, it's still a $60 copay, that's still 240 dollars a month.

So many people say things like ""Everyone should get therapy! Therapy is great! I encourage YOU to get therapy!"" It's like they think that we don't already *want* therapy. A lot of us *want* therapy, or desperately *need* it. We just can't justify the expense. I get it. It's all coming from a place of good intentions, but it's frustrating to hear.

I'm finally at a place where I can afford it. They are correct. Therapy is awesome. I really could have used this when I had the financial stress and anxiety of being in college. I'm barely justifying spending this kind of money now, at 60 dollars a week, but I thought it'd be a healthy way to help me get through COVID.

The way my daughter (Alana, 26) talks about me in therapy, you'd think I'd never done anything good for her at all. I get it. I fucked up. But it's like I told the therapist when he asked me how my daughter's words made me feel: ""I'm not trying to shift any blame, but my wife is right here and my daughter hasn't said one bad word about her this entire time. Is this goijg to be family therapy or bash Dad for an hour and forty-five minutes every week?""

He told me that, that uncomfortable feeling I felt and that frustration was how my daughter has been feeling for all these years.

That was the first session. We're on session three. I've been listening and all I hear is a lot whole of ""Daddy this"" and ""Daddy that"" and I'm ready to call it quits and throw in the towel. I told my wife that she could go to the sessions without me from now on and she can listen to my daughter complain about me all they want because obviously if she hates me that much, it's better if I stay away.

My wife said that if I stopped going that would make me an AH because this isn't about me and that we're there to support our daughter in her healing process.

I said that was easy for her to say because she's not the one getting targeted every week and if this isn't about me (too) then this isn't *family* therapy and I should just remove myself if I'm the cause of all the problems.

I'm having doubts though because I did neglect our daughter a lot when she was little, and I do want a better relationship with her, but if I have to keep going through this? Fuck no.",1640560430,therapy

749,"YSK: OCD is a serious, debilitating mental disorder and should not be treated lightly or as a quirk",2566,174uiz9,YouShouldKnow,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/174uiz9/ysk_ocd_is_a_serious_debilitating_mental_disorder/,146,"Why YSK: It's OCD awareness week, and it's another good time to bring awareness to what is frequently one of the most misunderstood mental disorders.

OCD stands for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it is a disorder characterized by unwanted thoughts and fears entering a person's mind, which usually compels them to perform rituals or compulsions in order to rid themselves of the associated anxiety from the thoughts.

Although instances of such behavior do occur in most people, those with the disorder experience these instances far more frequently and more intensely than others.

Although a large percentage of people have heard about the disorder, some the three biggest misconceptions about it are:

1. it is inherently or overwhelmingly linked to cleanliness, orderliness, or tidiness obsessions
2. It is a relatively light and easy-to-manage disorder in comparison to other serious mental health conditions
3. The repeated thoughts, feelings, and urges that enters a person with OCD's mind are because, at least in part, they have some desire to act on their fears, or it aligns with their values

All three points listed are untrue. OCD can take the form of any obsession imaginable (obsessions over certain things are usually referred to as OCD themes or sub-types), and it is unclear whether cleanliness obsessions are even the most common sub-type. In terms of the internal stress it produces, cases of severe OCD are similar to severe cases of PTSD and Schizophrenia, which are generally treated as very serious disorders (which they should be, of course.)

And lastly, the person experiencing the thoughts and fears does so precisely because they do NOT like or want them. If anything, a person's OCD about say, harming their family (a common sub-type) makes them less likely to do so than otherwise.

A list of the most common OCD sub-types can be found below. I would encourage people to read the link, as it may be able to help you identify the disorder in yourself or others, which can lead people to recovery much quicker and easier:

There are multiple disorders that can overlap in symptoms. Some are like autism except it’s developed over time and not something you’re born with. 

These people decide they have autism and just go with it regardless of what professionals say. Guess what, masking doesn’t hide it that well. If they say you don’t have it, you probably don’t.

Since I was little, I could never sit still doing the same activity for a long time. I've always lived with this, because I thought it was something normal and part of my personality. Throughout my adolescence, the problem intensified more and more to the point of not being able to make a mathematical calculation that required greater effort. Soon, I asked my mother(32F) to make an appointment with a psychiatrist.  
  
After the consultation, I found out that I had ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and that I should not only buy expensive medication for my treatment, but also start therapy.  
  
To help with my treatment, I asked my father(43M), who has been separated from my mother for many years, for help with my treatment, in addition to informing him of my situation.  


He casually looked at me and said, ""I already knew you had ADHD."" I was extremely confused, until he said ""I have ADHD too and you showed signs of it from a very young age"". He soon said that he was waiting for the right moment to take me to the consultation, as I was in a growth phase and could very well be something else, such as ""hyperactivity and lack of concentration typical of youth"". I was furious, I felt betrayed, this was something that not even my own mother (who stayed with him for more than 5 years) knew. I had a tense discussion with him, telling him that if he had put me on treatment earlier, I could be doing better in my studies and in my life in general.

There came a point where I couldn't contain myself and screamed ""You are a piece of shit!"". He was silent for a few seconds and said that he never wanted to see my face again, and that I had deeply disappointed him.

After that, my stepmother(34F) called me saying that I had hurt him, and that I had better apologize, as I was extremely insensitive and rude to him, and called him something terrible. My mother, on the other hand, took my side and said that I had done nothing wrong, and that she was equally impacted that my father had hidden this, not only from me, but from her as well.  
  
Although I consider myself right, after all, to try to hide a mental disorder from someone throughout their childhood and adolescence. Not only is it morally wrong, it's also a health hazard. Despite that, I also think I took my father too seriously. He has the same disorder as I do, and he comes from a time when this problem was not valued and treated as it should. He was diagnosed when he was in the army and he thought I could handle my disorder well into adulthood.

It's not a cute and quirky mental disorder that makes me spaz out, nor is it something people wish they had, nor is it something you should be fucking pushing aside like it's something that most people go through and have. It's a fucking awful mental disorder that ruins every aspect of my adult life if I let it.

If I'm not on meds I feel like a total piece of shit who can't even get out of bed to go shower. Starting any task regardless of how menial it is creates so much mental stress I have panic attacks. I forget what I'm doing all the time, and my mind can't stay on a single subject for more than 10 minutes max. I'm either eating 10,000 calories a day or not eating for days on end because sometimes I just don't feel like it. I can't keep a schedule, I can't do things consistently, my life is a constant total mess. It doesn't matter how many therapists I talk to, how many books I read, I can never get this shit under control.

Adderall is considered a street drug in college, and for some reason, people just assume it magically solves all my problems, and yeah maybe for normal people Adderall would solve a lot of their problems, but for a neurodivergent it just allows me to get out of bed without wanting to cry.

Want to know the worst thing? Most people just think it's some silly kid's disease that will get better when you grow older. It fucking doesn't, in fact, it gets worse especially if your parents decided not to act upon any of the problems when you're a kid. People on tik-tok are pretending to have it as if it makes them cute and not suicidal and depressed. I can't turn it off, and I can't do shit about it if it decides to act up and have a ""moment"" suddenly.

The upsides to having this disease is so minuscule to me, and the amount of shit I go through living with it is not worth having it.

tl;dr ADHD fucking sucks, and living with it is not something people should want.

EDIT: just for clarification (if the post didn't portray this enough) I do have depression, and I am on anti-depressents. I understand my feelings and thoughts towards ADHD are extremely negative, and that others who are similar can find peace in themselves. Though I've struggled with depression for many years, it's only been in the past year that I've come to terms with having ADHD and what that entails. A lot of my personal depression and anxiety stems from byproducts of having ADHD, and the issues I have relating to it. I do have a therapist, and I am working through my issues, but the point of this post was to say how annoying it is not only from a personal standpoint, but also a social. 

I feel that if I was able to work on the ADHD sooner in my life, and not at the start of my adult life, I would have been able to cope, and live with it better. I also wrote most of this at a point in time where I was pretty upset. 

I've improved, but jesus it's hard work.  


**SUPER IMPORTANT PSA:**  
Since this post gained traction I'll put this here. Please for the love of god if you're young, or have kids who you think show signs of being on the spectrum, have ADHD, or any related mental health issues, please get them treatment now instead of later, and not just the drugs, but actual therapy to develop coping skills.

Why is it that you can be born with a sexual attraction to your same sex, and that is accepted (or becoming more accepted) in our society today.  It is not considered a mental disorder by the DSM.  But if you have a sexual attraction to children or inanimate objects, then you have a mental disorder and undergo psychotherapy to change.

I am not talking about the ACT of these sexual attractions.  I get the issue of consent.  I am just talking about their EXISTENCE.  I don't get how homosexuality can be the only variant from heterosexual attraction that is ""normal"" or something you are ""born"" into.  Please explain.

EDIT:  Can I just say that I find it absolutely awesome that there exists a world where there can be a somewhat intellectual discussion about a sensitive topic like this?

EDIT2:  I see a million answers of ""well it harms kids"" or ""you need to be in a two way relationship for it to be normal, which homosexuality fulfills"".  But again, I am only asking about the initial sexual preference.  No one knows whether their sexual desires will be reciprocated.  And I think everyone agrees that the ACT of pedophilia is extraordinarily harmful to kids (harmful to everyone actually). So why is it that some person who one day realizes ""Hey, I'm attracted to my same sex"" is normal, but some kid who realizes ""Hey, I'm attracted to dead bodies"" is mental?  Again, not the ACT of fulfilling their desire.  It's just the attraction.  One is considered normal, no therapy, becoming socially acceptable.  One gets you locked up and on a registry of dead animal fornicators. 

EDIT3:  Please read this one:  What about adult brother and sister?  Should that be legal?  Is that normal?  Why are we not fighting for more brother sister marriage rights?  What about brother and brother attraction?  (I'll leave twin sister attraction out because that's the basis for about 30% of the porn out there).",1375230184,mental_disorder

According to Wikipedia (ha, yes, I know, but it's hard to find unbiased sources on this subject), ""GID is classified as a disorder by the ICD-10 CM but was reclassified as gender dysphoria by the DSM-5. Some transgender people and researchers support declassification of GID because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance, reinforces the binary model of gender, and can result in stigmatization of transgender individuals. The official reclassification as gender dysphoria in the DSM-5 may help resolve some of these issues, because the term gender dysphoria applies only to the discontent experienced by some persons resulting from gender identity issues.""

I have read studies, articles, and a multitude of opinion pieces on this subject, and I have come to the conclusion that gender dysphoria may in fact be a mental disorder... but that's okay. In fact, it is better for transgender individuals IF their condition is considered a mental disorder. Why? Because due to the new label of ""gender dysphoria"" and the removal of the term GID from most mental disorder manuals, many insurance companies will no longer pay for medical procedures related to gender dysphoria, as it is no longer classified as a mental disorder, but rather a cosmetic procedure. This is problematic because sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is a very expensive--and a very necessary--procedure for transgender individuals to undergo. Unlike mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar depression, therapy and medication have been proven mostly ineffective for treating GID.

Why are medical professionals suddenly against classifying GID as a mental disorder? A few reasons. 1) the social stigma against mental disorders, which can cause stress and depression in transgender individuals, 2) transgender persons' adamant refusal of their condition being a mental disorder, and 3) the fact that much of the stress transgender individuals feel stems from their environment rather than from the condition itself. 

In reference to number 3, it is impossible to determine if ALL transgender individuals experience stress purely based on social stigma, especially considering how gender dysphoria is defined by many transgender people: strong and persistent discomfort with one's biological sex. This extreme state of dysphoria would not disappear if gender dysphoria were accepted socially. That is, if the descriptions I have read in articles and on Tumblr are accurate depictions of the experience.

I'm posting this here because believing that gender dysphoria is a mental disorder is controversial, and I'm not sure how popular this belief is anymore. I obviously have no problem with transgender individuals, and I do think that SRS is the best possible treatment for the condition, but I'm adamant to dismiss its categorization of ""mental illness"" because, unlike, homosexuality, it cannot be observed in nature (since other animals do not perform gender like we do), and it CAN mentally harm the person suffering from it. Whether it's a born or developed trait is irrelevant since other mental disorders can be both born and environmentally shaped.

**EDIT:** Quite a few users have pointed out to me that the terms ""gender dysphoria"" and ""transgender"" are not mutually exclusive, and I agree. I had forgotten that ""transgender"" was now more of an umbrella term to encompass a variety of different mental states and statuses. To clarify my original point, when I say ""gender dysphoria"" or ""transgender"" in the context of my argument, I am referring to a person who feels uncomfortable with their biological sex. This can oftentimes result in stress, anxiety, depression, and even suicide. ""Mental disorder"" refers to ""a diagnosis by a mental health professional of a behavioral or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life."" I feel that the symptoms often described in trans individuals correlate directly to some type of mental health issue, hence my post. It is not ""normal"" to feel that your mental state of gender contradicts your biological state of sex. Is that inherently wrong or immoral? Of course not. At least not in my opinion. But you cannot deny that it is abnormal, just as depression is considered abnormal. Many transpeople are opposed to the term mental disorder because it carries a negative connotation. I say so what? Let's destigmatize mental illness, and we'll be living in a much better world. We all have issues.

Rarely anyone recognized how disabling ADHD is to our everyday lives and how differently we have to go about our normal days just to catch up to NTs. We're casted away as lazy. ADHD is only viewed as hyperactivity and not being able to focus. No one ever talks about things like emotional dysregulation or executive dysfunction. 

Let's face it. Most people don't see ADHD as a disorder that has a big impact on someone's life.

Now, as a cis man, I had long hair throughout most of my 20's because I was a rocker dude and it had nothing to do with my gender identity. And plenty of women had and have short hair. You can have whatever hair and be whatever gender.

So, the alternatives - if the experience of being trans for the person who would make a statement like that was just some type of lifestyle choice, then people generally don't get suicidal about the hair details of their lifestyle choices. If being trans is just about just *being* a certain gender, perhaps one other than the one you were assigned at birth, then it also doesn't seem to follow that your hairstyle would be something so critical, as cis men and women generally do not find having long or short hair respectively a core need associated with their gender status to the point of suicidal ideation.

OTOH, if we instead say gender dysphoria is a mental disorder much like anorexia is, wherein someone might be 90 pounds but still feel unbearably fat in their body, to the point that they feel they cannot exist as they are, that seems to match up far better. Anorexia is of course a terrible disorder deserving of empathy, lack of stigma, and effective treatment, so perhaps too should gender dysphoria be. But as some desire to get away from wanting to call gender dysphoria a mental disorder, symptoms like the one I described just don't seem to gel with that. It seems clear to me we should be still thinking of it as a mental disorder, with hormonal and surgical treatments being exactly that (and with much evidence that those things can indeed be effective treatment).

I'm curious to see if people here think that makes sense, or if they have other perspectives.

I haven't seen anyone put together a *written* guide for this fight so I thought I'd give it a medium-effort go. I'll try to update this with other peoples' tips and tricks if there's some significant contributions.

# Why You Should Complete This Content

The reward for this fight is the **Prayermark of Enmity,** quite a nice accessory with +84 to STR/INT/DEF/MND and a rather nice effect that gives +7% damage *to* non-gods and -7% damage *from* non-gods. Notice that's all ""damage"", meaning (I believe) that it should apply to physical, magical, effective, and special damage. Very good offensive and defensive boost for most content and on all units!

# Battle TL;DR

* Giant Shield, Giant Killing, God Shield, God Slayer, Holy Wall, Dark Shield, Special Shield *and* dark resistance gear *and* dark-resist/boss-resist Arks are your keys to success. As many of these as you can get with your Arks. Need to look those up? Use [Lake's Goldmine](https://www.lastcloudia-goldmine.com/).
* There's a 10 minute *total* time limit and you need to beat both phases of the fight within it.
* The boss has gobs of HP. Because of the time limit you can't just outlast him and chip away - you need some good damage units. Thankfully the boss is weak to all elements, so you have a lot of freedom in who you bring.
* Spirit Maiden Theria, as always, goes the distance on this fight with her Holy Wall II, Magic Castle II, her Crimson Ore-purchase-able anti-flinch robe with built-in dark resistance and MP regen, and her heals (that, thanks to the robe, she can throw out during the incredibly frustrating 10+ second magic barrages in phase 2). I'm sure you can do it without her, but it's gonna be more intensive to gear everyone *else* as a result. Read on to maximize chances for success...
* **Do not bring Weak.** The boss is immune to it, but your supports will cast it over and over and over again, draining their MP very rapidly and probably costing you the fight. Nasty little oversight...

# Phase 1: Lougseus and Mechagods

In this phase Lougseus starts off totally invincible and you're swarmed by a bunch of ""Mechagods"" (Physruin, Magiloss, Theraputikos, and Devitagone) that will periodically form into pairs with blue beams passing between them, damaging everyone standing in the area of the beams. It seems that you need to kill all of the Mechagods to damage Lougseus. All of them are God type, have immunity to all status ailments, and are neutral to all elements. They can all be damaged easily by physical attacks, so no big deal. Bringing some strong physical units with wide-area attacks will make short work of them and make it possible to deal damage to Lougseus directly. Do be aware that the Mechagods will heal themselves periodically.

Once the Mechagods are down you can go nuts on Lougseus himself, who has **35% weakness to all elements** but is immune to all status ailments. ""Weak"" doesn't seem to work, and it seems you can only have one elemental type ""Circle"" on him at a time, but with resists these bad it doesn't matter much.

This phase-1 Lougseus is quite beefy, so despite his low resists he will take a while to kill. That's a problem, because the clock is ticking. If you take too long, **Mechagods will respawn and they will burst heal Lougseus back to full if you fail to kill the Mechagods quickly**. After a little while in this phase, Lougseus will start spamming some nasty dark-themed Galaxy-style spell on the entire field, which isn't hugely damaging but will still cause problems if you're not built for enough magic and dark resistance.

There is no gimmick to Lougseus in this first phase and he isn't really a threat. In the end the first phase is basically a damage/gear check. If phase 1 is a problem for you, you probably should go back to the drawing board or skip because phase 2 is wayyyyy less kind.

# Phase 2: Lougseus, but for real this time.

Now on to the real fight. If you took more than about 3 minutes to clear the first phase, you're probably not going to be able to beat the clock here. No Mechagods or other adds will bother you in this fight, it's just a very straightforward ""let's kill a god"" bruising battle. You just need to get his HP down to zero and you win, simple as that. However, there are three HUGE differences in the second phase that you need to build around:

1. **The Magic Attack.** Lougseus will use an *incredibly long* (10+ seconds) dark magic attack that looks like an evil version of galaxy. This spell doesn't hit very hard but it hits a *lot,* it flinches you, it lasts for a really long time, and Lougseus just loves to come out of it into his Special. We'll talk about this more, below. But speaking of the special...
2. **The Special Attack.** Lougseus has a *really nasty* special, resembling a scaled-up version of the playable Lougseus' S3 skill - he brings back his sword, and then slams it down doing an enormous number of hits to the entire party. This also appears to be dark based, but it's now special damage instead of magic damage. Whee!
3. **The Giga Dispel.** Lougseus will sometimes cast Giga Dispel on the party, wiping out all your buffs. Naturally he loves to do this late in the fight and, worst case, right between the magic attack and the special, potentially taking down all your survival buffs. Watch out for it, and if you see it you may have only a second or two to try and get critical buffs back up.

You will need to be able to survive several of *each* of these nasty attacks unless you are very fast or have some good breakers with you that can consistently stop him from getting these moves off. I didn't personally go the breaking route, I just built for bulk and relied on Spirit Maiden Theria's *insane* utility in this battle. If you don't have SM Theria, honestly you might be better trying to bring a breaker, but what do I know...

**The magic attack:** Even with very high resists to both Dark and Magic, this thing hits like a (slow moving) freight train. The hits keep coming, flinching the entire party and draining HP very quickly. You need a lot of bulk to survive this. SM Theria is *clutch* here - the robe allows her to avoid flinching from most attacks during magic cast, which means she can toss out Starlight Heal *during the spell* to top everyone off. Other healers can do it too, of course, with anti-flinch gear, so if you don't have SM Theria then slap Starlight Heal onto your bestie and get to it. You may have to cast Starlight Heal *two or more times* during the spell (yes, it really is that insanely long). **You want to come out of the magic attack almost fully healed, or you risk a wipe**. See below.

**The special attack:** This is a more straightforward attack and also far more dangerous. Since it's a special, you can't act while its going off - no midway heals for you. Your team is either going to survive it or they are going to wipe. You'll find out pretty fast either way. But that's not the most evil part of this attack - the most evil part is that Lougseus likes to trigger it just after the *magic attack* discussed in the previous paragraph. Even for a well-built party, if this special goes off back-to-back with the magic attack and you haven't healed back to full *you are done*. Gone. Game over man, game over!

**The Giga Dispel:** Yeah. Yeahhhhhhhh. You thought you were doing ok because you built your team to survive both the magic attack and the special, right? But that's with buffs! What about without buffs? What exactly triggers this is unclear to me but it *looks like* it's a threshold trigger (please correct me in the thread if you know exactly how this works). Worst case timing is the magic attack goes off, then just as he comes out of the magic attack he casts Giga Dispel and immediately hits you with his special. If that happens, you're probably gonna need to reset and try again.

Got this far? Survived the magic attack back-to-back with a giga-dispel followed up by a special? Noice! If you can manage that, you've got this fight. Just keep slogging away at that HP bar. But watch your healer's MP... that tends to drain pretty hard on the second phase. And watch the timer... remember, you've only got a *total* of 10 minutes to finish *both* phases in one go.

# Survival Tips

Here are some tips to help you build for and survive this fight:

* The boss is a boss. Thus you have some great passives:
   * Defensive: Giant Shield (sadly locked behind a UR ark), Armor Boost, Armor High Boost
   * Offensive: Giant Killing, Giant Killing II, Giant Killing III, Giant Purge, Wicked Weave
* The boss is also a God, so there are more passives to consider:
   * Defensive: God Shield
   * Offensive: God Buster, God Geyser, God Killer, God Slayer.
* Incoming damage needs to be mitigated. It's mostly (all?) dark but you need to care about both magical and special damage.
   * Generic magic defense spells: Magic Castle, Magic Castle II (better). If you don't have the party-wide versions you're stuck with single-target Magic Barrier and High Magic Barrier. And of course Metis and Metis Phaser (better).
   * Generic magic defense passives: Auto Magic Barrier could save you if you get hit with Giga Dispel. Aside from that of course the usual MND +x% passives, but I didn't use any and you probably should spend your SC on the rest of this list instead.
   * Dark defense spells: Holy Wall, Holy Wall II (better).
   * Dark defense passives: Dark Shield.
   * Special defense: Special Shield I and II (stackable). Sadly Special Shield II is locked behind a UR ark, and it makes a pretty huge difference... Hey Aidis, can we get another source for that one please?
* Gear
   * Anything that gives Dark Resist is a huge win. Prioritize this above all other gear effects. I recommend you take your armor slot and both accessories as the highest possible Dark resistance gear you've got. Use [Lake's Goldmine](https://www.lastcloudia-goldmine.com/) to look up the best options.
   * I did not see any status effects in this fight so I believe it's ok for you to completely ignore status resistance - thus you can take gear purely for resists and not worry about anything else.
* Arks
   * Lots of options here but in general, you want to take **defensive** arks that will reduce damage from magic, reduce damage from dark, reduce damage from bosses, and/or reduce damage from specials. Here are some examples of good non-limited SSR options, but it's really up to you:
      * Divine Beast Hunter: Damage from non-human boss monsters -20% (plus some other stuff we don't care about)
      * Golem Core: Light and Dark resistances +20, add magic guard while guarding  (plus some other stuff we don't care about)
      * Ancient Weapon Lougahn: DEF/MND +15%, damage from bosses -15% (plus some other stuff we don't care about)
* Make sure your healer has as many sources of ""cheat death"" as possible - Decoy, Determination, etc. There's a high chance your healer will die. As long as they can come back and slap out a resurrection and a God Heal, you can probably get back on your feet before the next big attack - but this will only save you a limited number of times.
* You can also sacrifice one DPS for a strong breaker and plan to keep the boss broken as much as possible, minimizing the number of times you have to revive.

# My Run

I completed this in 6:37 ([yoink](https://imgur.com/a/g1L2zSg)!) with SM Theria, Megius, and Adel geared as described above. SM Theria was MVP with 65 innate Dark Resist. Megius did the lion's share of the damage but Adel helped out a ton, especially rapidly clearing the Mechagods in Phase 1. Everyone had Special Shield I and II, as well as Dark Shield, God Shield, Giant Shield as a baseline. Everyone wore dark resist gear in every slot, and even still it was not enough to keep Adel alive (died every special).

I will be the first to admit that Special Shield II is a huge deal here, and it's locked behind a UR ark that I got lucky on. I put some notes into the Survival Tips section that should help for folks without better ways to mitigate that Special damage. But my gear and arks are far from optimal, so you might have better options there that could negate the need to bring Special Shield II.

If you have Winry's Apple Pie or Honey Elixir, it is probably worth bringing someone who can spam that on a ""carry"" DPS over and over to make the fight faster. If I go back to the fight for the last 50 crystals I didn't get (clear in under 6:00), that's the only thing I would immediately change - someone to act as a Megius battery.

902,"Hey there! I'm Knifez, author of Despair Island! I got some info and will answer potential questions!",43,ghflho,Totaldrama,https://www.reddit.com/r/Totaldrama/comments/ghflho/hey_there_im_knifez_author_of_despair_island_i/,67,"Uh, hey guys! Its me, [Knifez](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4311772/). I wrote the famous (or infamous, depending on the person) [Despair Island](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10295140/1/Despair-Island) and was recently informed about this subreddit by some friends of mine over on [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net)

I poked around and saw some discussion of my stories over the years, so I thought I'd make this post for a couple of reasons!

1: To answer any questions anyone might have about the story itself or my thought process while writing the story. Ask away! I'll do my best to answer everyone, no matter how tough the question is.

2: To let people know that there is a [one-shot](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11618927/6/What-If) for the second season of Despair Island \[WARNING, MAJOR DESPAIR ISLAND SPOILERS. LIKE, THE BIGGEST SPOILERS POSSIBLE\]. And that the one shot for the Despair Island Pahkitew cast is in the works! I know its not the same as my original idea for three full length seasons, but it's the best I can offer! I hope to have it published soon.

3: To shamelessly plug my most recent Comp story, [Total Drama Generations!](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13315614/1/Total-Drama-Generations) A year or so after TDRR, Things go back to the more mellow setting of Total Drama Island after the low ratings of over-the-top TDAS and TDPI. 6 campers from each generation (no RR characters) are invited back and put onto three teams. It's a formidable cast of both powerhouses and underdogs. Chris is less douchey and evil and more of a teasing jerk like he was in TDI/TDA. Challenges are TDI-esque, tough but not death defying. If anyones interested, check it out! Currently 8 chapters in and receiving pretty consistent updates!

The difference in these posts from previous Fud is the associated tone of depression. Whoever is on the other side of these plays has hit this stage of grief, before acceptance and the hope that their final attempts will work. This will happen to the degree where you too will feel the tension of persuasion in their tone.

The nature of these posts is supposed to make you feel that gamestop Is slowing, that Ryan Cohen has given up (complete bullshit news media slandering), and that the depression is shared. That those who hodl are to feel rushed to make a brash decision when the thought should never have come up in the first place.

Anyone who's been paying attention, even the slightest, knows that GME Is a monolith in navigating a shifting market, capital efficiency, and risk/reward allocations of capital. The company is a snowballing force which is prepared for purchasing while the rest of the market cannot sustain their capital long enough to GROW.

I'm making this post in hopes that the awareness in the sub is still there. As individuals, it's important to protect what you have created. Stand for what is yours and keep the pressure on. You may be doing this alone, but you are not alone. 

Change isn't easy, but it's damn well worth the fight.

If youre a new trader....  please understand you can lose everything in a heartbeat. Dont double down, even if ur down big. Sit on ur hands. Buying more into a vicious decline is how traders lose it all. 

If youve already lost it all.... everything will be ok. Right now u may feel like the world is ending, but it is not. Believe it or not, one day you will have this money back and more. You will feel like absolute shit for awhile but u will be ok.  

If you feel despair/suicidal....  stop, breathe, talk to someone, realize ur not alone. What ur going through is not unique, most new traders lose it all when starting.  Don’t beat yourself up, most of us have been where u are. You will be ok and u will rise again.",1599225840,despair

 **AITA for messing up the closing on our first house? I know I messed up huge but AITA?** 

 My husband and I have been trying to buy our first house for over a year. It’s been insane in this market and we finally found a place that isn’t exactly what we wanted and was $40000 over the asking price. But still it meant we would no longer be paying rent and was only a little over our budget.

We were supposed to close on Monday. I was so excited I wanted to get some a new outfit for the closing. While shopping a saw a bag I absolutely fell in love with and it matched my new outfit perfectly. They did a great job selling me and before I know it I had let the sales ladies convince me that as a new homeowner I deserved nice things. They also talked me into getting a store credit card…with A 20k limit. The bag cost a pretty big chunk of that. I was approved and bought the bag.

What I did not know is that taking out a new credit card is REALLY bad when you are buying a house. We couldn’t close on Monday and since there are like a dozen offers on this house we may lose it while everything is sorted out with our lenders. Also we may lose the $10000 in earnest cash we gave the seller.

I want to throw up I know I messed up so badly it was stupid decision and I was such an idiot for even walking in the store. And this bag may ended up costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars in earnest money and still having to rent (as my husband has told me countless times over the past 4 days).

I know I messed up but AITA?

Edit:  Edit for those still following: the seller is going to give us 5 business days to get financing worked out with lender. Realtor thinks it can be done. Crisis is averted it looks like we will get the house still.

Apparently the sale did go through, as just days later OP was back with:

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uxgwfq/aita_for_draining_our_swimming_pool_to_save_water/) 

 **AITA for draining our swimming pool to save water (we are in a drought state)?** 

So for some backstory, my husband I were able to finally close on our first house last Friday. It came with a very nice pool that I was excited about. My husband had to travel for work immediately after the closing so it was up to me to arrange keys, initial move in, utilities, services, etc…

On Saturday morning we were talking and he said “you know the drought is worse here in California, I know it’s too late now but I’m wondering if we get this bad if it wasn’t a huge mistake to get a house with a pool?” I said I was still excited about the pool and is already laid out by it and gone swimming. He said that he was just thinking out loud and about the future.

The more I thought about it the more I thought maybe he was right so I researched how to drain pools, looked up YouTube videos and went and rented a pump and I drained all the water. The pool is now basically empty.

Well he freaked out when he got home and said that I made a huge mistake because you can’t leave a pool drained. I said I did it to make him happy and that I understood his concerns. He said that he’s so sick of me acting like a “child” that he’s going to hire a babysitter for me while he goes away. Obviously this really hurt my feelings, I’m a nurse for gods sake not a bumbling fool.

I keep trying to explain my point and that I did it to make him happy and he says that if I don’t I understand why he’s upset and don’t get how foolish I was he can’t waste brain power on it.

Was I the asshole here?

Ken Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago (a 220-foot fall that statistically results in death 97% of the time), but the moment he did so, he was hit by a horrifying realization while in mid-air: **""I instantly realized that everything in my life that I had thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped.""**

With that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.

If you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take Baldwin's words to heart - **whatever you may feel in your life is unfixable may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with.** Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.",1671293227,suicidal

•not sure what “before” is, but he says “before,” he used to do nice things for her and hope he would receive something nice back. He thinks this was a “quid pro quo” way of thinking and saw it as a way of “paying” for nice things. “Ill do the dishes or watch the kids, then you won’t be in a bad mood anymore, and then you’ll like me, right? But that’s not how it works.” Dav, it is not selfish to expect your wife and mother of your children to act kind toward you and do nice things for you when you constantly do nice things for her.

•he’s “lucky” he realizes this now because they’re not already 20 years in their marriage.
•Dav talks about conversations they would have that were “devastating” to him, usually about things he did that Bethany didnt like. Specifically, Dav “not celebrating her accomplishments and achievements.”

•so they argue and argue and after trying to “reason” with her and “strain to see it from her POV,” he always ended up admitting he was in the wrong. But Bethany would feel better.

•the next day, typically, he would feel very resentful toward her for putting him in a position where he had to take the fall. This would happen every couple months and started to get worse.

TW: suicidal thoughts below 

•Dav started to have “suicidal fantasies” after that. He said it’s called passive suicidal ideation, where you’re not really going to do it, but just think about it.

•what made his “fantasy compelling” was how bad Bethany would feel if he was no longer there.

•it wasn’t until those thoughts got very “dramatic” that he decided to get therapy.

The therapist from what he said seems like a regular, secular therapist, so good for him. 

Not really sure what to say besides I’m very glad he got help. For both Bethany and Dav’s sakes, and their kids, I hope they find people that make them genuinely happy.",1680740449,suicidal

I just came by to see what people are saying here because of what’s happened to Terra and the ridiculous price action over the last few days. 

I’m not invested here, but after seeing the sentiment on this sub, I wanted to share a story of mine. 

A few years ago, I hit a hot-streak trading stocks. I had initially started with $25k ($12k I took out as a loan from a family member, and $13k of my savings.) 

After a few months of consistent daily gains, I decided to go big. I took a few big risks, and they paid off big time. So much so, that I had turned the $25k into over $170k in the span of a couple months. While this felt amazing, it also drained me of most of my energy and happiness. The amount of stress I put myself through to reach this point had pushed me to the brink of a few mental breakdowns. 

At the time, this amount of money was more cash than I had ever had in my life. It was enough to travel the world, put a down payment on real-estate, open a new business, or even take out my $120k of profits and still have double my initial investment. 

I didn’t do any of these things. I decided that my next moves would propel me to over $1M in a few months. I was not content that I had made more than most people on this planet will ever make, within a very short period of time, and with almost no physical labor. Somehow inside, a part of me felt like I didn’t deserve this money. 

I took even bigger risks than I had taken before, my stress had hit unprecedented levels. I was on a daily roller-coaster of emotion. 

Because of the heightened risk, stress, and most likely very high cortisol levels in my brain, I took a big loss. $20k was my first big loss. On my next trade, I bought-in heavy in after-hours on a penny stock that looked primed to explode. I woke up the next morning up over $20k. “Wow” I thought to myself. I had made back my big loss overnight. But, because I felt like I had made no progress and I had only made back what ‘was already mine,’ I decided to hold it, the next day I woke up only $10k up instead of $20k. Then a few days later I was at a loss again. I had given up the chance to make up my losses overnight, and opted to stress the rest of the week while I watched my profits turn into bigger losses. I held until my loss was so big I couldn’t bear it. The pain was too deep. I lost another $40k. This cycle continued, until my $170k had turned into $7k l, believe it or not. This amount was less than the amount of debt I had racked up buying new things I didn’t need because I felt ‘rich’ at the time my account was big and green. 

Not only that, but I had neglected my actual business, which before I diverted my attention to trading had been on track to become a big success. 

On top of that, I had alienated my friends & loved ones because the stress I put myself through left me so exhausted I did not feel like talking or interacting with anyone. Especially people that would know something was troubling me. 

I spent the next few days thinking of why I didn’t take that overnight $20k profit and moved on. Why I didnt take profits and took that dream trip to Tokyo I had promised myself I would take if I had any success whatsoever trading stocks. Why I let myself piss away $170k I took months shocking my nervous system to make, in less than 1 month. 

All that time, effort, & money. What could have been if I had made the right move instead of the wrong one. I had lost all contact with friends & family, my business was failing due to neglect, I had more debt than cash, and the idea of me having to go through it all again just to get back to a point I had already achieved was defeating. 

I fell into an extremely deep depression. One that I had never experienced before. I saw no tomorrow, no way back from what had happened. I saw no way for me to find happiness again, re-kindle my personal relationships, re-build my wealth, and save my business. 

I felt so hope-depraved that I decided I was going to kill myself. I wrote a note that read “I’m sorry.” Placed it on the nightstand beside my bed. I then counted the amount of Xanax pills I had. 18. I put them all in my mouth at once, had a moment of self-reflection where my happy childhood memories played in my head, I took a glass of water and downed it all. 

I was to go out peacefully. Fall asleep and never wake up. Say goodbye to the pain and regret. Dream forever. 

Thankfully, god had a plan for me. I woke up 3 days later in that same bed. I had no idea what day it was, where I was, or how long it had been. When I realized I was asleep for 3 full days, I was shocked. How close I was to never waking up, or going into a coma, or just becoming a vegetable for the rest of my life. 

I also felt a deep peace, because I had hit the lowest low of my life. Rock-bottom, attempted suicide. Yet, here I was, awake in my bed, in a new day which for some reason felt like a life renewed. I felt ridiculously stupid for considering ending this journey that is my life. An infinite nothingness awaited me, and I had woken up with nothing. Nothing, but all the opportunity this world had to offer. It took a good 2 days for me to stop slurring my words and for the drugs to fully wear off. 

I visited my parents and came-clean with what happened. I told my friends, even my colleagues in my business. I decided that from now on, all I will think about is today. Never tomorrow. Just today. I will do everything in my power to maximize the value of today and put my head down and work as hard as I could everyday, until I somehow felt happy again. 

A few months go by, I had turned my business more successful than ever. What it should have been all along. This success gave me excess cash, I paid off all my debt. This also gave me relief. I started spending money on experiences that enriched my life such as traveling and helping people in need. The good karma must have paid off, because after helping these people not only did I make more money, but I also realized that the true happiness in this life lies in leaving a mark on others, uplifting them, and in-turn uplifting myself. 

Another couple of months go by, I had enough money and courage saved up to give trading another shot. I decided to use $15k and invest it in crypto. Soon this investment had turned into $40k, I re-invested it 2 more times and it turned into $340k. This all happened within 6 months of me losing the $170k. 

This is when I realized that $170k was not wasted or lost. It was an investment in the most valuable lesson I’ve ever learned. It’s not over until I decide it’s over. The steepest low is just a spring for my next high. Even if I had lost that $340k, I knew it wouldn’t matter, because it’s just money and part of the experience that is life, and there is always a way back. 

Ever since then, I’ve had very high ups, and very low downs, but the top of every mountain was the bottom of the next. While, I’ve experienced extreme sadness and disappointments along the way since then, I will always know that NOTHING, especially money, would push me to end my life early. After all, I had never existed before, I get 60-80 years of existence if I’m lucky, and then I won’t exist anymore for eternity. This drop in the proverbial ocean of time that represented my life was mine. I was in control. I will enjoy the experience no matter if its positive or negative because to just experience it at all is a miracle in itself. 

If you’re considering ending your life, I sincerely hope you re-consider your feelings. Whatever it is you’re going through, like everything else in life that ever was, shall pass. A brighter day will come, and you will be surprised how life will open its doors back up for you when you allow it to.",1652239839,suicidal

* Olaf wants to die in battle

* Aatrox wants to die to get rid of his existence

* Yorick wants to die because oh my god let this man have a break

* Soraka materialized a weak dematerializing mortal body just because she wanted to help Runeterra. It's unclear if her ""spirit"" actually dies when the body is gone but we can interpret as such.

* Morgana doesn't want to die right now, but she sure wishes she could.

**Depressed**

* Riven suffers from intense PTSD and guilt since her early adulthood I assume

* Vex can be interpreted as just teenage drama but the sadness and apathy is definetely real to her

* Ahri has been without a family for a long time, and killed everyone she got close to, choosing to isolate herself.

* Amumu.

**Speculation**

* LeBlanc suffers from identity crisis and there's so much of her running around that she probably demanded an assassination of herself at some point (don't know if that counts)

* Lulu ""time travelled"" so hard that all her family and friends are already dead, I would be crazy like her too (not sure if this is old lore)

* Lucian dedicated his whole life in grief for his wife, and then suddenly she appears and he still feels empty because she's not the same anymore, his quest was kind of in vain.

Around Christmas time 2018, i was going through a shitty time in life, being 15 not making it easy, and when it all pushed me over the edge, i had threatened to commit suicide, as i was having a huge panic attack and i didn't know what to do. My mom was really calm about the whole thing and it really helped me out. We drove down to a Lutheran General that was about a mile away, and after a good hour and a half of waiting, we finally got situated, and i got a ""holding cell."" My assigned nurse at the time was really funny, and really helped me stay calm.

&#x200B;

The night was long AF! I had gotten there around 11:30 at night so we were already tired, and i fell asleep in the hospital bed at around 1:30 or so, only to be woken just an hour later, for blood testing. It wasn't that bad, i just couldnt function at all. After a long night, i finally woke up for real, around 1:40ish in the afternoon. They told me that i would have to transfer to another hospital with other kids who are going through similar things as me. It took another 45 minutes before the ambulance arrived, and a stretcher rolled up to my room. Now this is where the entitled bitch came in. 

&#x200B;

As i was walking out of my room to the stretcher, the EMTs were talking to my parents and the nurse, and i was waiting for them when i heard this. 

&#x200B;

EM: Here's your ride EK! 

she promptly plops her kid on the stretcher, and the adults are so busy, and halfway down the hall so i say.

ME: The hell are you doing?

i didnt mean to be rude at all, i was just tired and not in the mood for anything at all

EM gasped and laid her kid down on it. 

EM: What is wrong with you???

ME: Please stop yelling, my head hurts really bad.

EM respectfully quiets down

ME: Why are you on my stretcher anyways?

This was clearly the wrong thing to say as she starts screaming,

EM: YOUR STRETCHER?!?

ME: jesus christ, what happened to being quiet.

EM: THIS IS NOT YOUR STRETCHER!!!

at this point the adults are walking back, hearing the commotion, and at this point i was just sitting down on the floor holding my head in my hands. 

EMT: What's going on?

EM: This boy is taking our stretcher!

EMT: Yeah, because its FOR him.

EM gasped and held her precious.

EM: There is NO way that this brat is more important then EK, whats wrong with him.

My mom, trying to get this bitch to think told her, against the emt's advice earlier.

Mom: BECAUSE HE WANTED TO KILL HIMSELF AND THEY'RE FINDING HIM HELP YOU BITCH!

I had never heard her yell or swear like that, and it definitely caught me off guard.

EM: So what?

My mom exploded, yelling a whole shit ton of stuff at the EM, with the EK starting to cry

EM: Stop it you monster! (yes, thats what she said)

ME: Only when you get out of our lives and get off the damn stretcher!

&#x200B;

The EM quiet downed and grabbed her kid, pulling him off the stretcher. I slowly got up, and the EMT helped me into the stretcher, before i knew it, we were on the ambulance, and i was barely awake. and thank god, it was late enough for the staff to let me sleep for a while. Now i thought that was it, but on day 4, there was a new kid arriving, and he seemed strikingly familiar. He looked like the kid from the other hospital, but years older. During some free time, i whispered across the halls (which was against the rules) and asked him about it. Turns out it was his mom, and his younger brother who did that. We laughed about it, and 3 days later, during a family session, my name was called, and i waved goodbye, discharged and gone for good.

Edit1: a lot of people are asking if I’m ok now, I am. I got out the Sunday before Christmas and I spent the following week in Georgia with family

Edit2: JESUS CHRIST!! 3.5K upvotes and silver?!?

I don’t want attention, I’m posting this to hopefully raise awareness. Everyone now a days seems to joke about suicide like it isn’t a big deal and is just whatever. Suicide is very real and very very heart breaking. 

I’m still trying to compose my thoughts and calm down but I can’t. The last 10 hours for me have been absolute hell and full of tears, heart break, mental breakdown and so much more I can’t even describe it. You see those stories on the internet (such as this) about how heart breaking and difficult it is to lose someone to suicide but you never know how it feels until you lose a loved one to suicide. This is the worst pain I’ve ever felt, it’s worse than losing a loved one to a tragic accident imo. knowing that my friend chose to take his life is such a different kind of pain and sorrow. 

Please guys, keep an eye out for the warning signs even things as small as suicidal “jokes”. I wish I noticed the warning signs and paid more attention to them. 

There’s always help for anyone in need of it. Things always get better, taking your life should never be an option on the table 

I miss my friend so much and I know god has a good angel up there with him.

It's baffling how many times you hear the family or friends of someone say ""But they were so happy! We never knew!"" It's important to know these things, especially for the sake of your friends or children. 

Note: I'm not a psychologist, but I've been there before many times. These aren't all the signs, and everyone is different.

-Giving away possessions or passwords. 

-Suddenly being happy/positive after a bad depressive episode.

-An overabundance of suicide jokes/gestures (i.e. putting a finger gun to the head or miming cutting the wrists).

-Isolation and ghosting.

-A flurry of messages, whether by mouth, phone, email, etc. of how much you mean to them.

-Changing language (ex. saying ""goodbye"" instead of the usual ""see you later"").

-Dangerous behavior (if I die, I die).

-Hopeless responses to questions (ex. When asked ""Are you okay?"" They answer ""I don't know"").

-Trying to push loved ones away by being mean.

-Talking excessively about death.

-Disassociating or appearing to be ""spaced out"".

-Suddenly treating their loved ones to fun dates and experiences in order to make final good memories.

-Self harm.

-Nihilistic responses (i.e. ""Nothing matters anymore"").

-Sharp decline in mental health (not eating, not smiling, being tired, etc.).

-Asking how you'd feel if they suddenly disappeared. 

If you think someone might be suicidal, ASK them if they are. Ask them straight up if they're having suicidal thoughts. Be there for them, let them know you can be a shoulder to cry on, and most importantly, believe them when they tell you they're struggling.

EDIT: More signs include...

-Lack of hygiene. 

-Self deprecating language and behavior.

-Sleeping all day or not sleeping at all. 

-Thanking loved ones for being there, supporting them, etc.

-Asking questions about death (ex. ""How many tylenol do you think would kill someone?"")

-Suddenly becoming extremely depressed.

-Being caught will pills/a knife/etc. in their room (this one is for your kids. Take this very, very seriously).

-Refusing to accept that things will be better or that someone cares about them.

-Apologizing suddenly for any past altercations as if they want to end things on a positive note.

-Not being interested in ANYTHING anymore. This includes hobbies, the future, others' concerns, religion, and more.

-Crying a lot.

-Apathy (feeling nothing).",1571169536,suicidal

About 6 months ago my husband had a new coworker (F27) join his team. My husband (M29) and I (F25) have been married for 2 years, but were dating for 4 years. My husband doesn’t get along with most men because he doesn’t like “locker room talk” and it’s one of the reasons I respected him. He’s kind, has healthy hobbies, and has loved me. It has been wonderful being with him. 

Then everything changed when she arrived. Let’s call her Tara. The first day they met they exchanged numbers and added each other to social media. Within the first week, we did a double date for me to meet her and her boyfriend of 2 years, Tyler. Tara cannot drink alcohol due to claiming to be allergic. The weeks following were fun and nice but after a while, it began where almost every single night we were eating out with them. My husband, Brandon, is a wonderful cook and makes most of the meals at home and I always clean the rest of the house. At this point it had been weeks since we had a meal at home. I know this because I had to throw away food that went bad and our fridge looked like a bachelor’s because it became just drinks and sauces. 

We argued after a while because I didn’t want to eat out anymore because my social battery had run out. It was wake up, go to work, immediately go out to dinner, go home, shower, go to bed. For weeks. He agreed and promised to only schedule dinners out to twice a week. That lasted a week. I kept going because he would pick me up from work and then we would go. I started it get annoyed because I do not like seafood and she would always suggest seafood restaurant. The more I listened to her the more I realized how much of a “pick me” she was. Her whole aura screamed “please like me”. 

My last straw was when he went on a business trip out of state with all of his coworkers. I couldn’t go because of my job. He was supposed to be gone for 10 days but it was cut early and they were back within 7 days. We had a big fight the night before he left and I slept on the couch. He not only didn’t tell me but he was at her house, and had gotten wasted supposedly on her couch. I found out they were back due to another friend we had in common posting that he got back and was on the trip with them. I was so upset and was calling him not stop because at the time I knew they were back but I had no idea where he was and if he was okay. He was ghosting me. I called her but the line was busy. Tara never called me back, never said that he was safe at her place. I felt disrespected and blocked her on everything. I thought about driving to her house to see if he was there, but I thought to myself “no, he wouldn’t be over there and not come home. He’s gonna come home.”

The next day when he did come home. I was pissed. I asked why and where he was. He said nothing happened. He really thought I didn’t know that he had come home early or that I wouldn’t find out till the next day. I told him how I cried myself to sleep, worried. He told me that Tara was on the phone with her boyfriend and she didn’t call me back because it was late. I was done. I told him that he could go hang out with her, but that I would not be joining them anymore. He never stopped trying to get me to come and acted like I was the problem, but I never looked at her the same. And I didn’t want anything to do with her anymore.

It really was a shame, because in the beginning I really did like her. But as I got to know her, I realized all her jokes, the ONLY thing she joked about was suicide or sex. I’m not easily offended, but it was just too much for me. Well after all this I guess it got to Brandon that we didn’t get along anymore and while he was at work, he was in situation in which it would have been easy for him to end his life. He told me only after we had another fight and he said he seriously considered it but didn’t because he would leave me in a bad situation. I couldn’t believe what I heard. In all the time that I knew him, he has never, ever been depressed or stressed out to this point. The kicker? It wasn’t recent. It had already been a month since that moment and I had no idea. This is not the man I loved. 

The reason I said in the title that he was emotionally cheating is because he never stops talking to her. Consistent texts, calls while we were watching tv together so they could talk about work. They also made lots of sex jokes to each other. She was also a very touchy person but not in a cuddle way, like a hitting kind of way. At a certain point, I felt like I was a chore for him because we’re married. I snapped and asked if he wanted a divorce but he said no and that I’m who he wants but does nothing to prove it. I told him that I was jealous, he didn’t care. He even told me that he doesn’t like my childhood friend, someone I’ve know for 15 years, and that if he has tolerate him, then I should tolerate her. I told him that it’s not the same thing because not only does my friend live in a different state,  I’ve know him for a really long time and his family. It’s not fair. Brandon only met Tara 6 months ago. He told me he was really torn because he loves me but he said that he has never had a friend like her before and that I’m making him choose between his “only” friend or me. 

I have not seen Tara since and Brandon and I barely talk about things. We have not been able to get past this. I do not know if we can really stay married. I suggested couples therapy but we have not gone. Please, I don’t know what to do. 

P.S. I love your podcast! I’ve been listening for a long time while I clean my house. Thank you for all the motivation.

Edit/ update: I guess I forgot to mention a lot. I am not mad at Tara as much as I am mad and frustrated with my husband. We are separated as of right now but I am not in a position, financially to divorce. I am safe. To make everything worse, I was laid off from work. I have 100 dollars to my name. I have no living family left. We never even had a wedding just signed the papers. I do not have money for a PI or money for a lawyer. I am safe. Thank you for those who were empathetic towards me. 

**Also locker room talk means misogyny or objectification of women not jokes about sexiness general.

We were together for 2.5 years. I fucked up bad, I didn't realize it until it was too late and now I regret losing the gem that she is. Finally she decided to call it quits 2 days ago. I only have suicidal thoughts now.

I'm in between job switch and was preparing for interviews but I can't focus anywhere now. I don't know if I'll be alive in a week or not.

Sure there are many complications here which I want to fix and get back with her but time is a constraint, plus she wants me to focus on my career first. And if I actually focus on myself and my career, there is a possibility to fix things. But at the moment, I can't seem to put my mind in anything else. I just cried my heart out.

April 21st this viewer was dropping hundreds of subs, [totaling at 1k subs for xQc alone](https://i.imgur.com/LRXXaWz.png). I reached out to them, they were in terrible shape mentally, [it was incredibly depressing](https://i.imgur.com/hR2Uehh.png).

I tried reaching out to HealthyGamer and managed to speak with a mod about what we can do, which was ultimately, not much.... we can provide support and resources but a line stuck with me, ""...the will to be helped is fundamentally in their hands."" 

I want people to try support others in the community, I understand it can be exciting when people are dropping hundreds of subs and you think you may get one, but just remember the person donating may not always be as well off as they seem.

I was out on a date with a girl and things were going well despite me being a nervous wreck. We got to talking and she admitted she had depression and at one point was even suicidal, but was proud of herself for getting past that chapter of her life. She then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. It’s all very sweet and heartfelt. Now, I in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say “You know in programming it means end”.

She doesn’t say anything.

I don’t say anything.

Tw: rape, suicide 

My husband cheated on me about a year ago. I was heartbroken but we have two children together 3y and 18months. I chose to stay and he promised not to cheat again because he said he regretted it. I couldn’t fully commit to our marriage however and I couldn’t let him touch me. He said he understood and would give me time. About a month ago he wanted me and I thought I was fine but them I started picturing him with her and I couldn’t. He got upset and said that he’s been patient enough and he did it. 

I told him he was r***ing me do you see that? Do you know that? and he just put his hand on my mouth to make me stop saying it and crying. He was like possessed I never seen him that way. Now a month later he has lost maybe 10 kgs and he looks like a zombie. He refuses to eat or even drink water or go to work. He bursts into crying and he said he doesn’t want to live. I don’t know what to do. I have my children to think about and I told him a million times that I forgiven him but he just cries hysterically and says he hates himself and didn’t deserve to live. I don’t know if I can get him committed but if I say why maybe they will press charges. I’m lost.

Hi!

Editing works now. My in laws were here. My husband wasn’t happy I’ve called them. He ended up telling them everything anyway and he agreed to go with them. He will be committed tonight. My mother in law asked if I wanted her to stay with me and the children but I said no. I just want to be with my children now. I have a lot of paperwork to do so my husband doesn’t lose his job and to get him on sick leave for insurance purposes. 

Thank you for your support. I wasn’t sure if I should involve family but I’m glad I did

2)Practice Semen Retention, even during sex.

3)Learn to say NO to sex when you feel anxious. Forcing yourself to have sex when you are anxious will only fuel the vicious cycle.

4)Slowly reduce the amount of manual touch while edging to a point where you only need to touch the penis with two fingers near the base. This will strengthen the bulbospongiosus/ischiocavernosus muscle pair.

5)Do not schedule sex. It puts on pressure to perform and makes anxiety worse. Instead, tell your partner you DONT want to have sex and you just want to cuddle/be intimate. You will find that when the expectation to have sex isn’t there, foreplay can become very relaxing and you will forget about your anxiety. 

6)Only have sex when your BODY wants to. This may seem counterintuitive but listen to your body. Stop beating yourself up. Stop letting your partner dictate when you have sex. You will find that telling your partner no makes her want you even more and the sense of control you will feel will work wonders for eliminating anxiety. 

7) slow it all down. If you have established that you don’t want to have sex and you just want to be intimate, it will all happen naturally and there will be the added sexy element of doing something forbidden. Classic reverse psychology.

8)Cuddle naked with your partner with no plans of having sex. She will “misbehave” and try her best to break the no sex rule. This can be great for establishing control and beating the vicious cycle. 

9) on a first date/first time situation, say NO right when things are about to go from clothed to naked. And say goodnight. Try this and thank me later. 

10) Never ever force it or let your partner give you a blowjob or a hand job in hopes of getting it up. Say No the moment you feel anxious or if it is not pleasurable for you. So much misery can be avoided if you listen to your body.

11) There is a reason condoms make your penis go soft. Thousands of years of evolution are at play. Stop using condoms if you don’t want to. Get tested, find a partner you can trust, have her go on birth control etc there are many ways. Or just roll the dice and have some hot risky sex (not my advice lol) point is take control of your sexuality.",1679293976,psychological

Price swings from 420-136 and you see a house you could buy disappear.

You see those medical bills your family is underneath come back.

You see rent.

You see the price of formula.

The massive price swings are literally horrifying, especially for us.

So try to keep in mind that keeping yourself physically prepared to deal with it is part of winning this war.

All they've got is theatrics and price manipulation but its hard to watch.

So to get ready for the kind of war we're going into tomorrow:

1. Sleep if you can. At least get some rest. Your brain without sleep has poorer responses to stress and makes worse decisions.
2. Eat. Plan an easy breakfast. Remind yourself to eat too, the adrenaline is going to mask your appetite.
3. Monitor your substances. Your adrenaline will work as a stimulant, not need to pound red bull all day. Its just make you jittery and more vulnerable to their only weapon: financial horror and stress.
4. Plan breaks and places to do it where you're away from shit. Take a walk or a drive. Sit on the porch and spark one for 10 minutes while MM's try to scare you.
5. Visualization. Open your brokerage. Look at the GME price while breathing deeply. Now imagine it being $96 dollars. Keep breathing deeply. Now picture it being 6969669.42. Keep breathing deeply.
6. Definitely jerk off.

No matter what happens with the price take care of yourself. Don't let these ghouls get in your heads.

We got this.

&#x200B;

Hey everybody.  This is my first every post on Reddit even though I have been lurking around here since I started playing the game 6 years ago.  However, after hearing about Prestige Aatrox [here](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/prestige-points-and-new-prestige-edition-skins), I decided that I had to say something.  I work for the government as a specialist in influence and behavioral modification, and I immediately recognized the manipulative psychological tactics used in regards to the acquisition of Prestige Aatrox.  I wanted to dissect exactly what Riot did, why it matters, and how they can change their actions to be more respectful and honest towards their player base.  So lets get started.

&#x200B;

First, we need to look at the Prestige skin line as a whole. According to [this post on the League Forums](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/qKY4WrdK-kda-kaisa-prestige-edition), these skin line was originally introduced to the player base as a status symbol for ""players that value rarity/exclusivity"" and are willing to put forward the ""additional investment requirement (centered) around engagement"" while also allowing players to ***""use event loot purchases as a way to supplement their token earn rates"" (remember this last point, it will be important).***  These skins developed a reputation in the community as skins earned by players who were willing to grind out the large number of games required to get these skins.  The Prestige skins were received with a positive outlook at their beginning as some players invested the resources to acquire them, meeting Riots specified objective.  People associated the people who earned these skins with the time investment required to get the skin.

Now comes Blood Moon Aatrox Prestige.  This version of the Prestige skins can no longer be obtained via a time investment.  It can only be acquired through Prestige Points, which have to be bought.  Now, the identity of this skin is shifting from a symbol of dedication, to a symbol of what Riot Mort described in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/aelmac/prestige_points_and_new_prestige_edition_skins/edqivzm/?context=3) as a ""look at Mr. Moneybags over here"" and ""I'm a big spender"" skin.  Riot is using the good will of the player base to boost the appeal of this new skin that represents something different than it originally did.  While I personally think this is manipulative thing to do, I don't think the concept of a ""big spender"" skin is inherently bad.  If there is a market for these type of skins, then Riot should push to fill it.  However, it is *how* Riot has you go about your big spending that is truly manipulative.  To acquire the Prestige Points to get Prestige Aatrox, you need to spend your money in a very specific area of the League Marketplace: The Loot System.

Most people believe that Loot Boxes are a bad characteristic in the gaming industry, but they may not understand exactly what these systems do to you cognitively to encourage spending.  To grossly simplify how these systems work, when you open a loot box, you experience a positive feeling, and when you get a big reward like a skin you really want, your brain releases even more chemicals that make you feel better.  However, by making these big rewards of positive feeling occur at random, that positive feeling is stronger in your mind and you will crave it for longer.  That is why gambling can be so addictive.  The randomness of a huge reward makes you keep striving for the reward for longer, which keeps you engaged with that system.  So, in order to access Prestige Aatrox, you will be exposed to this loot system with a range of 20 loot boxes (by getting the blood moon capsules and a gem stone bundle) to 100 loot boxes (if you buy each one individually).  You aren't just spending $100+ to get one skin, you are getting a huge amount of variable content along with it, which could provide you with a positive interaction with Loot system.  Again, this isn't inherently bad, but when you add it all up, it shows the complex influence operation that Riot has put together.

Riot's target audience for this skin is people who are willing to spend a large amount of money on a single skin.  They say it themselves.  They are taking that audience, and they are pushing them towards the loot system, which we know is designed to encourage more spending using gambling-like techniques.  So, by getting this vulnerable audience to engage in this predatory system, they are actively trying to develop more whales for their games.  And what's sad is the fact that we should have seen this from the beginning.  When they **first** created the Prestige line\*\*,\*\* they tied those skins to the **pass system**, which also gave you **free loot boxes**, and **you could always purchase loot boxes to get tokens**.  The Prestige skins have always been tied to the loot system, trying to drag players into interacting with it.  Riot has been pushing us along this path the entire time, and now they are taking the next step by creating a skin tied exclusively to manipulative systems.

I love League.  I have played this game more than any other game, I have invested an unholy amount money willingly over the years because I love the skins and I wanted to support Riot.  However, if my theory is correct, that Riot is actively trying to put people vulnerable to gambling-like behavior towards a manipulative gambling system, then that is the single worst thing I have ever seen them do over the years.  However, there is a chance that I am wrong, that they aren't trying to herd us like sheep.  If that is the case, Riot needs to change this system.  I can see a few ways they could  do this:

1. Return to a grind based system to reward the players willing to devote the time, maintaining the objective of rarity
2. Have the skin be linked to Champion Mastery to really reward the dedicated mains of these champs and maintaining the objective of rarity
3. Give people Prestige Points simply by buying RP, which maintains this new objective to create a skin for big spenders.  There are plenty of people who are willing to spend hundreds of dollars on this game, just not in the loot system

&#x200B;

I really hope Riot looks at this system.  It is manipulative and it abuses the good will of the player base that has invested so much into this game.  We are the life blood of Riot, but stuff like this makes them seem more like mosquito sucking every last drop of blood we have.  This decision makes me question if Riot really cares about the interests of the community, but I hope they prove me wrong and change this manipulative scheme.",1547305717,psychological

While not as expensive as $15 each season, this psychological pattern is concern.",3886,138vwc6,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/138vwc6/a_breakdown_of_the_psychological_trick_in_bungies/,909,"Edit: Title typo. *Is concerning. _Dammit._

Anyway, hi DTG.

Hot topic, I know. And let's be real, Eververse is ""non-negotiable"", there's very little chance this feedback will change much. But Bungie's clearly put some thought into this. It’s not a flat price increase (in fact it’s barely one at all). 

I've been seeing a whole lot of misinformation from people trying to calculate seasons with $20 purchases, or saying it's $15 ""each season"", and I'm here to lay out the numbers to set the record straight. It's $15 the first season, then assuming you hang onto silver (Bungie's goal), it's $10 for future seasons. 

**Seasons now cost $45 instead of $40 for the year**. And you still can buy another season after that for $10. 

There is *very little ACTUAL price increase*. Shit's basically still gonna be $10 for 4 out of 5 seasons. But there's a helluva lot of more mind games.

---

First, some math. 

If you buy your seasons individually, previously it was $10 of silver per season, flat out. No strings attached. Silver is purchased and then removed. Clean sweep. 

But now, **assuming you had 0 silver**, you must first purchase $15 worth of silver in order to afford a season pass. This comes in the form of one 5$ (500) purchase, and then one 10$ (1000+100) purchase.

Doing this grants you 1600 silver in total. Given that seasons are now 1200 per, that means that you will be left with 400 silver after buying it. Now, could you spend that in the store? Sure. There's items for sale that are 300 silver, so it could be Bungie going ""You already spent the money, so why not give us your silver for more cosmetics"". 

But assuming you hang onto it, or even if you do buy an item for 300, regardless of what happens **you will always have some silver left over**. Which is good, because the next $10 bundle you buy gives you 1100 silver, meaning that any remaining value of 100 silver will make the next season only require a $10 purchase. This essentially makes every purchase you make in the Eververse store a ""pre-order"" of the next season, because you're being given extra silver that makes the next season affordable on the $10 line.

Assuming you only spent silver for the seasons:

----

$15 this season for 500 + 1100. 1600 silver - 1 season = 400 leftover silver.

$10 for 1100 silver next season. 1500 silver - 1 season = 300 silver left over.

$10 for 1100 silver next season. 1400 silver - 1 season = 200 silver left over.

$10 for 1100 silver next season. 1300 silver - 1 season = 100 silver left over.

$10 for 1100 silver next season. 1200 silver - 1 season = 0 silver left over.

---

It's $5 extra in order to get an ""annual pass"" of 4 more seasons at only $10, their previous price. 

On paper, this seems great. You spend $15, and assuming you don't buy anything else from Eververse, you always get to carry over the leftover silver from last season, into the next season, and you're able to purchase it for only $10, up for a full year. It's a miniature pass! 

However, the whole reason someone would be buying the seasons piece by piece is if they weren't sure if they'd be able to play them. So having this left over silver compels you to buy the ""now $10"" season pass, because you always have leftover silver to do so. 

**You never have to spend $15 again for 15 months once you've spent it once**. And people even mentioning the $20 option are just flat out bad math. So it's not $15 ""each season"". But the fact that Bungie has made it so now you always have silver left over? The fact that now, no matter what you buy, how you buy it, there's always some small amount of silver left over? That's going to be the thing that gets on people's nerves fast. 

No matter the value of silver left over, if you have any amount leftover, it will be enough to make the season pass only cost you $10. It's a preorder of the next season, compelling you to hang onto it. They're rewarding those who spend money in Eververse by saying ""Hey, you bought something, you have left over silver, here, have a discount for next season on us.""

They are incentivizing piecemeal players to never go down to 0 silver. Because if they do, they lose their ""ticket"" to $10 seasons. 

It's a clever trick for sure, but I'm just here to give the PSA that this is why Bungie made the system the way it is. Because $10 is less than $12 (the ""true"" cost), and it's definitely less than $15 (the ""actual"" cost), so they incentivize you to hang onto leftover silver for 3 months at a time. 

And for some people, seeing that small amount of silver in their balance will compel them to buy more cosmetics anyway. That's the psychological trick.

**If you, as a player, can self-control to not spend Eververse money, you get to keep seasons at $10**. If you cannot, and you end up buying more and more because you want to ""top off"" the amount you already have, then that's what Bungie was hoping for. 

This is not a seasonal price increase. This is just an ""excess silver"" increase, to lure you into buying more.

If you hang onto the silver and don't spend it, then you're 'rewarded' with next season only costing $10. Every silver purchase you make is just a downpayment on the next season. 

---

**TL;DR:** Seasons still essentially cost $10, but now only:
 
* For as long as you have any amount of silver in your account

or 

* If you bought the deluxe edition

Either buy the deluxe edition, or hang onto silver across seasons to get a ""discount"" on the next. The trick is that Bungie is expecting you to buy cosmetics if you already ""have the silver"" in your account. Some people will be able to resist the temptation, some won't. That's how they earn their money.",1683308574,psychological

My best advice is to set limit orders way in advance and then forget. Put maybe price alerts around earnings if you have dry powder in case of a huge dip. Don't borrow to buy more or overextend yourself. Just put the money you are ok to not need in the medium or long term. This is an investment.

I've been with GME since October last year and seeing how the og of this play versus now is kind of scary to say the least.

I wasn't as early as DFV or Cohen but I got in because I make bet based on people and after literally watching every RC's interview and reading every article I went all in. The group that was into GME back then was much smaller so that's why it caught Wallstreet off guard. The current state is way fking different.

Everything we do is being monitored, we're in the light they're in the dark. It's great that we share knowledge about the market and how crooked these hedges are but remember to always double check, just because someone do a DD doesn't mean they are correct (I don't care who they are). A lot of you who so impatient is because you TRULY did not understand this play and just following blindly. I will list out couple of things that help me and could possibly help you take your mind off of this obsession (it's more healthy for your brain this way, at least imho)

1. Understand the person in charge of this company and ask yourself, if all the info out there of this person is true. Can I trust him with my money, if your answer is yes then leave your money with him and go on with your life.

2. Think of the money you invested in GME is gone, it is no longer your money. If you open a business, the cost of opening a business is gone and you can't take it back so you either follow or fold (take the L if you can't handle it)

3. Any specific subreddit is an echo chamber, everyone love the good old confirmation bias. Because we get bored of shit easily since we're living in a instant gratification, we want excitement every day. Control this and you can 100% �� this to infinity when it squeeze. (So don't look for confirmation bias)

4. Worshipping people, you putting that person in control of your decision. If this is your life saving or the money you care  so much then why? The one who runs GME is Ryan Cohen, not reddit mods. So stop worshipping people.

5. Last one, as much as we all want this play to be our retirement play because you hate your job. Treat this like it isn't, treat it like an investment and not a lottery ticket. Treat it like the squeeze isn't a play but the company's future is so fking bright that it is a no brainer. We know the gaming industry better than these cartridges calling boomers (who the fk use that word anymore). Soon they will cave and be the late investors, be happy you're early. 

The only thing everyone need to do right now is vote if their broker allow them to vote. Live your fking life like nothing going to change. Don't let your impatient fk with your money because it will, especially you're going to invest in the future. People lose money in the market mostly because of either impatient or gambling. I know this isn't a typical DD of the stock, but more of a DD of you as an ��� 

TLDR: live your life like nothing going to change and ���������

I, being a very curious guy asked the psychologist what the difference was between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. This very question left the psychologist very uneasy, she could not give a clear answer and was left uncomfortable for the rest of the presentation. When it finally ended the teacher who was with us was fuming at me since apparently ""that was not appropriate"" and I ""needed to learn when and where to ask questions to not leave people in an awkward situation"".  


Needless to say, I was furious. So a person comes to a bunch of 17-year-olds to deliver a lecture on something and they aren't ready to answer a single question about what they have been talking about five minutes before? Besides, no one else was giving two craps about the presentation, I was the only one who cared enough to ask questions. Had I not interrogated the psychologist she would have had a hard time regardless, as it would be noticeable that no one was caring.  


My class is divided on this, my teachers are against me and my parents are divided too, with my father being on my side and my mother against me.

To put it in its simplest description, a compulsion loop is the feeling of needing to optimize everything, to play as efficiently as possible. It's that drive to grab bounties before doing anything, that feeling that there's all these things you can do to optimize the time you spend in the game. 

It makes your primary approach to gameplay not be one based in the moment to moment gameplay of the activities you're in, but rather one based in making sure you are hitting as many of your personal optimizations as possible. 


How often have we seen people complaining that Vanguard bounties were annoying because other people getting the kills meant that sometimes it took multiple strikes to complete one? 

That's the effect of this design philosophy. Destiny is a game where one of the most common sentiments I've heard from other players is ""I love this game, don't play it"" because it's got all these mental traps in how it's designed.

Champions and Match Game are some of the most obvious implementations of a compulsion loop. In your average game, freedom and experimentation are a massive part of the core gameplay experience. You look around and try different weapons and strategies out in order to find a style you really enjoy. 

Champions and match game didn't allow for any of that for the longest time. Instead of being something you had to strategize around, they became something you needed to optimize for. 

It's why arbalest was meta, it was the easiest solution to the problem. It allowed you freedom to mess around with your energy and heavy slots. Things like adaptive munitions were an experimental solution while bungie was trying to figure out how to get people back to using different loadouts, but ultimately the solution was ripping the band-aid off and opening up champions to subclass verb interaction and getting rid of match game. 


These things are good steps towards breaking free of a lot of this ""i need to be optimal or I'm throwing"" mentality and I think the game is heading in a good direction nowadays. But it's important to be aware of these things in order to make sure your relationship with the game is a healthy one. 

Keep an eye out for these patterns in other games too. It's honestly way more prevalent than you'd think.",1683772187,psychological

**I (30F) think my partner (33M) is psychologically abusive.**


We’ve been together for 4 years and over the span of 2 years I’ve noticed his behaviour change. He was very warm, kind, generous, and generally a lovely person to be around.

However, over the past 2 years I’ve noticed that things have been slowly changing. He’s become quite critical and disrespectful of me. For example, he compares me to my friends and references how they’re in senior and technical jobs, whereas I’m in a more administrative position. He’ll comment about how intelligent they are and how I’m sort of the odd one out. I hear comments from him on a daily basis that are like small jabs at my intellect, looks, attention span, interests, etc. I‘ve told him to stop making these comments but he’s like ‘I’m just joking’ or will forget that I told him to stop. 

When we’re fighting, the remarks are often much more intense and crueler. For example, he’s said the he’s had to change his standards for a partner to accommodate me, that I’m not right for him now but after I continue to work on my faults, that I’ll be perfect for him in like 5-10 years, and how I have to ‘earn’ his love. 

Moreover, when we do fight it's hard to get to a resolution. We end up talking for hours in circles and he ends up bringing in other shortfalls I have that are many times unrelated to the topic we are fighting about. If I defend myself, he’ll often say I’m playing the victim and can’t see the situation clearly. He's also incredibly logical and very good at arguing so I find myself confused and many times utterly lost in the conversation. So I end up contradicting myself or feeling very puzzled and don't know how to respond.

Because I’m so exhausted and confused I end up going quiet and just listen to him. I typically respond with 'yes', 'I agree' or 'you're right' because I am just so tired.  In these moments, he'll be like well 'why don't you speak up' or 'do you really agree with me or are you just saying yes' and I usually just respond in the affirmative because if i disagree, that doesn't help the fight and ends up extending everything because he wants to talk about how I could possibly feel different to him. 

When the fights get really bad, I usually want to just go and take some time away because I feel so overwhelmed. His response to this is usually that I give up, that I’m always taking the easy route in life, don’t have the fight in me and am not resilient.

I just feel like I’m always on the receiving end of criticism which revolves around me having to change. I do have a tendency to forget and be a little spacey, which has gotten worse over time. It's interesting because I'm not this way with others and I wonder if I'm becoming this way because I get lectured so often. I just never thought I was this way before, and now I just feel like I should have a work in progress sign around my neck.

I guess this gets back to me asking whether this is a psychologically abusive situation or if I’m just being too sensitive. Any help is appreciated.

Update: hi everyone. Thank you so much for your comments. Please know that I took everything to heart and have decided to leave my partner. I think I’ve been conditioned to accept a horrible situation and did not realize the gravity of the situation. I’ll provide an update in the next couple of days as to what transpires. Thank you again for the strength and courage to do this. It’s really hard when you still love the person, and feel like there were/are many happy moments in the relationship. I now know that I have to prioritize my sense of self-worth and dignity. If he truly loved me and cared for me he would never make me feel this way.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10jnx6g/update_i_think_my_30f_partner_33m_is/)  (24 Jan 23)


**Update - I think my (30F) partner (33M) is psychologically abusive.**


I didn’t have the heart to end the relationship, so I told him that I wanted space to think about everything. He didn’t take that well at all, he tossed his ring that he wears as a commitment to me and said I was making a big mistake. I apologized and said that I really need the time to figure everything out. As I was leaving he said some unkind things and I went to my brothers house. 

Now this is where it gets a bit odd. I told him as I left that I didn’t want to talk to him for a while and he agreed. But within 2 days of being away he showed up to my brothers place asking for me. My brother was a bit stand off-ish and told him to leave but I allowed him to come inside. We ended up talking for a while and he asked me to come back. The conversation didn’t lead to much, I maintained that I wanted space and he left. Within a few days I found out that he told three of my closest friends that I was mentally unwell, stonewalling him and not being communicative. He shared a ton of information with them about our relationship dynamics and painted me as emotionally immature, impetuous, and unstable. They told me everything and honestly I was shocked. I had assumed he would respect me just asking for space, but it seemed he wanted to go scorched earth to push his version of events on everyone around us. 

I kept the fact that I knew all of this private and didn’t confront him about it. I just wanted to avoid a fight and was just so exhausted of trying to defend myself. I met up with him around 5 days after that and told him that I wanted to officially end things. His initial reaction seemed okay. He fought back, but blamed me quite a bit for the situation we were in. He said that I never shared how I felt, that I was springing this on him out of no where, and that he was committed to making the relationship work while I was giving up and running away from our problems as usual. I told him that I just can’t take it anymore and that I have been disrespected for so long and never felt good enough for him. I held my ground and we parted ways. 

Later in the evening, he called me and told me that we can’t just ends things and wanted to talk to me. I told him not to come by my place, but he was already outside. My brother was livid, but I allowed him inside once again. We talked for a while but this time it was completely different. He acknowledged every wrong thing he ever did to me in the relationship. He said he psychologically abused me and that I never deserved that treatment. He asked for forgiveness and said that he knows he needs to be better and that he doesn’t expect me to take him back. He was so unequivocally apologetic and somehow managed to recall every horrible thing he’s said and done to me (without me sharing anything). It was kind of scary because it made me think that all those times he treated me poorly were on purpose. I asked him if it was and he said that no, he was projecting and was treating me poorly because he was insecure. He maintained that he didn’t realize how much he was hurting me because I didn’t call him out on it and had he known how deeply I was troubled he would have stopped. I just didn’t believe this because I would never treat anyone the way he treated me had I been insecure or upset with the relationship. It just seemed like such BS and a bunch of excuses. He told me that he was going to see a therapist and that he wanted to change. Ultimately, I maintained my position and didn’t take him back.

We’ve been talking here and there since then. I feel confused because I want to accept his apology, but I just don’t trust him anymore. He was so quick to call our entire friend group and tell them I was batshit and then within a couple of days tells me ‘omg im an asshole, I don’t deserve you, etc.’ It just all comes across as very disingenuous and fake. He still maintains that he didn’t know he was hurting me and thought I could ‘take the punches’. 

Anyways that’s pretty much it. I’m sad, confused and just feel even more unloved.

I'm a college student majoring in Psychology. Today we were in a Zoom call because covid numbers in my school area started to spike up. My class is at 8am, so my roommate hasn't left for class yet. 

We are going about our lecture and my roommate wake up and gets on his phone. My Psychology teacher starts talking about Dopamine in the brain. He talks about adrenaline junkies who like to skydive and bungee jump. My teacher says ""I cannot begin to think what goes on in someone's mind to want to jump off a bridge with a rubber band around their waist."" So I turn to my roommate and say ""Some people like to jump without a rubber band.""

Then I heard my class go silent with a few gasps and 1 quick chuckle. Then my teacher said ""Please don't make those kinds of jokes in my class thank you."" I froze and quickly muted myself. 

My roommate died laughing at me. I felt so embarrassed. Roommate is still laughing at me. 

Edit: I thought I was muted. I wasn't

1524,Psychological Trick to Reducing Expenses,2179,9rcrlf,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9rcrlf/psychological_trick_to_reducing_expenses/,404,"We don't talk a whole lot in this sub about expense management, despite the fact that it is a critical component of FIRE.

Some expenses are harder to reduce than others. For me, it was eating out at work. Nearly every day I'd spend about $8.50 for a mediocre burrito, sandwich, or some other culinary money trap.

It took a while to get into a routine of making crock pot meals to remedy this, but when you do some quick math, it becomes real hard to justify my previous habit.

I'm able to get 4 meals out of a crock pot that also costs about a total of $8.50. Previously, 4 lunches would have cost me $34, so this saves me $25.50 each time.

This is amplified if we look at the time cost. Picking up the extra groceries only takes a few minutes a week, and the prepping+dumping of the food into the crock pot doesn't take much time either. It totals about 20 minutes.

So I'm saving $25.50 for 20 minutes of work. That's $76.50/hour, way more than I'm currently paid. 

BUT this is all after-tax savings. If we assume a 30% marginal tax rate, it's more like $109.29/hour.

So basically, every three crock pot meals I do is like making 110 bucks an hour. Not a bad gig.

I know I'm not the first person to think about expenses in these terms but if we can flip the thought process of reducing expenses in terms of pre-tax income, it makes it more fun. It flips the narrative from ""cutting back"" to ""earning more.""

Anyone make any similar expense cuts? I'd be interested to see what sort of value it translated to.",1540491016,psychological

The over prescribing medication topic is also something that often comes up in discussions with others in real life. It really stresses me out and I’m only a first year. Im even starting to see people condemn the entirety of the mental health field. 

However, I have so many interests in psychiatry including eating disorders, addiction, public psychiatry and now reproductive psychiatry which I just found out about. And I love how passionate so many psychiatrists I meet, or psychiatry programs I read about online, are ingrained in social justice efforts. But then I see people like Marianne Williamson say people are killing themselves because of their antidepressant side effects and wonder how much I could possibly do to stop that from happening in my future practice

It was boring. I didn't get it. My back hurt from standing all day. I felt like there wasn't any action. It wasn't till I started rotating with another psychiatrist that I started having fun.

This particular doctor had a reputation as being a bit controversial, and they certainly lived up to the rumor. They had no regard for 'the rules'. Everything could be questioned. An interview didn't have to feel so rigid and feel like a review of systems. We could use something called 'counter-transference' - an awareness of how the patient made YOU feel. Yeah, that patient was annoying, lets admit it. That might indicate we're dealing will illness anxiety disorder. Wow. Yeah, its true those borderlines give you a certain frequency that you can pick up on. It feels like confusion, really. You are the diagnostic tool. How cool is that?  I don't need to take a stethoscope and pretend like I am ruling out heart murmurs. I AM THE TOOL.

My first real interview was a blast. I was talking with a supposed schizophrenic. They were telling me all about rocks and witches and how they're cursed and hearing voices, which was all very entertaining to hear. Then I asked something I had heard my attending say as a joke: ""so in which ear are you hearing those voices?"". A look of panic shoots through the patient's eyes. ""Ummmm....  the left, no I mean the right!"". Got 'em. It felt like everyday I came home with an amusing story.

Then, I started to think about the field of psych in general, and what I saw were a ton of pluses.

1. A huge need that is growing - massive waiting lists
2. A new generation which thinks mental health is important
3. amazing residency - the residents were chilling so damn hard. One day I turn to see what my resident is doing and he's watching suits on Netflix.  love it. Came to work at 8 and finished by 3-4 every day.
4. moonlighting as a resident - they actually have time to do it
5. rising income - residents giving me the scoop on prospective salaries in the high 300s
6. Telehealth - live anywhere and do psych from home. There are some laws about accepting medicare/medicaid and prescribing meds if you're overseas which does sort of put a dent in my dream of living in an Italian villa, but I'm sure I'll find a work-around.
7. tons of research opportunity - development of new and better drugs (incredibly low hanging fruit), running clinical trials, pathophysiology behind literally any mental illness, TMS, electroconvulsive therapy, psychedelics ,etc
8. start-up potential - pharmaceutical company, apps, TMS-like tech, be creative
9. creativity - especially with cbt, cdt, other psychotherapies - it feels like a procedure but I don't need any tools. Its literally an energy transfer between minds how fkn cool. Super excited to think about the future of psychedelic therapy... gonna have some legendary stories

To me, psych is like a plot of land with a bit of foundation for a house. Other houses in the neighborhood are super nice, well-developed, and have alot of prospective buyers. For the psych house, not so much. The owners of the other houses shit on this plot of land because it's ugly.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult about 4 years ago. Since then, I’ve been on a few different forms of methylphenidate and have landed on Concerta. It’s been helpful to me.

I saw a different prescriber today than usual because mine had an emergency and is off for a while. I never met this prescriber before. For context, he’s a PA (and so is my normal prescriber) and not a psychiatrist, just working under one.

It was a strange appointment for multiple reasons, but I’ll only discuss the medication related stuff. He highly encouraged me to not take the Concerta long term because of adverse effects (heart problems and some other stuff I don’t remember). In response to this, I said “well, I will have ADHD forever.”

He also encouraged skipping taking the medication on days I’m not working. I’ve been told not to do this by other providers, and from what I understand from the research, it’s not recommended to skip days. I told him I still have to drive on days I don’t work. (I’m already a space case in the car, we don’t need to make it worse, lol). 

He basically argued that I “wasn’t born with a Concerta deficiency” so I don’t need it basically (or something like that). By this point, I was done arguing and was just like “okay.” But this argument sounds totally weird to me because my urologist wouldn’t tell me I wasn’t born with a myrbetriq deficiency so I don’t need that (plus my implant) to manage my overactive bladder, so….

He seemed to be big into supplements, diet, and exercise. I take some supplements but I don’t like the idea that they’re some replacement for medication, and sure, diet and exercise help, but they don’t manage all the symptoms.

I was wondering what other people’s thoughts were. And if you’re knowledgeable in the research on this stuff, I’d be interested to hear. From the research I’ve done, it seems like long-term stimulant use is actually beneficial, but I’m not well-versed in that and that’s the first time anyone’s said anything about it to me. He also talked about building up a tolerance, which might be a thing, but I don’t know much about that either. Any thoughts/research/similar experiences would be welcome.

Ce matin j'appelle le psychologue du CMPP du secteur pour échanger avec lui sur l'état alarmant d'une enfant de 12 ans, en plein dépression. Etant donné qu'il suit l'enfant régulièrement, je voulais lui demander si une consultation pédopsychiatrique était prévue. Il m'explique bien embêté au téléphone que le pédopsychiatre qui intervenait sur le centre a presque 70 ans, qu'il n'est plus qu'à temps partiel et qu'il va prendre sa retraite cet été. Il n'y a plus que 5 pédopsychiatres sur le département (en le comptant lui, bien sûr). 

Donc si ma jeune patiente a besoin d'un traitement médicamenteux je fais comment ? ben j'en sais rien parce que j'ai aucune formation là dessus et je risquerais de faire vraiment mal les choses si j'essayais de bricoler... 

Ensuite, cet après-midi j'ai au téléphone l'infirmière coordinatrice d'un CH psychiatrique pas très loin, que j'avais sollicité pour un patient qui présente une dépression avec des troubles anxieux et des addictions, très anciens et sévères, et qui serait d'accord pour une hospit sans urgence (il n'y a pas de critère urgent, il est comme ça depuis que je le connais). Elle m'explique que du fait de la réduction du nombre de lit ils ne prennent que les demandes urgentes et donc ne pourront pas l'hospitaliser, à part si sa situation s'aggrave. 
Donc on attend quoi, qu'il se suicide ?

J'ai fondu en larmes quand elle m'a dit ça. Pas que j'ai un lien particulier avec ce patient mais c'est juste que... C'est usant d'entendre ça. Que les patients n'ont pas de solution, que tout va devoir reposer encore sur les épaules du médecin traitant qui n'a pas forcément les compétences pour gérer ça. 

Sur Reddit on voit énormément de personnes en grande détresse qui viennent chercher de l'aide et de l'écoute. On fait ce qu'on peut mais on devrait pas avoir à faire ça. 

Y a des problèmes dans plein de secteurs sur le plan médical mais la psychiatrie c'est vraiment le pire.

Edit : merci à ceux qui s'inquiètent de ma santé mentale. Vous inquiétez pas : ça va. Ces deux coups de fils combinés à la fatigue de la semaine + une consultation un peu difficile ce matin ça m'a mis un p'tit coup au moral mais je vais bien me changer les idées ce week-end.",1686318645,psychiatry

I have a number of med management patients that follow different therapists in our clinic. A recently graduated LCSW wanted to discuss some of our mutual patients. She’s convinced that one of our patients that I suspect has borderline personality disorder actually has bipolar disorder, only because the patient said she was diagnosed with it in the past. This patient has had multiple issues with mood lability, impulsivity, and chronic difficulty with relationships. The patient also previously had a cocaine use disorder and was prescribed lamictal at the time she was diagnosed, which is the main reasoning behind this SW’s diagnosis. She also said the patient looked “manic” the last time she saw her, only on the basis that she was not sleeping a lot and seemed in a better mood. I explained that there are more diagnostic criteria involved in a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and that her cocaine use disorder years ago could’ve led to an incorrect diagnosis. She then told me “well you only see this patient for 30 minutes at a time each month while I see her for an hour each week.” She also was telling me that I should prescribe her a mood stabilizer. I continuously tried to explain to her that what she’s presenting with doesn’t automatically constitute a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and that I will not be prescribing a mood stabilizer if I don’t have a specific diagnosis that warrants it. Unsurprisingly she continued to disagree with me.

Plus in theory I get a few hours more to study in the morning (although I've been using that to get some more shadowing hours in with my research supervisor), so it makes sense to stay late?

She keeps asking if I want to leave, though, and I don't know if she's actually serious, or if this is a test, and if I take the opportunity I'm going to end up with solid ""3""s on my eval and a ""not interested"" comment. I'm gunning for paediatric neurodermatology, which is super competitive, and I can't end up with anything less than honours. But, on the flip side, I don't want her to think I'm sucking up or anything, because *that* might end up on my eval, and it would be just as bad.

What's a student to do? Any advice? Should I ask her for some research opportunities as well, and then that can justify leaving early? How would psychiatry research look on a CV for paediatric neurodermatology?

Edit: Wow, everyone, thanks for all the help!

I find psychiatric conditions extremely engaging and am super interested in how it's integrated with non medical fields such as the criminal justice system. I can go on and on about why I love it BUT the main reason I'm rethinking it is that people are always ""defecating"" on it. The 2 main arguments that get to me are: 

1- you're smart ... don't choose a specialty like that just to get out of doing real medicine work ... don't run away from the challenge.

2- It's barely even medicine ... why not do neurology if you love the brain so much?

This has led me to seriously consider neurology. However, if I make that decision, it'll be 100% driven by my ego.

I don't know what to do. Would doing psychiatry then doing a neuropsych fellowship satisfy my ego in the future? I AM genuinely interested in neuropsych and was thinking about it way before this all started, but now it feels like a requirement just to exit this echo chamber of negativity. what do you guys think?

1617,Insights from a 2nd year psychiatry resident,0,178r41j,Antipsychiatry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/178r41j/insights_from_a_2nd_year_psychiatry_resident/,140,"2nd year psychiatry resident here. I bumped into this subreddit and was reading a few of the threads. I see that most posts here are about medication. So I would like to dispell the notion that all we do is prescribe medication.

Due to the ward's I've rotated, I have a deeper experience in 2 different topics. Depression and addictions. I'll talk about the admission of patients with depression in the hospital I work at.

Patient with a severe depressive disorder gets admitted to a ward. We do and offer the following. This example is for non suicidal patients! For acute suicidal patients please read the next part. 

*Routine labs/MRIs and other medical procedures to determine if physiological factors are involved in the depressive disorder
*After evaluating the case, we offer antidepressant therapy, or modify the current therapy. Obviously with the patient's concent.
*Occupational therapy. Patients learn how to utilize transferable skills.
*Psychotherapy (usually cognitive behavioral, or trauma oriented in specific cases)
*Group learning sessions (what is depression, theories behind it, etc)
*Acupuncture, Meditation and Muscle relaxation techniques
*Sport therapy (from jogging to martial arts)
*Social workers easily available

During their stay, patients are allowed to leave the hospital in the afternoon/evenings to do whatever they want (family, friends etc). They are also eventually allowed to sleep at home, usually a few weeks before discharge. This is only possible after we assess that the patient is not a danger to themselves or others!

In the depression ward, patients are usually admitted 1-3 months, and we work together to try and re-integrate them into society. By the time they are discharged, they:

1) using psychotherapy, gained the insight and tools to understand social factors that might be contributing to their depressive disorder.
2) Learned about the neurobiology of depressive disorders and how medication works.
3) Have tried and found an antidepressant therapy that works for them (if needed).
5) Social workers can help people find a home (if homeless), find a new job (and get paid to learn new skills for it), find a rehab center, get financial aid if needed.

If the patient is acutely suicidal we:
1) Admit or transfer  the patient to a closed/acute ward (this is usually voluntary!)
2) Restrict their ability to either leave the ward, or leave the clinic (according to the case)
3) Offer appropriate medication, that they can refuse (usually Benzodiazepines for a short intervention)
4) And most importantly, they get access to all of the services and procedures mentioned above (by non suicidal patients).

Believe it or not, patients in acute wards have a lot of freedom. They can sometimes even leave the clinic in the evenings to do errands, spend time with family or friends etc and come back at night. Patients aren't stripped off all of their belongings. They use their regular clothes, have their phones laptops etc, can bring personal items. They have regular visits. We even have cutlery in our closed wards! (Knives etc). We have approximately 300 beds, and considering all of this, we only see aprox 1 suicide every year or two within our hospital. This is extremely low, considering the population of patients that we treat.

Physically restraining a patient or giving a patient medication against their will is extremely rare!! You need a judge to evaluate the case and allow the procedure. I can answer more questions about this if needed.

We offer ECT as a treatment option for more severe cases. This is done, again, with the patient's consent. And it's not an in-humane procedure as most of media portrays it to be. Perhaps it was in the past, but we've moved a long way from that. I can gladly try and  answer any questions about ECT If needed.

Our work as psychiatrists is to organize and orchestrate all of this multidisciplinary treatment. And obviously the medical side too (labs, EKGs, MRIs, etc) and medication. 

Just my 2 Cents! I honestly love my job. Although we can never completely ""heal"" a person from psychiatric disorders, we can help increase a person's quality of life and bring them back to a state where they can reintegrate back into society and live again.",1697409464,psychiatry

I went the rest of my life without any medication for ADHD, to say I struggled would be an understatement. I'm a high school drop out, barely got my GED, and 3 time college drop out. 

I finally made an appointment with a Psychiatrist to address my ADHD and I did a little questionnaire and she basically told me that I'm severely depressed and I was like ""Yes because of my ADHD"". She then said no, there's no correlation between ADHD and depression. She said that would be like her blaming high blood pressure for a UTI. 

It completely shocked me. I tried to explain that I was so severely depressed because I can't focus, and that I procrastinate everything, and I can't start or finish anything and she basically went on to say it was my depression mimicking ADHD and that she's not sure if I really have it. 

I just feel defeated at this point. I constantly feel that I'm at ground zero and anytime I try to help myself or move forward I just get nowhere.

I feel a bit uncomfortable to talk about this and I understand a lot may just be my lack of knowledge. Psychiatry does appeal to me and it’s always shown as a good specialty on here. But I have some reservations

Psychiatry feels like it’s been left behind in the 1990s where most other fields of medicine have progressed.

I like that there’s such an emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship, human factors. But it feels like that’s because there just aren’t effective treatments. 

Cipriani 2018 found that antidepressants only work for those with severe depression. It was shown as resounding proof that they work. But digging deeper, they improved mood scores by 2 on the Hamilton scale which is out of 50. Clinically not relevant, and that’s before the side effects get discussed. 

DSM is a collection of accepted ideas that are heavily influenced by big pharma. It feels like making arbitrary boxes out of a cloud that is mental health. That’s not how medicine should work.

Add in that two consultations often disagree on diagnoses in the absence of a single empirical test for any disease. This wouldn’t be tolerated in any other specialty at this scale. 

Finally, so many of the patients are just victims of terrible life events. I don’t doubt this is terrible for them. But I don’t understand how starting them on damaging antipsychotics is preferable. I’ve seen EUPD on dual antipsychotics, SSRIs and benzo. Who would behave normally on that combination?

Sorry if this is a rant. But it feels jarringly different to physical medicine",1664283451,psychiatry

(3) even traditional antidepressants like TCA and SSRI work against about 50% of cases

(2) there are many mental illnesses like schizophrenia that have well-proven medicines for treatment. (3) if you reject psychiatry, you lose not only the ""real"" medicine effect and the placebo effect. Placebo effect is also part of how treatments work.

During this time, I’ve worked for and alongside many psychiatrists.

I will also state I am not writing this to dismiss the very real suffering of those with mental disorders. Rather, I am stating much of their suffering can be increased by the psychiatric field.

Many people confuse psychologists and psychiatrists. Psychologists have a PhD and can practice psychotherapy along with research in academic settings. Psychiatrists attend medical school and specialize in psychiatry and can practice psychotherapy and prescribe medication.

Now for the unpopular opinion - it’s all a dangerous scam.

Mental health work is sensationalized and romanticized in today’s media and entertainment. Therapists are idolized as wise gurus. This includes psychiatry. Why do I say it is a dangerous scam?

Well, let’s discuss mental illness first. Mental illnesses are included in the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is currently on its fifth edition, a giant book filled with - you guessed it - mental disorders and the criterion used to diagnose the disorder. And by the way, there is no blood test, biopsy, urine sample, or any physical data used in diagnosing a mental disorder - it is all observational. A patient must meet a certain number of symptoms described in the DSM to be diagnosed. 

Let’s look at a popular diagnosis as an example - ADHD.

It is listed under neurodevelopment disorders. Here is a summary of the diagnostic criterion.

A. Inattention
1. Makes careless mistakes with schoolwork.

2. Has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks.

3. Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.

4. Does not follow through on instructions.

5. Has difficulty organizing tasks.

6. Often avoids tasks that require sustained mental effort. 

7. Often loses things necessary for tasks.

8. Easily distracted by external stimuli.

9. Forgetful in daily activities.

B. Hyperactivity
1. Fidgets

2. Leaves seat when remaining in seat is expected

3. Runs about in situations when it is inappropriate.

4. Unable to play quietly

5. On the go, as if driven by a motor

6. Talks excessively

7. Blurts out answers

8. Difficulty waiting their turn

9. Interrupts

So, how is it diagnosed? Someone must meet six criterion for each list. Five if they’re an adult. That’s it.

The average length of a psychiatry appointment is 40 minutes. Within that time, the psychiatrist, a total stranger, decides your fate based on what they’ve observed, and then diagnoses you and prescribes a medication based on the diagnosis.

So why is this bogus?

Psychiatry operates on the medical model, which views the mind through a purely physical lens. This means your ailment is treated as a physical problem. The issue with this is that it has never been scientifically proven that mental disorders are caused by the theoretical ‘chemical imbalance’ that is talked about so frequently. So now, with ADHD, we are giving massive amounts of children amphetamines as a medical solution. Does nobody see the insanity in this?

Let’s look at another common diagnosis - major depression. It is hypothesized that depression is due to low serotonin. The medical answer? Prescribe a pill that increases serotonin. Now you have anti-depressants.

The problem is, depression isn’t that simple, nor has it been proven to be caused by low serotonin. If anything, low serotonin might be the result of depression, so you may only be treating symptoms and covering up the true cause of suffering.

Imagine a person walks barefoot onto a asphalt road on a hot day. They start screaming about the pain in their feet. A doctor comes along and says, you have burning foot disorder and we must treat it with opiates. Wouldn’t it make more sense just to guide the person off the road?",1664019521,psychiatry

I'm an anarchist (mutualist, ancom simp) who has a few health and MH issues. My father has severe bipolar disorder and needs to be medicated to be stable. Without medication he is extremely dangerous to himself and others, to the point where he tried to kill me twice as a baby. With his medication, he's ok. He's not well enough to work, but he gets around, goes to watch football, darts, does his painting, his train tips, all sorts of things. He gets about more than I do! The difference is night and day, he's so much happier.

Even posting on here, I’ve had people make assumptions about me based on my chosen profession (which I’ve not been in very long and do not myself have much of any power in as a resident physician). Yesterday, I was looking through therapists’ websites trying to find one that seemed like a possible good fit. I first read one psychologist’s bio on my insurance website, thought he sounded like a potential good match, then went to his website and found an entire page dedicated to why psychiatrists are terrible and he doesn’t advise going to see one. I’m feeling scared that if I go see someone they will have preconceived notions about me because I’m training to be a psychiatrist.

I was in a really bad place before they put me on meds. I legit was going crazy. I hated every second of being on antipsychotics because it felt like It wasn’t me anymore. I also had restless leg syndrome where I would pace around the house for hours and hours. I do believe that the meds I was on stabilized me. It definitely had its negative impacts to though. I gained a good amount of weight and felt super tired for years. A few months ago I decided it was time for me to stop taking my meds all together. I slowly followed the doctors orders to ween off each medication 1 by 1. First he weened me off Vrylar which took about 2 weeks. Next I weened off of clomipramine which took about 2 weeks as well. So now I was only on Lamictal which is a mood stabilizer. But after about 4 weeks being off of clomipramine the anxiety hit me like a freight train. My anxiety gets so bad my body tensed up, my abs and back get rock hard. My thoughts go racing and all my fears just spin in my head. I have been taking Valium to stay calm and unfortunately I have to go back on the clomipramine. There were some factors that might of made my anxiety worse though. I have been smoking too much Mary Jane and smoking nicotine like crazy. I was also trying to quit nicotine with the patches while stopping my meds. The anxiety with the nicotine patches on made it worse so I had to stop the nic patches. Basically what I’m trying to say is you can be both pro and anti psychiatry and that is ok. I will try to ween off the meds again in the future but I need to start taking care of my body first before I do that. I used to play college sports and used to be really happy and healthy. But then I got into the party scene and experimented and abused drugs. I messed my own head up. It’s hard for me to accept that but it is my reality. If it weren’t for the meds that I found to help me I’d probably be dead by now. So I am grateful that they helped me. I have been just anti psychiatry for a while now but after seeing it first hand really help my anxiety I am somewhat pro medicine. Do I think it’s possible for me to get physically and mentally healthy through natural alternatives-idk yet, But I am gonna try in the future. I need to stop all of my bad habits if I want to see any progress. That means I need to work out and maybe play sports again, eat super healthy, take vitamins, practice meditation and love myself.

Been meaning to post on here for a while. I’m a rising 4th year student and having a hard time committing to psychiatry. I enjoyed my psych rotation and could definitely see myself doing it, but Ive also enjoyed many other specialties and could see myself doing other things. My biggest concern about this field is the compensation. I am a nontraditional student and will graduate with more than 260k debt. I have honored the majority of my rotations and have a high STEP score which, statistically speaking, makes the more “competitive” and higher earning specialties achievable for me. 

I live in a HCOL area and don’t plan on leaving here. I am quite disheartened after seeing the salaries posted for psychiatry on various job forums ranging between 200-300k. Meanwhile I see salaries for Psych NP’s which isn’t far from psychiatrists. 

How feasible is it for a psychiatrist to make between 350-400k in the current job market without having to work multiple jobs? I don’t see myself feeling fulfilled spending 15 minutes with patients for medication management to maximize the number of people I can see. In an ideal job, I would like to spend 45 mins to an hour with a patient doing a combination of psychotherapy and medication management. Would this entail taking a pay cut? 

I apologize in advance if these questions are shallow. I want to make an informed decision about my career. My interactions are limited to psych residents who have limited knowledge on the realities of the current job market and I would appreciate input from folks who have more information.

One major issue I have with psychiatry is not necessarily the field itself or psychiatric medications but rather how it's practiced by some psychiatrists. For instance, my brother, at the age of 22, sought help for his depression. The psychiatrist prescribed SSRIs and scheduled a follow-up for a month later. This raises a concern because, according to what we've studied in uni, antidepressants should generally not be given to individuals under 25, and closer monitoring should occur during the first month due to the risk of developing suicidal ideation. Additionally, the psychiatrist didn't provide detailed guidance on how to use the medication, such as starting with a lower dose in the first week.
Furthermore, a common problem I observe with some psychiatrists is their readiness to prescribe medication without exploring other options. It's crucial to first inquire if the patient has tried psychotherapy, and if not, they should be encouraged to give it a chance before resorting to medication. If psychotherapy proves ineffective, the next step should involve considering alternatives like supplements, such as St. John's Wort, before turning to antidepressant pills.",1697946393,psychiatry

I need my antipsychotics and my SSRIs to function, or my OCD would absolutely destroy my life again. To give you an idea of how severe my OCD was before I got medication, here's this list of things I forced myself to do due to my contamination phobia:

I couldn't even leave my bed because I was convinced everything else around me was contaminated.

I couldn't shower without rubbing my arm, legs, and shoulder blades in soap before I could shower.

I'd brush my teeth up to four or more times in a row to feel clean.

I avoided breathing on objects because I figured my breath was contaminated.

I washed not just my hands until they bled ( and even then I still kept going ) but I also washed my forearms, too. Some of the skin was missing on my arms because of this, and you could see that my amount of washing peeled off my first layer of skin in some areas.

I had to change my clothes everytime I exited a room. This caused me to go through laundry and have to do it every few days. I also had to regularly wash my bedsheets, pillow, and blanket.

I could spend hours in a row obsessively ruminating about how and when to perform an OCD ritual and how I should do it. I would also argue with myself for hours about whether or not an object was contaminated.

I'm so glad I'm okay now because OCD ruined my life for a year straight. If I chose to try to pray away my OCD instead of taking SSRIs, going on antipsychotics, and going to therapy it's safe to say that I would still be at the point I was at not too long ago.

I hear a lot of religious people say that people should focus more on changing behavior rather than going on medication, but some us have mental disorders so unmanageable that even with just therapy we'd still be struggling.

There is a risk factor to mental illness called synchronicity. These are coincidences that carry emotional interpretations and are triggering to psychosis, from personal experience, and I’ve asked many patients I have encountered in the psych hospital.

There are naturally occurring coincidences in nature that “normal” people do not notice, but these patterns are real and they do exist. We are not making them up.

For example the word doctor, it spells Do CT OR, as in you need CT imaging prior to surgery in the OR, it is what most doctors (physician) do. this is an example of coincidences that naturally exist, and when I first told psychiatrists this, they sternly asked me who taught me to think like that.

Psychiatrists do not know the existence of synchronicities, an environmental risk factor for psychosis that is not managed at all in the clinical setting, when many patients have brought stories of seeing signs and experiencing synchronicities to their doctors to no avail.

I'm a new psychiatry attending with an outspoken anti-psychiatry student on my team. I imagine either he or someone he knows hasn't had the best experience with it, but I don't know the precise reason.

He is a professional and empathetic person who takes great histories, but refuses to participate in the medical management side of things and is uninterested in psychopharmacology based on his criticisms of the biological model of mental illness despite conversations my residents have had with him about acknowledging these flaws but still having a responsibility to our patients to practice evidence-based-medicine (even if we aren't sure of the exact MoA).

I've heard these criticisms before just not from a medical student. He's also a little uncomfortably anti-psych to my residents when they're teaching but by all accounts a lovely guy otherwise. Does well with the social work side of things too.

I'm not sure what to do with him. My residents have been sending him home early because it's clear he doesn't want to be there. I would consider failing him if he was a garbage history taker, antagonistic to my residents, and all around unprofessional, but he's not that. He's an otherwise amicable person who simply happens to be vocally opposed to the medical management side of psychiatry.

If he'd warm up to that, I'd actually vouch for him being a good psychiatrist in the future just based on his ability to do everything else. Unfortunately, ""everything else"" is not part of the scope of his psychiatry rotation as a medical student, the medical management side of things is, and he refuses to engage with that. By the technicality of it I would consider him to be a failing student in terms of what he's actually placed here to learn, which is medicine.

My instinct is to keep allowing my residents to send him home or simply instruct him to stop showing up to the rotation if he is so strongly opposed to it and then give him a very generic passing grade - he is not at all interested in becoming a psychiatrist so I doubt I have to worry about his education being inadequate in that regard. At the same time, it's important for him to have at least a passing knowledge of psychiatry as those on psychiatric medications also present frequently to other specialties - and I feel like it's a little strange if attendings allow medical students to no-show entire rotations just because they're not interested. If that were the case I wouldn't have shown up to anything besides psychiatry. I can't really tell whether I should fail him or not or if there's anything else I should be doing.

I'd love some advice on this - I've tried to talk to him about this and while he hasn't been unprofessional, I don't think it's gone anywhere and my impression is that as a psychiatrist speaking to someone who is anti-psychiatry, he isn't very fond of me.",1665918798,psychiatry

1685,Taconic Psychiatry Statement to the Community,189,13f8ikf,TherapeuticKetamine,https://www.reddit.com/r/TherapeuticKetamine/comments/13f8ikf/taconic_psychiatry_statement_to_the_community/,50,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to reflect and gather my thoughts before posting.

Two days ago, this community was shaken.  So many of you lost a deeply meaningful relationship, not only to your clinic and treating provider, but also to a treatment that finally has given you hope after so many failed attempts at trying to get better.

Over the last 48 hours, many of you have emailed me and shared your journeys, success, and at this moment, sadness and loss.  I'm grateful that so many people have allowed me to bear witness to their stories and entrust either me or colleagues in my practice with their care.  Those who know me know that I am absolutely passionate about and love this work.  It brings me so much joy to wake up every morning knowing that I have the privilege of doing this work.

I really want to help everyone.  I truly do.  I know that so many of you were instantly displaced from a therapy that works for you.  I've read so many public posts and hear how much so many of you have been helped by a treatment that has included at home ketamine administration.  To those who have emailed, I've read them all and feel honored that you entrusted me to hear some of your most personal stories.

I have spaced my personal appointment times far into the future so I can best assess how to care for my current patients, as well as attend to those who are waiting for evaluations.  I have made promises in this forum about the integrity of my practice and I intend to honor them.

In order to minimize the disruption in patient care for as many as possible, my colleagues and I have all agreed to add additional available appointment times. Just to remind people [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TherapeuticKetamine/comments/1391zcr/taconic_psychiatry_welcomes_scott_akridge_md_and/) lists information about my practice.  My colleagues were vetted and selected by me.  Laura Graham, PMHNP; Conor Glover, PA-C; and Scott Akridge, MD are all accepting new patients.  Laura has an office in Alabama and is only licensed there.  For people who are able to travel to her office, she will have near immediate availability.  Both she and Conor are both directly supervised by me.  

Taconic Psychiatry will continue to be the same practice that you've known.  We pride ourselves on

* Personal relationships with psychiatrists, psychiatrist nurse practitioners and physicians' associates.  Unlike other services, we put our names and credentials front and center and let you know whom you are seeing.
* Full psychiatric care that *includes* treatment with ketamine instead of exclusive treatment with ketamine.  This includes management with other psychotropic medications, mind body connections, herbs and supplements, as well as continued treatment if ketamine treatment is not an option or isn't indicated.
* Qualitative and quantitative data to drive customized unique treatments.  There is no cookie cutter approach for you, the individual. That is why we are so personally responsive to medication/treatment questions. We realize that the use of a medication like ketamine is an important, life altering decision.  It is a big deal and we treat it with the respect and deference it deserves.  

Now, more than ever, I think it is important to maintain the standards that I have set for me, my practice and my patients.  I will continue to maintain one hour intake appointments and 30 minute follow-ups.  I feel confident in the care I provide in that amount of time to give people ample opportunity for me and them to address all of their concerns with professional rigor and unwavering compliance with agencies and regulators . Unfortunately, I also know that we can't be there for everyone who may need care at this time. As difficult as we know this is for you, please know we are doing our best by you by ensuring integrity of care by not overstretching our team and resources.  This community has started to compile [a list of Ketamine Providers by state](https://www.reddit.com/r/TherapeuticKetamine/comments/13ds1e1/ketamine_providers_by_state/).  While I don't endorse this list, it speaks to the amazing sense of community I have witnessed in this forum. 

I know this is a challenging time for so many in this community. It's been humbling to see how you've all come together and provided support and resources to one another.  I'm grateful to be a member of this community and willing to offer whatever resources I can to you as well.",1683859912,psychiatry

There's one waiting in the ED so I'll see them after weekend rounds. Besides dude has SI and EtOH is not back yet so 

0820: I'm pre rounding. Get hammer paged by ED about yhe dude in the ED (his EtOH is back now and is negative) and another dude that has shown up. Other dudes etoh is not back. Explain that I have to round first and will see them after rounds. ED was mostly understanding 

0857: I prepare to round with weekend attending but get called to a behavioral emergency. An old delirious dude is trying to hit a nurse with his walker because he thought she set his house on fire. He gets Haldol 2 and it was miraculously enough. I drop reccs for non-pharmacologic delirium prevention and go back to round with attending

1004: I finish rounding. I'm lucky because I already know the patient from being on that service and half of them think I'm trying to poison them/kill them/imprison them and the other half just wants to masturbate. I politely leave them all alone and uptitrate the clozapine/sgas/mood stabilizers. 

1008: gets paged by the ED again while finishing up the behavioral emergency note and pre charting the ED folks. There's a third dude in the ED. All his labs are back. I add him to the pre chart list. 

1016: unit calls. A female patient pulled a nurses hair because she manic af. They had to give her emergency IM. I fill out the paperwork and go see her. The nurse and patient were both fine. The patient thinks I stole her imaginary boyfriend. I walk away. Another manic patients stops me and tells me that I have saved his life and that I'm the sole reason he trusts the system again. I tell him I'm really glad he feels that way and that im glad that he feels comfortable in the hospital. I check his Lithium level when i get back to my desk. It is subtherapeutic. I uptitrate per day team instruction. 

1030: I go see the 3 patients in the ED. One is here for housing, one is depressed with SI, and one has schizoaffective depressed type and off meds x3mo. I staff the housing guy for discharge. Depressed guy gets transferred because we don't have male beds or sitters. SAD lady gets admitted. During this time, I also get paged by the adult unit and peds unit. I respond to them in between ed patients. Nurse wants me to change the orders for an adult patient. It is non urgent and I told them I'll change it when I get back. Peds unit paged about a very agitated teenager. I could hear her yelling in the background. I put in the emergency meds as a linked PO or IM in case she won't take PO. I grab lunch from the cafeteria on my way back from the ED.

1330 ish: I get back to the resident room start admission process and start the paperwork for the transfer guy over some chicken tenders. I of course remember to change the orders that I got paged about earlier. 

1340: I get paged about a new consult. It was for a heart failure patient with chronic anxiety. Patient will be here for diuresis for a while. No SI/HI/mania. I tell them that I will try to see them today if I can, but they are probably okay to continue home SSRI. If I don't get to it, consults will see them on Monday. (If anything changes regarding emergency symptoms please page us back and we will see them). They were pretty understanding and just wanted the patient on our list. 

1440: I finish the paperwork for the transfer folks and send them to the transfer SW. I start on the notes for today. 

1450: paged by peds. Another kid is yelling. I put in PRN meds. 

1452: the kid that is yelling set off another kid. I put in more PRNs

1455: a third kid is getting aggressive. He gets oral prn 

1502: the kids are fine but an adult is trying to elope and physically threatening nurses because of it. He got an IM half an hour ago. I do the paperwork and go see him. The 5&2 knocked him out. I go back to my notes

1830: all my notes are done miraculously. Nothing has shown up in the ED. I grab dinner

1850: gets paged about new patient in the ED coming in for HI. Dude is getting B52'd. I abandon my salad (so sad) so I can see him before he is fully zonked. 

1920: I get back to my soggy salad. The dude has schizophrenia and is getting hospitalized. We don't have beds. I inform the sw and start the paperwork.

I’m really struggling with thoughts of futility and hopelessness when trying to treat and manage the EUPD patients on my ward. 

It is well established that inpatient admissions for EUPD patients can be counter productive. 

I feel like inpatient admissions are just about managing risk. A patient will get sectioned because they are deemed to be at high risk of suicide, self harm or harm to others and lack the insight to work with community teams to mitigate this risk. We subjectively decide after a period of time that their risk is now lower and send them back out. 

We have many patients with a diagnosis of EUPD who have been admitted due to ongoing self harm and suicidality. A lot of these patients actually have insight (as they have no other co-morbid psychiatric illness) and so are admitted on an informal basis. 

Because of this I see the same pattern of care and management that’s started to really bother me. 

The patient’s self harm behaviours escalate on the ward due to being in a highly volatile, noisy, chaotic and sometimes traumatic environment. 

They become reliant on staff and demanding of their time and attention and when they do not receive this they again harm themselves or others. 

We eventually recognise that the inpatient stay is not benefiting the patient and try to work towards discharge. 

The patient does not want to be discharged and goes on leave and harms self significantly meaning the responsible clinician does not have confidence to go ahead with discharge. 

The cycle continues. Staff on the ward struggle and their ability to care for other patients is affected. They also struggle with the feeling that if they are too busy to give 1-1 time with these patients, they will likely harm themselves. 
Other patients also see dips in their mental state from the disruption. Hospital beds are blocked by patients that would be better managed in the community. And most importantly, the patient in question comes to more harm than if they were in the community. 

I hate this current model. I hate that our community services are not robust enough to manage these patients. I hate that we still rely on useless risk assessments to decide on admission because we fear the consequences. 

It all feels me with a sense of futility when we keep admitting these patients. I like psychiatry but I feel like if I did this for a sustained period of time this feeling of hopelessness would burn me out.",1665302107,psychiatry

Hey all, I just completed med school and is now planning to pursue psychiatry due to the following reasons.

I read a lot. I like classic works of fiction and most of my day is filled by reading and analyzing various authors.

I feel like the diseases of mind are the ones that challenge our identity and if I can help someone by giving comfort, I would.

I don't really like any other fields of medicine or surgery for that matter. Also I don't think psychopharmacology is effective for long term cure.

I am INTP as per MB personality type, I know it doesn't matter much, but I think I can give patients more detached empathetic advise without it affecting my mental status.

Also, I have read CG Jung and works of S Freud, and I am drawn in.

But, during my intership, my psychiatry postings were really bad. Psychiatry in my mind and what I have read was totally different to what was actually practising. I don't even like the classification of disorders (DSM), it feels too base. 
This is actually one of the reasons I want to take psychiatry, because  I could give some contribution to the field which is still lacking in complete understanding of mind.

Does these reasons resonate with you? Is this a right reason to pursue psychiatry? Or am I being too idealistic and will struggle to fit in the psychiatric world?

I've honestly never had a good time at any mental health practice, it never seems like they care about their patients whatsoever, but this just takes the cake. Not even going to get into how hard it's been getting stuff refilled anywhere else, it's uniquely bad here and I'm desperate. 

Every time I call the office, I'm on the line for at least 10 minutes. I am then prompted to leave a message, they NEVER actually answer the phone. They explicitly say in their voicemail that they won't respond to calls/confirm receipt of the message because of a ""high volume of calls."" They have a bit about how you are ""preventing other patients from receiving care"" if you call more than once, and they literally threaten to charge you a fee and even discharge you as a patient if you call more than once, but I have had to call after several days of the pharmacy not receiving a scrip I requested and there is always a problem that they need ME to solve. How was I supposed to know if I had not called? 

I've been trying to get my meds refilled for at least a week now, and have had to call several times to get more info. I've only talked to a real person once, it was a very sweet secretary who couldn't help me besides telling me that I need to have a visit with my doctor before she will refill my meds. The soonest she can see me is March 29th, a full 6 weeks from when I called.  She transferred me to the nurse practitioner's line, which hung up on me because it was during lunch hours or something. Also weirdly this line was ""no longer in service"" when I called back. I called back an hour later, waited on the line for 10+ minutes and THEN they let me leave a message. This was 3 days ago, never heard back. Don't expect to.

 I can't be without my medication for 6 weeks, I can't talk to anyone at the practice to get help, and I can't even switch practices because nobody is accepting new patients. I'm so tired of this, I'm honestly breaking down about it every day and I don't know what to do. Is there ANY way to get an emergency refill of Adderall, or anything I can do? I'm just lost right now. PLEASE do not go to this practice, I only ended up here because I moved in May and they were the only place accepting patients sooner than 3 months out. Turns out there is a reason for it, they are horrible. Awful, awful, awful, I cannot express how much it feels like they don't care about you. I'm so tired of this I'm so tired of the state of mental healthcare in this country and this practice is the epitome of not giving a fuck about the people they're supposed to be helping.",1676769183,psychiatry

I’m completely broken.

My mind has been harmed by their drugs, I was forced to take them against my will. Otherwise I would never touch this stuff. I hate the mental health system with a passion. 

I can’t speak, can’t hold a conversation. Can’t think complex thoughts. I’m in a constant state of nothingness, my sexual functioning has been devesated, gained unnecessary weight after being in good shape ruining my efforts, can’t feel emotions or life as fully and many more I’ll be here all day

I am so angry I can’t take the pain anymore, life is too difficult living like this and I don’t know how long I can last in this state. I’m off all the meds cold turkey so I’m dealing with crippling withdrawal. I blame psychiatry for ruining my life. You can’t just give these drugs like candy they are so powerful and dangerous.

The worst part of all of this is I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’ve lost all my passion, ambition and motivation which was all central to who I was. I’m just existing and not living.

08:15 Put on jeans and a shirt, contemplate eyeliner, apply eyeliner. Stunning. 

08:16: Read an article in which the mother of a young man with treatment-resistant schizophrenia laments the fact antipsychotics have side effects.

08:17: If psychiatry really worked, the medication would be 100% effective, 100% of the time, she concludes.

08:25: Make coffee and grab a cereal bar for the way. When out the flat have to go back in because I’ve forgotten my stethoscope. Just be honest with yourself, I think, and leave it at home. I throw it in my bag defiantly.

08:45: There’s an ambulance and three police cars outside the hospital. 8 policemen are in full body armour to deliver a patient to our intensive care ward. The patient is texting someone on his phone.

08:55: The ward sister informs me bed 7 has vomited once, bed 9’s BMs are slightly off and could it be that she’s been having too much cake, and bed 10 is angry because we agreed to reduce his haloperidol but the drug chart dose remains the same. Bed 11 is still AWOL since last week, and may have been spotted in Norwich. Could I check in with him?

08:58 The ward sister comes into the office with a stack of drug charts. Need rewriting, sorry.

09:00 The nurse doing morning meds comes in and tells me he needs the drug charts back because he’s doing morning meds. 

09:05 The patients have revolted in art therapy- one of them threw a paintbrush at the wall. 

09:10 The emergency response team shows up to the ward to defuse the situation. The patient relinquishes the weapon/paintbrush.

09:11 The patient doesn’t want PRN oral lorazepam, the nurse tells me. Could he have IM? I go to see the patient, who is now asleep.

09:20 Bed 7 has vomited once more. I examine him and determine he’s fine. I ask him what he ate yesterday, he replies a few bars of Xanax. 

09:45 Handover. All the patients are settled in mental state, ate and drank well, slept intermittently throughout the night and were pleasant on approach.

09:46 Except for patients in beds 1-16.

10:00 Consultant here for ward round.

10:02 Consultant has a tribunal so cannot round, asks if I can do it and discuss later.

10:05 Bed 4 has just started on clozapine, he doesn’t think he needs medication, he doesn’t think he’s ever been unwell, and if I wasn’t so stupid I would let him go. He’s a famous politician and he’s going to mobilise army troops against me. I add a mood stabiliser.

10:25 Bed 5 has just started on haloperidol, he doesn’t think he needs medication, he doesn’t think he’s ever been unwell, and if I wasn’t so stupid I would let him go. He’s a famous painter and he used to date the CEO of London Psychiatry. He’s going to get me fired. I add a mood stabiliser.

10:30: Really drawn to the idea of being fired, consider encouraging bed 5.

11:00 Bed 6 has just started on olanzapine, he doesn’t think he needs medication, he doesn’t think he’s ever been unwell, and if we weren’t so stupid we would let him go. He’s going to tell the Swedish CIA that their game isn’t working and he’s discovered their microchip. CAN YOU SEE IT, he asks. Call one of the nurses to stand next to me while I say no, I can’t. I rapidly increase olanzapine to maximum and think he will need clozapine. Then remember that he had that one spurious neutropaenia in 2006 which means the clozapine authority will need a striptease and a letter from a haematology consultant to authorise. 

11:20 Bed 6’s mum is here. She is furious her son is prescribed olanzapine when he was previously on aripiprazole. She says the aripiprazole didn’t work but had a much better side effect profile. 

11:30 Bed 6’s mum now crying about the cripplingly unfair nature of mental illness and how her son’s life has been taken over by schizophrenia. I try my best to deliver human warmth. 

11:45 She wants to know if olanzapine is going to make her son fat. It could, I say, and she wails. 

11:50 She has always admired psychologists.

12:00 Bed 1 is in seclusion and needs a review. Consultant still away- could I do the review and discuss on the phone after, call it a senior review, he wonders? But without actually calling, obviously.

12:15 The emergency response team are here. Bed 1 is naked and the whole seclusion room is smeared with poop. The Reducing Restrictive Practice nurse reprimands me when I suggest seclusion is likely to continue. Blank Slate, she says, menacingly.

12:30 Bed 1 doesn’t think he needs medication, he doesn’t think he’s ever been unwell, and if we weren’t so stupid we would let him go. I explain we’re trying to help him move out of this room into the open ward, from where discharge will be possible in future. He says that doesn’t fit in with his schedule.

12:35 Shockingly he takes his medication (valproate, risperidone, clonazepam, promethazine). That’s for you, sweetcheeks, he winks. 

12:40 Reducing restrictive practice nurse asks him if he’s going to punch people again if we take him off seclusion. I’m a fucking pacifist, he replies.

12:45 Reducing restrictive practice nurse adamant above comment is a legally binding decree and seclusion should terminate. We can manage on 2:1, she states.

12:55 No one wants to do 2:1 with bed 1 because he is a poop-thrower. 

13:00 Bed 1 throws poop at his 2:1. Reducing restrictive practice nurse adamant this is not a reason to initiate seclusion. I apologise to the team and advise waiting for the meds to kick in.

13:15 Pick up the afternoon bleep. Immediate bleep from the surgeons- bed 7 has schizophrenia, since today.

13:30 Bicker about whether Gladys who’s had a NOF is one of the extremely rare instances of very late onset schizophrenia. Surgeon wants to speak to my consultant. I hope she lets me know if she finds him.

13:45 The pharmacist wants me to immediately rewrite 7 drug charts.

13:50 Bleeped to a medical emergency- run; patient in status, nurses have placed an oxygen mask without connecting it to oxygen supply. They called me after a few minutes of seizing, didn’t want to bother me. I ask if the patient is known to have epilepsy. They don’t know and the ward reg is in clinic. I ask for lorazepam, and his drug chart. 

13:52 Extremely surprise myself by completing an A-E assessment, delivering buccal midazolam (I am not touching the rectal diazepam) and putting in a cannula. 

13:54 Where the fuck is my lorazepam?

13:55 Lorazepam given, seizure stops. Ambulance arrive. I escape with thanks. 

13:56 Bump into my consultant in the Foyer, waiting for his Uber Eats. He asks me if I’ve ordered in, too.

I am a medical student applying for residency this upcoming cycle. 

I was considering neurology vs. psychiatry previously, leaning towards neuro up until recently. In theory, I thought neurology was what I wanted to go into and catered my application with research and ops towards that. But I recently finished rotations in both, and I ended up enjoying my day to day of my psych rotation significantly more. I now want to apply to psychiatry.

However, NOW I am worried my application is going to look much more heavily focused on neurology than psychiatry and that will put me in a detriment when my application is being looked at (because they might think I chose psychiatry as a backup, etc.. I've been told there's a risk of that).

1732,Tales from a PA in psychiatry,141,13x19vk,Noctor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Noctor/comments/13x19vk/tales_from_a_pa_in_psychiatry/,37,"Recently discovered this sub, and it has been so eye-opening for me. Especially some of the outrageous stories of mismanagement of psychiatric medications by mid-level providers. This may get rambly,  but I want to share some of my experiences from my fresh-out-of-school job as a telehealth PA, before I had a complete breakdown and took a LOA and eventually quit after 18 months.

I graduated from PA school at the end of 2019, so just before COVID. I chose to pursue PA over medical school because I thought it would be a great way have work-life balance but still provide patient care, and honestly I preferred the thought of having a supervising physician to being the one with the final word. 

I was eventually hired by a startup private practice psychiatry clinic, doing exclusively telehealth at that point. It was 3 psychiatrists each working 8-12 hours a week (with a plan to eventually quit their day jobs). I was hired as their first PA, to work full time, with the plan that one of the MDs would be available to call or message with any questions.  I was nervous about it, and looking back should have listened to my gut. My ""interview"" was a joke, it seemed like they would have taken anyone and weren't at all concerned when I asked how they felt about supervising a new grad off-site. One said he could tell I had a good heart (""heart of a nurse?""), that was the most important thing because he could teach me the medicine but not how to care about people. I was flattered and reassured (I know, I know), and I was genuinely interested in psych and thought I would learn a lot from these docs. I was still nervous, but figured I would start with easier cases and lots of support, and could refer more complicated cases to them. Plus I was kinda burying my head in the sand because I would need to start paying back my loans soon. 

Well, it turns out, I was seeing anything and everything on my own from the beginning, and not once did one of them agree to see one of my complicated patients for a follow-up/consultation, I stopped even bothering to ask. Any time I brought up that some cases seemed out of my scope or more appropriate for an MD, I was at best told I needed to be more confident and at worst made to feel like I was a problem. And the ""support"" I got from them when I had clinical questions was quite lacking. 2 of them were sometimes helpful but hard to get a hold of and often checked out, and the 3rd was downright hostile, often wouldn't even meaningfully answer my question, and made me cry several times. I quickly became afraid to ask questions and would only do so as a last resort. 

So many instances where, despite being  (I think) a fairly fast learner, conscientious,  and aware of my limitations, I am sure I was misdiagnosing, inappropriately treating and /or under-treating because I was afraid to make any med changes for fear of being wrong and making things worse. It's so hard because I didn't know what I didn't know, so it's hard to know just how bad it was. At least this practice didn't see kids. 

Just one example that comes to mind (don't recall details sorry): mid 20s male with OCD and severe MDD witg past episodes of psychotic features, not taking any medications at that time but had previously tried SO many meds and cocktails and had a bad experience so was reluctant to try any meds again, wanted a ""second opinion"" specifically to see if he would be a good candidate for TMS or ketamine treatment. I had heard. A little bit about both and was interested to learn more, but certainly didn't feel qualified to assess or counsel a patient about them. I reviewed his intake form the morning before his appointment and recognized that this was out of my depths. I then saw that one of the MDs had an open slot for an intake that same afternoon. This MD even had listed ECT and TMS among his special interests so it seemed like a great fit. I called to ask if he would be willing to see the patient, and he flat out told me there was no need for that, I am a provider and therefore am perfectly qualified, if I didn't feel I knew enough about these treatments I should read about them. I said of course I would love to read about these topics, but didn't have time to read enough to be prepared for this patient that day. He brushed it off and then emailed me a PowerPoint presentation about TMS from a conference he had gone to 2 years before. When we hung up I cried, had a panic attack over lunch, but muddled my way through the appointment, literally reading the PowerPoint slides as I was ""educating"" the patient. The patient and mom ended up happy because I ""listened,"" but I feel like I totally wasted their time and money. 

By the way, I also ""learned"" from this same psychiatrist to use seroquel as a PRN for anxiety and sleep, and that it was much better than hydroxyzine which was ""useless."" Not really blaming him; the real problem is that I didn't have the knowledge or training to know to question or verify this advice. 

Then within 6 months of me starting the 2 checked-out MDs both abruptly quit, and I was left inheriting ALL of their patients. The remaining MD had been doing 1 clinical day a week but instead of increasing that to pick up some of the slack, he REDUCED his hours to a half day, and passed some of his patients on to me. His plan was now to hire more mid-levels and phase out of clinical practice entirely so he could be ""available"" for supervision. They hired 2 PAs (one from Family Med, one from Emergency Med) and a new grad psych NP. I kid you not, the ""training"" for each of these people was to shadow me (a PA with less than a year experience plus a 4 week psych rotation) for a week. 

They then hired a more experienced psych NP who was very eager to mentor me. I'm sure some of the advice she gave me may have been good, but looking back I'm sure it was the blind leading the blind. She mainly talked to me a lot about ""imposter syndrome"" and reassured me she read my notes and could see I provided ""exceptional care"". Who knows, maybe I wasn't terrible but I am certain I wasn't exceptional. And even calling it ""imposter syndrome"" feels inappropriate because that implies I was actually qualified for the job I was doing, and I don't think I was. ""Imposter syndrome"" was really just having a conscience.  

Now, as a PA in family practice, things are better but still rough. I live in an ""independent practice"" state which the doctors and other midlevels at my clinic seem to like, but it feels wrong to me. My coworkers are all very nice, but they are so burnt out and overbooked. The clinic has 8 midlevels and only 4 docs 1 of whom is retiring and 1 is very part time. A lot of times when I have questions the only people around to ask are other PAs, which is probably OK most of the time but not great. 

I am also grappling with it feeling wrong for me to be a patient's ""primary care provider."" I am proud of my degree and being a PA, but I don't think it prepared me to be the ""provider"" someone sees instead of ever seeing a doctor.  I had envisioned more of an ""extender"" role.  Of course, I knew what I signed up for, and I'm not saying the other PAs I work with aren't good at what they do.  I just feel like I am a kid playing doctor. Meanwhile,  a new grad PA just started and she fits right in, is very confident and already asking to see a full schedule (I dragged my feet on that as long as I could). So maybe I'm the problem,  and medicine just isn't right for me. I am also dealing with pretty significant postpartum depression and anxiety right now (went back to work 2 months ago), so i am sure my judgement is clouded and I shouldn't make major career decisions right now. The thought of switching careers after just 3 years is horrifying but so is the thought of staying. 

I guess my point is, I don't think I have the delusions huge ego of a Noctor, but nonetheless I feel like I have acted like one (faking it til I make it, learning on the job, making mistakes) because that seems to be what our health care system pushes me to be. I wonder how many PAs and NPs out there feel the same.",1685574579,psychiatry

Like essentially they have a bunch of different meds and conditions . 
It's literally as complicated as a Sweet Store Owner .
Then they just have to remember Dosages and  Contraindications. 

I know they also have studied real medicine but they would just refer you to a real doctor for any real medical problems. 

But you could essentially learn in under a month what a Psychiatrist does???
And the basics you could learn in a Day .

Its interesting to note  also that Psychiatrists have none of the Responsibilities of Neurosurgeons .
I.e. look at the painstaking effort a Neorosurgeon goes through to not damage ,say ,your Speech or Music Areas , when removing a tumour - they literally do a surgery while the patient is playing the instrument. 
But Psychiatrists are literally like Surgeons who couldn't give a flying fuck - go in and destroy whatever and what's worse us they dont even have proof that a tumour ( or in this case Mental Illness ) is present !!",1652458576,psychiatry
1741,Medical Student considering psychiatry a little mystified by this community.,7,vd99tr,Antipsychiatry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/vd99tr/medical_student_considering_psychiatry_a_little/,317,"While I think there are certainly valid criticisms that can be made of the field, it's unclear to me how seriously to take the concerns espoused in this community given the breadth of the accusations. I was just reading some post about someone saying discontinuing their SSRI caused their genitals to shrink-- that has never been reported in the medical literature, and if it did in fact happen, is a case report waiting to happen if there is in fact proof. (Truthfully, I have my doubts that there is proof.)


Specifically, I'm interested in the ire directed towards SSRIs as I think these have a very solid evidence base behind them. What specifically are the grievances this community has? I'll try to respond to as many people as I can / maintain conversations to the best of my bandwidth as a fairly busy med student.


EDIT: Wanted to call attention to this comment of the most reasonable grievance I've seen so far, https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/vd99tr/medical_student_considering_psychiatry_a_little/icj54f8/


My verdict right now is probably 95% of people here are just severely misinformed and thus I probably don't need to take this community super seriously. I know this isn't the outcome y'all probably wanted, and me saying things so bluntly definitely didn't help. I'll keep reading comments and probably reply to more than I should just bc of my own personality but unless there are more ppl like the comment I linked it's dubious my opinion will change


EDIT2: Have fat fingers and accidentally marked too many things as read. If i've called you a reasonable person but not replied to one of your comments, please bump me! (sorry)


EDIT3: If you start talking about withdrawal symptoms I've already addressed this in other comments


EDIT4: please stop dm'ing me about covid vaccine theories. am entirely uninterested in having that conversation

EDIT5: I think I've lost interest in this... a few (3-4) more reasonable people have emerged since last night, but my DMs about covid etc have increased exponentially. cheers yall


EDIT 6: **I perhaps overestimated a community's ability to stay on topic and I'm ignoring a lot of responses but hate the idea of people wasting time typing, so wanted to put it in the body. Psychiatry can and does harm people. Antipsychotics are associated with brain shrinkage, and cognitive dysfunction. Generally speaking, psychosis is associated with worse brain shrinkage and cognitive dysfunction, so psychiatrists believe they are helping people with antipsychotics - the lesser of two evils. However, these are murky waters. There is plenty of room to criticize psychiatry for this. I agree with much of that criticism. But the purpose of this post was to litmus test this community. SSRIs are much less equivocal. That is why this post was about SSRIs - to see how nuanced this community could be / whether it was worth keeping up with. If people understood risk/benefits of SSRIs, they would be generally for them as the evidence is overwhelming. If that was the case, I could then engage in a mature discussion about real dangers psychiatry can cause- antipsychotics being an example. Unfortunately, I have not found that to be the case. The majority of users here are severely misinformed, and thus I don't think the learning I could gain from this community is particularly time efficient - I'm better off in other patient experience subreddits that do stick closer to the facts if I want to be a better doctor.**

With that out of the way. I was on Facebook this morning and noticed a friend that usually like's my post hadn't done so in a while. So I go to her page just to find the dreaded ""rip""  ""she'll be missed.""  She was a lovely woman and I always appreciated her takes on life. She reminded me of myself in some ways, a person with their trauma's just trying to get by in life. She was beautiful and kind to people from all walks a life, which always surprised me because she was pretty well off finically. but she seemed like a cool person  


I knew she drank, and i knew she took psych meds (she talked about benzo's for sleeping) and right before she passed she posted a picture of her ketamine prescription.    


This had me thinking that her doctors probably had her on a poly pharmacy of drugs, in a sense they were most likely her drug dealer. If it wasn't ketamine or benzo's what else were they prescribing her?  


In my younger years I was a victim of the poly drugging from the terrible profession, they had me on  6 different drugs. it was pathetic, if I hadn't quit taking them i probably would have ended up dead myself.     


It's crazy we don't question these things. Very few people realize the harm this awful profession is doing. I feel like my friend would be hear toady if she would have stayed far from the doors of psychiatrist.

Zugewanderte Ärzte mit arabischem Hintergrund meinten das sie nur am Anfang in die Psychiatrie gehen weil man da sicher einen Platz bekommt, sich danach aber schnell was anderes suchen. Nun handelt es sich hier natürlich nur um die Erfahrungen einzelner Leute und man sollte das nicht übergeneralisieren, aber es scheint zumindest ein Stück weit was dran zu sein.

1782,Freundin in die Psychiatrie geschickt,261,nflbrv,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/nflbrv/freundin_in_die_psychiatrie_geschickt/,94,"Hallo Brudis,

Es folgt ein langer Text aber ich weiß nicht was ich machen soll, ich habe meine Freundin gerade mehr oder weniger ""freiwillig"" einweisen lassen.

Sie leidet quasi seit Jahren an Depressionen, aber in den letzten Monaten ist es besonders schlimm geworden. Dadurch dass sie unwissend in einen Betrugsfall reingeraten ist aus dem sie finanziell nicht raus kommt, ist sie gezwungen Insolvenz anzumelden (haben mehrere Anwälte klar empfohlen).
Ihr Leben ist leider voll mit solcher Scheiße die ihr passiert und unglaublich viel Pech in allen Bereichen für die sie oft wirklich nichts kann.
Die Diagnose schwere Depression hat sie dann vor kurzem erhalten weil sie auf der Arbeit auch nicht mehr funktioniert hat und die letzten 2-3 Wochen nach Therapeuten und Tageskliniken gesucht mit mäßigem Erfolg, obwohl sie zeitnah Hilfe bräuchte.

Ff zu heute: ein erneuter finanzieller Schicksalsschlag hat nachmittags zu einem kompletten Meltdown geführt und ich sie hat zum ersten Mal klare Aussagen hinsichtlich ""ich kann und will so nicht mehr leben"" geäußert.
Sie hat danach paar Stunden geschlafen aber danach ging es abends weiter, samt Geschreie, erneuten Äußerungen in Richtung Suizid und dem Einsperren auf der Toilette.

Zu dem Zeitpunkt konnte ich auch nicht mehr und habe 112 gewählt und innerhalb kürzester Zeit waren Polizei, Krankenwagen und Feuerwehr da.
Ihr hat das absolut gar nicht gefallen und mir klar gesagt dass sie mich hasst dafür und dass sie sich niemals stationär einweisen will und wird...
Nach langem Gespräch mit Polizei und Krankenhelfer ist sie dann mitgekommen, aber nur weil die Polizei klar gesagt hat dass die Alternative Zwangseinweisung wäre.

Nun sitze ich hier alleine und sie schreibt mir aus der Klinik dass sie da nicht bleiben will, ihr kann eh keiner helfen, ""außer mit Drogen zupumpen und Dauerschlaf wird sich eh nichts ändern"". Wegen dem Kontrollverlust (Insolvenz, Einweisung) und Hass auf alle fragt sie mich ""was ist das für ein Leben"" und ich weiß nicht was ich machen soll.

Ich habe Angst um sie, ich habe Angst dass sie morgen oder so einfach nach Hause geht weil sie freiwillig da ist. Ich habe Angst dass sie nach Hause kommt und der Spaß wieder von vorne geht oder sie auf dem Weg nach Hause vor den Zug springt.

Kann sie doch zwangsweise da behalten werden falls die Psychologen merken sie ist nicht stabil bzw suizidgefährdet? Was soll ich machen, einfach Vertrauen in die Klinik haben? Kann Leuten geholfen werden die schon aufgegeben haben?
Bin am Ende und die Nacht wird wohl auch eher schlaflos...
Danke für jede Hilfe!",1621369746,psychiatry

&#x200B;

I have noticed a trend in my personal life and in my professional career that many psychiatrists and clinical psychologists commonly disagree with diagnoses and scope of the licensed clinical social workers.

&#x200B;

My question is how and why are social workers able to diagnose mental health conditions? 

&#x200B;

Don't psychiatrist and psychologists have to do years of post-doctorate education & training to be able to do DX mental health disorders? 

How knowledgeable/trained are lcsws in Diagnosing with just a masters degree and a year long internship? 

How can a lcsw blanketly without neuro psych or psychiatrist testing make a mental/behavioral health Dxs? Are they trained dx other medical conditions as well?  How far does this go or can go?

&#x200B;

In my mind this is like a physical therapist diagnosing an Achilles tendon tear or ruptured bursa. Yes, I am sure the PT knows based on certain physical therapy exams and assessments that a patient has a musculoskeletal injury but its not like they can bill insurances for this or know for sure without the requisite MEDICAL testing to give such Dx .

Note; I am a D.V.M. . I see a psychiatrist on a semi regular basis for actual talk therapy and a rare med refill.  I am typing this out because my psychiatrist expressed frustration for lcsws today due to haphazard ill thought upon mental health/ psychiatric diagnoses. 

She complained of how the lcsws strike fear into patients when the lcsw tells the patient they now have to see the psychiatrist now a possible cluster B personality disorder or clinical depression. That lcsws really should not be Dx anything and should just be trying to improve the social determinants of health for their patients. I actually agree with her on this. 

&#x200B;

Simply put dow does an lcsw come to these DXs without being a physician? Many other professions cannot DXs conditions as such given the PT example.

Some of these substances have side effects. But, most of them are minor when compared to the side effects of most SSRIs, NRIs, stimulants, and anxiolytics.

I understand there are circumstances in which traditional psychiatric medications are needed. But I'm sure in many cases patients would benefit from taking some supplements or nootropics first.

I mean: instead of giving that depressed kid an SSRI that kills his libido, why not try a regimen of high-dose fish oil, coupled with therapy? If it doesn't work of course the psychiatrist might prescribe fluoxetine. But why not try this natural, low-risk, and effective supplement first?

Why not give the anxious man some ashwagandha instead of some dangerous anxiolytic? Why not give sabroxy to the kid with ADHD, before ritalin or atomoxetine?

I was either feeling guilty about something I said or I would be wishing I said something. Painful days those were. I think it was a mixture of low self esteem, lack of self confidence and anxiety that was crippling me. 
However this year, I discovered the emotion wheel on Instagram. And below the picture they had captioned it with a text encouraging people to feel the emotions that they have at the time. Turns out I have always avoided my feelings, I would never process any emotions, hence, I had a lot of bottled up feelings. It was really bad, I am still scared of getting back to that point ever in my life. 
So this year, beginning in March, I have been very intentional about feeling every bit of emotions that crosses my mind in every event. I don’t let any small wind of frustration, happiness, guilt, shame, name them, to pass. I process each and analyze the cause, and feel it spread out inside my body, whether it’s the chest, stomach , or head and even my cheeks! Then I let it pass. I find that I am more of myself after processing the feelings.

It can make you see things that aren’t there or just like out of the corner of your eye.

Can make you see weird patterns and lighting blots but if you do tell doctors about it this one.

Makes you feel like you not in your body and you can see yourself. Make it feel like your almost in a dream state.

Can cause sleeping problems like insomnia.

It can make it when you wake up you don’t know where you are.

It can make you feel like thoughts are not one own but that is rare.

It can make you feel hopeless and lost.

It can make you distant from others like not wanting to be around people or make you want to be closer to them.

It can make you more irritable and annoyed.

It Can cause mood swing but only explainable ones.

It can make you more aware of what is happening in your surroundings or to your body.

It can make you hear things that aren’t there. Like someone’s voice or just a weird sound.

That all I can remember for now if I can think of anymore I’ll let you know. Remember that anxiety can pretty much do anything to the body and it is very aggravating and can make you feel like you have a serious condition. If you guys have anymore symptoms comment them bellow. Remember and try to stick with the facts that some diseases we are afraid of are very rare and try to avoid the what if.

Do not google anything you experience it pops up with the worst. Just googling muscle weakness is mind destroying and scary and they always put the worst first. If you guys ever feel alone or scared you can dm me I am happy to help.

Edit: thanks to someone in the comments the pointed out a mistake I made.

You can also get coldness it your fingers and toes.

You can also grind your teeth in your sleep causing tmj but that is easily treatable and in most cases fix themselves 

Also can make you have nightmares and dream a lot more even if the dreams don’t make sense and are random.

It also can cause night sweats

It increases the acid production in stomach which causes indigestion, heartburn, stomach uncomfortness.

It impacts on the balance of good and bad bacteria in gut.

It causes stomach gas even if you eat the right food.

It inputs alot in existing problem like IBS.

Also you can feel your heartbeat in the ears and feel it anywhere on the body.

Edit: These are symptoms of anxiety not a diagnosis but if your going through a troubling time and have been under a lot of stress and anxiety then these can relate but if they come out of no where not scared at all. Setup a visit with your gp and still there might be nothing wrong. It is ok to not feel good sometimes doesn’t mean you are dying of a terrible illness.

Also don’t be afraid to ask a gp even while you are stress. They will help a lot and if they don’t they aren’t a good gp,",1596488431,anxiety
1812,My tips for men dealing with performance anxiety / erectile dysfunction,72,ewsabl,MensLib,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/ewsabl/my_tips_for_men_dealing_with_performance_anxiety/,17,"This bothered me A LOT during the past years, and I felt like I can't really talk about it to anybody. I always felt this is not the kind of story I can talk to my male friends about.

Today I feel like I've gained significant knowledge about this subject and would like to share it with other guys who experience the same thing and don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

# A little bit about me:

I'm a straight male, 29, dealing with performance anxiety for the past 9 years. I met my first girlfriend when I was 21, we were each other's first, and we were together for nearly 4 years. When we first tried to have sex, I experienced what I now know as performance anxiety. After experiencing it a few more times with her, we basically gave up and our sex life was based on oral and touching each other.

She hinted she wants actual sex a few times, but I didn't want to confront anxiety again so I ignored the messages, and after 3.5 years she dumped me for someone else.

After this relationship, I realized I'm now 25, I'm about to date women who are 23-25 and I'm not even sure I can even have sex. I felt extremely insecure and only dated women I didn't care about.

That & a lot of reading helped me learn about my sexuality and how to deal with this thing. Since then I've had some more relationships and sexual partners, and while I don't think I'll ever be able to make PA completely disappear, I can control how it affects me and how I handle it, and today I can definitely say nothing is wrong with me, and I can have penetrative sex once I feel ready.

**Note:** I'm not an expert or a therapist, so just sharing my own experiences & learnings about myself.

Let's go.

# Tips for Dealing Performance Anxiety / Erectile Dysfunction

**Tip #1: Learn what your problem actually is & what's causing it**

Most often, this problem is caused because you're stressed. But why are you stressed? You'll need to do some inner thinking to answer that. Talking to supportive people is great for that. Therapy is also a good solution to help you understand things. mindfulness and meditation might be extremely helpful. Choose what feels right for you.

I realized I experienced it for different reasons with different partners, for example:

\- I was stuck in a loop: I was stressed that every time would be just the same as it was until this point

\- We didn't have chemistry so I didn't feel safe with her

\- She talked about her expectations / past sexual partners and it made me nervous

\- She was inexperienced and I felt I need to perform well to not let her down

\- I wasn't very attracted to her so I felt anxiety that I won't be able to keep it hard enough

and so on...

It's important to identify the problem as it will help you make a good decision. For example, if you're not very attracted to her, don't do something you don't want. If you don't feel safe, wait until you do. Sounds basic, but only after going through that.

&#x200B;

**Tip #2: Avoid moving forward before you feel comfortable enough**

It doesn't make you less manly to wait with having sex. If you don't feel it's right, just don't do it. Stay in your safe zone until you feel the desire to take a step out of it. Communicate that you're not ready & want to take things slow if this is how you feel.

&#x200B;

**Tip #3: Be honest & share your concerns before getting sexual**

I felt that this really helps me feel safe with women.

With my most recent partner, After a few dates she invited me over. While we were half naked in her bed, I told her I'm not ready for penetrative sex and talked to her about my performance anxiety, she responded very positively, and assured me it's ok.

The next time we met, I told her that I'm still not sure I'm ready, and after she responded the same way, I felt so safe with her that I immediately felt ready for sex.

In case she's not really understanding, and doesn't make you feel safe, don't sleep with her, and you won't have to deal with anxiety. Problem solved.

&#x200B;

**Tip #4: reduce some pressure by making her enjoy herself**

While your anxiety can take control of your erection, it probably won't control your finger or tongue performance. Try to master your foreplay & oral game. Once your partner enjoys herself, especially if she reaches orgasm, you'll probably care less about your performance later.

&#x200B;

**Tip #5: If you need some extra help, pills might be a good solution**

If you're feeling safe, attracted, want to move forward with this person, and the only thing stopping you is your stress and desire to please your partner, Viagra might be a good solution. I felt super weird taking it while I was 26, but it helped me overcome it.

**Important**: Don't get dependent on it. I recommend only using it once or twice with a new partner.

&#x200B;

**Tip #6: It gets better!**

For me, performance anxiety only happens with a new partner. I believe that it's true for most people, because after you have sex a few times with a partner and you're both enjoying it, you're less likely to be stressed the next time.

&#x200B;

**Tip #7: Take it easy, and some last notes**

\- It's way more common than you think.

\- Nobody really gives a shit. Not even your partners. The person who cares about it the most is probably you, and this is a mental challenge you can overcome yourself.

\- Use it for your benefit. While sometimes it would be a real mental struggle, it will also help you identify partners that are not meant for you and save you months or years of dating the wrong person.

And after a few years of treating my body very poorly with bad diet, minor alcoholism and drugs - my world came crashing down (literally: I got a bad case of derealization).

Basically my whole family is on SSRI's and anti-anxiety meds, but I refused to take any meds before I had tried to give it my ALL on fixing it naturally.

And it worked. Fixing my anxiety became my full-time job, and I’m completely cured.

I used to not be able to get out of the house, now I’m able to travel all over the world.I’m not saying this will work for everyone, but a lot of us don’t respond well to medication and therapy - and this worked for me.

**Here’s the step-by-step BREAK THE GLASS emergency toolkit habit stack I used:**

**1. Accepting my anxiety.** Read Hope and Help for Your Nerves, by Dr Claire Weekes

**2. Exposure therapy:** Expose yourself to your worst fear, REGULARLY. For me this meant taking a crowded bus every single day, and then one day flying alone (TERRIFYING! But a major key in my journey)

**3. Doing cold therapy and breath work:** A lot of you have heard of Wim Hof. In my experience, it works. I feel super zen after a cold shower and some breath work exercises.

**4. Exercising (almost) every single day.** A lot of anxiety is excess adrenaline. Burn it off by getting your heart rate up.

**5. Diet:** Stop eating food that makes you feel like shit. Look up nutritional strategies for easing anxiety.

**6. Organize your thoughts**. Have a system for storing all your thoughts and to-do’s. Look up «Zen to Done» by Leo Babauta.

**7. Journaling.** Write a stream of consciousness of your negative thoughts every night before going to bed. Doing this makes it feel like the paper takes the burden off your shoulders.

**8. Skipping on coffee (for a while)**. I stopped drinking coffee for 6 months and replaced it with tea. Coffee can create a lot of inflammation and adrenaline in your body, which is great for being productive (but not for your anxiety and sleep).

**9. Sleep well.** Get sunlight in your eyes as soon as you wake up (or light therapy), calm down 1-2 hours before bed and go to bed in a dark, chill room without any screens. If you struggle with sleep anxiety (like I did), read «The Sleep Book» by Dr Guy Meadows.

That’s it!

A lot of people have unintentionally self-inflicted anxiety caused by a poor lifestyle, and this is what turned my life around from saying «when I die, I will finally be able to rest» to my gf and now LOVING every single day and being super grateful for everything.

Trust me, don’t kick it unless you’ve tried it for at least 4 months!",1697015925,anxiety

You get the idea - it’s all of those situations where all eyes are on you and you have to speak. In those situations, you may get a rush of fight-or-flight symptoms like heart racing, sweating, shaking, voice quivering, breathlessness, mind going blank, diarrhea, passing out and other bodily symptoms. The symptoms feel uncontrollable and may lead to a full-on panic attack where you have to run from the room. This leads to a spiral of shame, confusion and humiliation. It’s very painful and debilitating. Depending how severe it is, it can make it impossible to graduate from school, interview for jobs, be in relationships and advance your career.

When anxiety prevents you from achieving your life goals and decreases your quality of life - that’s when it becomes an Anxiety Disorder. Disorder just means that it’s getting in the way of your happiness and functioning. There should be no stigma around disorders - they should be viewed similarly to a physical illness that gets in the way of your functioning.

1932,CMV: The normalisation of social anxiety is breeding social anxiety,3659,fun1lr,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fun1lr/cmv_the_normalisation_of_social_anxiety_is/,221,"*EDIT: I must clarify that I do not believe this is the ONLY cause of the rise in anxiety. Obviously, as with almost every issue faced by the world, there are MANY factors that affect global mental health*

To start, I have OCD and panic disorder. I do not suffer from anxiety, however, I’d say I understand feeling anxious, and suffering from a mental illness more than the average neurotypical person. I’m not trying to ridicule anyone with social anxiety or any forms of anxiety disorder. I am NOT saying that normalisation is inherently bad.

Social anxiety is a very real very valid mental illness. People would most certainly still suffer from social anxiety regardless of if we had a label for it/ if people were vocal about their experiences. 

However, I believe there is a reason social anxiety seems to be the most common form of anxiety, particularly in the current rising generations. We talk about it non-stop. Social anxiety has been normalised to the point where it’s considered ‘not relatable’ if you don’t have it.  

Check out any form of social media and you will find comments making jokes about how they’re ‘too scared to order food’ or ‘too scared to answer calls’.  YouTube skits, Instagram memes, tweets and such are centred around this, it has become embedded into the culture. I would like to state social media at this point, for this rising generation (16-25) is clearly a given for each individual person to have and use to communicate effectively. Therefor it is not a sampling of only introverted/anxious people, but the general population. 

I believe the constant rehashing of social anxiety and the issues associated with it are bringing unfounded fears to the forefront of people’s minds. They hear flocks of people say things such as “I’m too scared to order my food, what if the waiter judges me.” &amp; They in turn think “Oh, I’ve never thought of that. Will the waiter judge me? Should I be thinking about that?” And rinse &amp; repeat with several social anxiety issues, until these fears are imbedded in the whole populous.

There has to be a reason that social anxiety seems to be growing so rapidly when other forms of anxiety are not. To me it seems clear that is due to the normalisation of it.

I suffer from panic attacks over a fear of being killed (among many other things). The fear of terrorism (planes) and general apocalypse level things is a common trigger for me. I logically understand these are unfounded fears. When I hear a particularly loud plane overhead and start freaking out, I remind myself of this (that it is my mental illness causing this fear, that I am not in danger it’s just an imbalance of chemicals in my brain bla bla bla), and instruct others to do so as well if they wish to help me. It doesn’t always stop a panic attack, but it certainly seems to shorten them or give me a sense of hope that they will be over soon, it’s just my brain messing up.

When someone is socially anxious, there’s seems to be a culture of ‘understanding’ their anxiety. Like it is integral to make them feel supported and understood. One must say “I understand why you might feel this way, it is very scary to talk to the person at the cash register. I’m here for you.” Or alternatively, “I’ll do it for you.” This seems like it almost takes their fears and in some way makes them reality for everyone around them. Like instead of blaming social anxiety on an illness, it’s an accepted response to the world we live in. It seems like this normalisation of the response to anxiety could be making these fears seem logical in the minds of people who otherwise wouldn’t of thought to fear some forms of socialisation.

I want to make it clear. I am NOT saying we shouldn’t comfort people with social anxiety or do any of the above. I am NOT saying we should treat people with social anxiety that way that helps me. I suffer with a different illness, I am a different person. Things are different. 

I am simply saying the reason the way we handle social anxiety right now is making it more likely for other people to develop the illness, because it’s embedding it into our culture as a norm, instead of as a serious illness that needs assistance. I think this could cause a lot of troubles in even neurotypical people, and could be changing the scape of what is a ‘normal’ fear. 

Maybe there is no other way to handle social anxiety; maybe there is. I’m no expert. 

I just think neurotypical people should be on the look out to remember social anxiety is an illness, and the worries of the mentally ill don’t have to be adopted by you, work hard to resist the temptation that fear has on all of us; I suppose. 

Idk, do you think social anxiety rates are stagnant, maybe this is all anecdotal evidence? Change my view.

*Edit: wording ‘growing’ ‘stagnant’*

*Edit: OCD is not a form of anxiety as of 2014 as per the DSM. Please stop telling me it is in the comments. Regardless, I was referring to GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) which is widely recognised as manifesting completely differently to OCD, even before they separated OCD and Anxiety officially.*

**Edit: I think I’ve slight changed my view? I don’t believe it’s the normalisation of the ILLNESS that cause it’s growth, more likely the normalisation of unhealthy coping mechanisms (avoiding socialisation etc) that has spread to people who otherwise wouldn’t of found it socially acceptable to indulge in those behaviours. I don’t think social anxiety is treated enough as a serious debilitating illness (like depression and OCD are) so people refrain from highlighting how absolutely dangerous it is to use those unhealthy coping mechanisms. Instead we just get memes about being to scared to answer the phone. Imagine if we were to get similar memes about cutting? It would be a stark difference.**

**And that’s not to say there’s anything WRONG with joking about mental illness, I think it’s important. But it’s only a viable option if it is first taken seriously, which social anxiety is not. I’d like social anxiety similar to agoraphobia which is taken MUCH more seriously, but no one sees the avoidance of ever leaving the house as something to joke about instead of help someone get over.**",1585973074,anxiety

I’m thinking of having her try something calm and relaxing like Animal Crossing, but was wondering if any of you have other suggestions. Thanks !

EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions i’ll take a look, Hopefully she'll enjoy a few :)

EDIT 2: after looking at the games i’m going to have her see how she likes Stardew Valley, A short hike, Kirby, and Tetris.

I’ve been in several situations where other’s lives were in danger, and I seem to “snap to” immediately in those instances. It’s like my anxiety disappears, I suddenly have a crystal clear mind and handle those situations really well. At least, according to first responders that have responded to the 911 calls I’ve had to make. 

After the situation is sorted, I’ll emotionally break down from being suddenly hit by the stress of what happened, and I’ll be on a stress-comedown as I call it for days to a week sometimes. When it’s a bad situation (even if it’s dangerous) but not life threatening, I’ll be an anxious mess. The moment it’s crosses to an emergency though, I become shockingly rational, am able to direct others to help as well, and I guess take over when a situation is hectic and nobody knows what to do/does anything. It makes no sense to me, so I’m wondering if other people with anxiety have this response too.

My husband and me got credit alerts this morning and something was off… long story short, our nine year old went last night and got my husband’s Amex card and charged $1500 on games and other stuff. I’m still sorting through it.

My husband is livid. We confronted him about it and he tried to blame his baby sister, then he confessed. He had to go to school and so we put him on the bus and said we would talk about it once we got home and after school.

My husband was super angry and wanted to have a conversation with me about giving him a spanking, but we’ve never done that before and I don’t want to hurt him. He got his chromebook taken away and I’m trying to think what other alternatives we can do. My husband has calmed down but he REALLY wants to use physical punishment. We’re arguing about it over text right now. I don’t like hearing my child cry but my husband is saying that he needs it and as long as it’s reserved for extreme situations.

And the seriousness of the situation is not lost on me; I want to handle it correctly because stealing is wrong and he knows that. I just don’t want to traumatize him.

Does anyone here do physical punishment and is it effective?

Edit: I really hate this blame game. There’s a lot of seemingly blaming comments from Brady Bunch perfect parents who are judging me for lack of supervision- that’s not what happened at all. I was asleep and he has never done this before so we don’t put away the wallets. My purse is on my chair and his wallet was on the nightstand. Jesus Christ. I just had a baby and it’s been hard balancing two children and me and my husband really do try. All this shaming is too much. I don’t mind constructive criticism but stop telling me I don’t watch my kid or that I was going to let my husband “beat him”. That’s not what was going to happen. In both our households growing up, spankings were controlled and were done the old fashioned way. Not in anger. 

And I’m not going to ask to punch my husband. Jesus.

Edit 2: just giving an update. He was not spanked; but we both spoke to him in his room. It was not pretty- he threw a tantrum and cried when we took the electronics away. No dessert as well. And he was sent to bed early without TV time. This weekend we’re going to come up with a chore game plan. I’ll probably use a plan for him.

Definitely a rough night; husband still was not happy but he still went in there and comforted/cuddled him and said he wasn’t going to hurt him.

Stressful night.",1675445124,anxiety

Looking back though that explains why when I had my manic episode last year I felt aggressive being in public like every noise would piss me off. It was like I just had zero tolerance for any frustration

I didn’t know it made you lose sleep, wonder how long it’s been fucking with that

I didn’t know hypomania was what I was experiencing since I was a teen and would go through those days/weeks of feeling really happy again

Funnily enough, I used to write about mania before I knew that was what I was experiencing 

I remember drawing myself on my bed surrounded by a sunny beach

That’s what it felt like

Being in paradise, untouchable, unbreakable, everything is perfect and exactly right and wonderful and beautiful

No sleep but plenty of motivation

Reorganizing my room at 3 am or going out for night runs

I miss that feeling but I know it can never last 

There always comes the depression

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that can be associated with marked changes in activity and energy levels and extreme mood variation, from depression through to hypomania and mania. The condition can result in physical health problems and difficulties functioning in work, school or relationships. But, critically, with optimal treatment, care and empowerment, people with bipolar disorder can and do flourish and have good quality of life.
 
CREST.BD uses a pioneering approach in which researchers, healthcare providers, and people with bipolar disorder, work together to advance research and knowledge exchange. Everything we do - from deciding what to research, writing applications for funding, to doing the research and publishing the results, we do hand-in-hand with people with bipolar disorder. We specialize in producing digital health tools to share evidence-informed treatments and self-management strategies, such as our online quality of life assessment tool ([QoL Tool](http://bdqol.com)) and our signature [Bipolar Wellness Centre](http://bdwellness.com).

It just feels like shit is gonna last forever... If something feels great, I also think and kind of expect to last it forever. Mood swings are quite EXTREME - in the morning I am thinking about never going to work again, going back to psychiatry or just end it. Later I am sitting at work like a normal person and feel normal, get a good feedback and think: ""why should I ever quit?""  


I swing from ""depressed as fuck"" to ""life is great"" several times a day... Sometimes it is triggered by events (like conflicts with others, mistakes, shame, boring work) sometimes its just ""I feel shit and dont know why"". According to my therapist I am not manic, and yeah, I can reflect myself, but I often think I can do crazy big projekts alone (I am a designer/filmmaker and have begun multiple very ambitious projects in the past, but didnt finish anything yet and it stresses me out)... Ist like a constant swing between: ""life is BORING and BLEAK as fuck, responsibiulity is crippling and I want to end it all"" and ""I am gonna make important movies and help people and be there for frineds and make the world a better place and this feels awesome...""

However, I have consistently found myself struggling to truly empathize with some of my psychiatric patients, especially those with bipolar.  Part of my personality is a strong drive to control my emotions.  I do not suppress or repress my emotions, but I maintain careful control of exactly how I outwardly express what I am feeling.  Because of this part of me, it is very difficult for me to empathize with those with bipolar disorder; I simply have no frame of reference to understand the inability to control emotion.  I feel that this is a big deficit in my ability to care for my patients.

So, help me: what is it like to have bipolar disorder?  What can I do to help those with bipolar disorder?  How should I go about maintaining a professional relationship with someone with bipolar disorder?

Apologies if any of this demonstrates ignorance or prejudice, my goal is simply to be a better healthcare provider.

People with bipolar disorder experience the mood states of depression and mania (or hypomania). These mood states bring changes in activity, energy levels, and ways of thinking. They can last a few days to several months. Bipolar disorder can cause health problems, and impact relationships, work, and school. But with optimal treatment, care and empowerment, people with bipolar disorder can and do flourish.


[CREST.BD](https://crestbd.ca) approaches bipolar disorder research from a unique perspective. Everything we do–from deciding what to study, conducting research, and publishing our results–we do hand-in-hand with people with bipolar disorder. 


We host Q&As and interviews with bipolar disorder experts all year round through our [talkBD Bipolar Disorder Podcast](https://talkBD.live) - **we hope to stay in touch with you** there.

People with bipolar disorder experience the mood states of depression and mania (or hypomania). These mood states bring changes in activity, energy levels, and ways of thinking. They can last a few days to several months. Bipolar disorder can cause health problems, and impact relationships, work, and school. But with optimal treatment, care and empowerment, people with bipolar disorder can and do flourish.

CREST.BD approaches bipolar disorder research from a unique perspective. Everything we do–from deciding what to study, conducting research, and publishing our results–we do hand-in-hand with people with bipolar disorder. We also produce digital health tools to share science-based treatments and strategies for keeping mentally well.

We host our regular Q&A livestreams with bipolar disorder experts all year round at [www.TalkBD.live](https://www.TalkBD.live) \- we hope to stay in touch with you there. You can also find our updates, social media and events at [linktr.ee/crestbd](https://linktr.ee/crestbd)!

My partner is apparently against psych meds (he himself takes adderall for ADD). He has yelled at me “take more dope, they’re doping you up” and is resentful that I take medication that is keeping me stable. He says my manic episode was just PMS.

When I told him I have bipolar, he said all the right things. Flash forward three months. We hit a very minor rough patch of just not being on the same schedule and not talking enough, and he decided it was “a sign” and ended things. During that conversation, it became clear that not only was he jealous of my late husband, who has been dead for four years, but he hates the fact that I take medication to be stable, and thinks that I am “on pills” because I can’t get over my “ex”.  He made some stupid comment about how he’s trying to live in a medicine-free world, indicating that he thinks I’m like, morally weak for relying on medication. So yeah. I was dumped by an ignorant moron, not because of my bipolar symptoms, but because I am stable, due to medication. I don’t want him back, but man, that smarted.",1686838258,bipolar

- a mental health disorder that’s actually pretty common 
- involves episodes of depression that last for weeks or months and involve feeling low, having little motivation, and suicidal thoughts/attempts 
- also involves episodes of mania that last for weeks/months and involves feelings of excess energy, inflated sense of self, and risky/impulsive decision-making 
- pretty treatable and something that many people live normal lives with after getting the necessary medication/therapy 

Bipolar disorder is NOT: 
- telling your fiancé that they cooked bland chicken and that they shouldn’t shoot nerf guns at a stove that is on  
- sometimes being happy and affectionate with your fiancé and sometimes being annoyed/passive aggressive 
- an “insult” to throw at your partner to invalidate their feelings and avoid any accountability ��",1667785881,bipolar

I felt pretty bad about myself after reading the replies. It was a wake up call. 

 I told my wife I am sorry, and that I read the diagnostic criteria for bipolar and I was 100% wrong. She told me it messed with her pretty bad, and it was irresponsible of me to say it. She also said that it made her feel like all the work she’s done is for nothing. Her therapist did tell her that she’s not bipolar and that I probably didn’t know what it meant.

She was also pretty angry I had spoken to her sister. While we were talking I tried to look at it from her side amd I realized that if the tables were turned I’d feel like she didn’t respect me, and I’d be disappointed in her behavior. It makes me feel like crap that I did that to her. I have some issues about empathy and communication. Among other things. The truth is she’s been bettering herself since the day I met her and I’ve been coasting. I feel a little lost on how to improve myself so I’ve done an email blast to the therapists on my insurance to see if anyone can do zoom sessions. 

I showed the post to her. She said I sound like a “dipshit” but seeing all you people defending her was good. And she was flipping out in a good way that some people recognized she had pmdd from the limited description. She said “the sisterhood knows.” It’s crazy that if someone hadn’t linked the diagnostic criteria and challenged me to read it, I don’t know if I would have.

[Imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/IO7ovat), it's three Instagram stories

mods, feel free to remove this if it is not suited for its own post. however, I feel Kim has made a good statement regarding how the media and public should treat both Kanye and his family during this stressful time for them

**edit:** transcription -

>	[1] As many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand. I've never spoken publicly about how this has affected us at home because I am very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health. But today, I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health.

>	Those that understand mental health or even compulsive behavior know that the family is powerless unless the family member is a minor. People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgmental and not understand that the individual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try.

>	[2] I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions. He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder.

I myself think that bipolar disordered is a useful way to categorize how my brain works and how I behave. But there isn't a point where I my personality ends and bipolar disorder.

Even saying ""you aren't acting like yourself"" to me when I'm manic or depressed is kind of a mischaracterization IMO. I am acting like myself, just not happy/stable.

But what do you think?",1696191760,bipolar

He's lived in town but he's often busy, just got out of a long term relationship this past year, and he's had to move back home. We didn't get around to meeting in person until this year, we drove around town, talked, and went sightseeing. He took me back to his house, and while we were watching a movie together... he kissed me, then we went for food, and we went home. 

After that, a month later, he took me on another date, he sang to me, he went to the park with me, we talked for hours, he helped me with some skills, we went to the park again and... we just kept going, talking for hours, hugging, holding hands. We got dinner, went to a movie spontaneously, and after, he took me to the highest point in town to look at the stars. He told me that night that he liked me.

Thing is, we've both been cautious. He was upfront with me after our first date that ""we need to be careful, since we both have mental health issues"" and after our second he said, while we have a good, very compatible relationship, we can't be formal because we're both bipolar, and that it wouldn't be good for us. I'm trying to understand that, because it's clear he likes me, it's clear he and I have some amount of feelings for each other and he wants to do things in the future with me... but I can't really understand if this is so bad. I do have bipolar, but my case is very mild and treated, I've been on meds for ages since before I was even diagnosed. He's very self aware of his mania, his triggers, the affect it has on him, and he's medicated... That being said, neither of us really knows the full extent of what impact manic episodes might have on his dates with me, and that's something I fear... we talk all the time, but I worry ""what if his manic episodes are the only reason he likes me?""

I'm just trying to gauge this out, because I really like him. I think he likes me? I don't think us both being bipolar is the end of the world, my parents were both bipolar and while they did end up divorcing I really don't think bipolar was the main factor, that being said I know the affect it can have on relationships, my best friend growing up was also bipolar. I know it's not easy, but I care about him even when he has his episodes, I try my best to be there for him, or not if that's what he needs. I really like him, and I think us both having these issues (I also have anxiety, OCD, autism) makes me feel like he understands me, and I understand him more than anyone else I've been with... I don't know what my question is really, I guess I'm just trying to understand? ",1693218015,bipolar

- birth control can interfere with the absorption of drugs like Lamictal (and vice versa) leading to the need for a higher dosage 
- activated charcoal like in hip desserts can inactivate medications of all sorts, and grapefruit can affect absorption as well
- most bipolar medications lead to sensitivity to sun, posing greater risk of sunburn and heat stroke
- BP1 manic episodes can lead to brain damage, which increases over time 
- one of the most common side effects for Lamictal is aphasia and struggling to find words (in my case, sometimes I can find the letter it starts with, or the number or syllables or letters, or a synonym)

Thanks for sharing, I realised that I had no friends that have bipolar so it was interesting.

I did have many friends in my late teens and 20s that had bipolar/schizophrenia/depression in the 80s/90s. It was a wild time, fueled by music, alcohol, drugs and sex. It was our common bond, not necessarily our disorders or mental health (but I think it did help with our understanding of each other). Sadly 4 friends suicided, 2 had bipolar.

However, my wife (social worker) and I have started recently to peace things together and she thinks I might be manic when I'm on keto.

A little background:

I've dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Then I found out about keto when I was 27 (I'm now 35) and I've been hooked ever since. It really changed my life. I always thought that if only the world knew how amazing this feels, everyone would be on it.

My pattern until now, has been: go on keto and for a few months and be so happy, get off for many more months and suffer from anxiety and depression. Rinse and repeat for years. This time, I decided I'm going on keto for life. Especially after this subreddit proved to me that it really can be a lifestyle.

However, recently, I've been experiencing something that I'm starting realize might not be healthy. I get this strong feeling of excitement everyday that I can't explain. My heart just feels like it wants to pop out of my chest. It's too much energy, that I can't control. My mind races with thoughts like crazy and I keep going into these hyper-focus states for hours obsessing  over health, investments, living abroad...etc. to the extent that my work is suffering for it.

Now, when I look back, I'm starting to realize that the 14k motorcycle purchase; borrowing 40k to invest; and obsessing over and spending hundreds of dollars on supplements might not be justified like I thought it was in my mind. And all of these things have only been happening when I'm on keto/fasting. I'm starting to question my judgement, and I'm worried about what I'm gonna get myself into next.

I've been reading about lithium and sodium levels in the blood and how they have an effect on our minds and so I wonder if I'm maybe not including enough lithium in my diet, or maybe too much/too little sodium? But then, how is everyone else is doing it, if this is the case.  I feel as though my problem could be fixed with diet, I just don't know what's the formula. And how much do psychiatrists know about nutrition, anyway?

Am I alone? Can anyone relate?

Who in your life do you tell that you are bipolar? (I think this might be a bit of a generational difference here too.) I work in healthcare and hear the way people talk about bipolar patients all the time I don’t have many Gen-Z coworkers for context most Gen-X, boomers, or millennials and it’s abysmal. (I’m a millennial for context). They talk about us the same way people would talk about people convicted for domestic abuse, or a hit and run or a violent crime. Just disdain. So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they don’t have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they aren’t speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say. 

I’ve noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity. They put it in cover letters that go out to job applications and to me this just seems wildly naïve. I wish we didn’t live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us don’t do those things often or at all. 

People who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the “safer pick” the person who doesn’t specify that or the one who doesn’t have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta Facebook. I appreciate awareness generally but I would caution people about where they are broadcasting what and to whom. Don’t give other people a reason to slam the door on you before they even meet you.

so just out of curiosity and need to relate, has anyone else gotten a similar response? that you’re too nice to have it or that you just don’t seem it, because some people weren’t there when u we’re at ur worst and if you have a very tight grip on yourself you’re at times able to suppress the behavioral symptoms?

I honestly don't know why I post this. Mostly, I thought I should say thank you - I initially found this sub when searching for information about my bipolar diagnosis. But your posts gave me very unexpected clarity about my own life, I relived a very old hurt and finally received an explanation.

&#x200B;

I cried so many times reading posts here. I was where some of you are, I lived through the manic run-off when my mother suddenly decided to leave her marriage. She just left; she was there and then she wasn't, absolutely sudden decision to completely wreck all her life.

Even later, when she was diagnosed, there was no proper explanation or reason why she ended her marriage so suddenly. None of her psychs ever told me, ""That's a common thing,"" about the abrupt manner in which she abandoned her family and children. For years, I thought there was or should have been a reason: maybe she was unhappy with dad, maybe all she later told about her illness was true (although there is no evidence), or maybe I did something wrong. I never connected this to a couple of very naive and impulsive decisions she made and the massive debts she ended up with.

And here I found the exact same story in almost identical circumstances. Reading that so many people are going through this is both painful, heartbreaking and liberating.

&#x200B;

It was heartbreaking to read what is likely my father's perspective.

&#x200B;

I was 6 when she left us (she had two daughters from the first marriage and one child with my father, me), fled town practically overnight leaving father to sort out her lies, debts and care for us all. It took me years to unravel this story, and still some parts remain undisclosed: where she lived for almost a year and what was happening when she was ""terminally ill."" I only know that she disappeared without any clear explanation. When she called us, she spent 30 seconds talking to us and argued with father the rest of the time.

In about a year, she returned for my elder sisters, while I stayed with dad for another year or more. Then they divorced, and she had full custody over me.

&#x200B;

I wish to ask you all who are the nonBP half of the marriage: if you are left with small children on your hands and feel devastated - please, please hold on! You are their only rock and anchor. You are the only stability your children can hope to have because being raised by an unmedicated parent with bipolar 1 is... a lot.

Just imagine all that you probably saw: endlessly calling and texting them when you don't know where they are; trying to find out what hospital they're in; all the sudden irritation (almost hate-like) - and you are 14.

&#x200B;

Please. Don't give up custody.

&#x200B;

Father was a very temperamental man. Her actions broke him enough that he retreated to alcohol as a remedy for pain, I guess. He did some very understandable but not strategically wise things that she later used to drug him through mud, paint him as a violent abuser and get sole custody.

By that point, he couldn't stand being near her, so he sacrificed co-parenting for a chance to avoid ever seeing her again.

I am thankful to you all for a chance to finally see and understand how he felt. There was a time when I was very angry with him, although I can't say was it mirroring of my mother's anger or my own emotion. I had no contact with my father for more than 6 years before I reached out to him in my late teens. It was hard to re-establish the relationship because mother did all in her power to prevent it, and for years, I heard only her side of the story. How he was awful to her, how she was practically forced to leave him, how she loved me, but he (Worst Enemy and The Destructor Of Her Life)...

&#x200B;

I think the reason why I never doubted her version of events until much later on was that I wasn't able to admit or accept that my own mother left me for three years and never as much as asked how I felt. No, all the talks were about her, her illness, her sufferings, her struggles.

&#x200B;

When I decided to at least try talking with dad, my only condition was that we never discussed mom and her actions / their past.

&#x200B;

Now I think it must have been a cruel gesture from me. It seemed like the only solution to keep them both in my life when there was such an acute enmity between them, but now I think it wasn't kind to father. And I wish I could say to him that I am so, so very sorry.

&#x200B;

In the end, we finally rebuilt our relationship anew. He moved in with me after the first heart attack. I fought for his life as I could for another year, and he passed away literally in my arms.

Before his death, I tried to apologize, but he only said I had nothing to apologize for. I hope he meant it and was able to forgive all the times when I echoed her hate and her lies, or my very short calls - I promised to never tell him about her, so he didn't know about her further episodes and must have thought I didn't want him in my life.

&#x200B;

I am still sorry it took me so long to have my father back.

&#x200B;

Please be the rock for your children.

I know you are hurting. I saw how hard it was for dad, but it was equally hard for a child. I am glad father got his life back on track, quit drinking, and we could communicate when I was adult.

&#x200B;

But honestly, when I tried to tell my therapist all that happened in my home from my 10 to 17, it sounded like I made it all up. Like, those things don't happen in real life, they are too dramatic, they are made up for cinematic effect. Real-life teens don't skip school because they fear their mother will commit suicide again. Real teens don't have to spend two days with the corpse of their dog because their mother is somewhere and their sister is in another town, and they're out of money and don't know what to do... I'm so sorry for what dad went through. I was a million times heartbroken when I read your stories, but part of me wishes he could place parenting first, keep the custody and all this wouldn't have happened to me.

&#x200B;

If there's anything in the world that shouldn't happen, it's children dealing with their parents mental illness practically on their own.

&#x200B;

Please, be there for your children. Honestly, I think for us - I mean children of BP parents who very probably carry the genetic component - it's better to be raised in a stable home with one parent than to be put through the bipolar soul-shredder since youth. Because it will take its toll on some of us.

&#x200B;

I am terribly sorry for that you are going through this. 

I don't know if this long vent will make any sense to anyone, but at least I think you'll understand this pain. Good luck everyone and thank you again.

But outside my family, I didn’t experience the stigma around it, however a guy I dated recently was triggered by me when I told him about my diagnosis and said I reminded him of a narcissistic friend who is also bipolar (how on earth can he decide she’s a narcissist when she has a bipolar diagnosis?) and he started crying and everything was too much for him. �

Funny thing he opened up to me about his diagnosis with GAD and social anxiety and I was like okay…. But I didn’t go into some weird reactive state as if he told me he’s a pedophile or a psycopath or something.

**SIL told my Ex with schizophrenia the time and location of my Baby Shower**

(Using a throw away account as I don't want this to easily get back to my ex boyfriend. All names were also changed. TLDR below.) Trigger warning for Schizophrenia, mental health issues

This story needs a lot of background to fully grasp how severe everything is, so buckle in.

My ex boyfriend Jake (27M) and I (27F) broke up a few years ago. We had been together for over five years and were thinking about marriage and buying a house together. In the last year of our relationship everything fell apart. Long story short he had a sudden psychotic episode and was placed in a mental health ward (mental health facility attached to hospital, this is in Australia FYI) for his safety. Following this his entire personality changed and he developed delusions, hallucinations and paranoia which never went away. A large part of his paranoia revolved around me controlling people around him and thinking I was trying to make him look ""crazy."" He also constantly accused me of cheating on him and told me many times that he hated me. He was let out of the hospital after some time and I took responsibility for him.

This change in him was heartbreaking, he was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. I did everything I could to be there for him, I went to all of his mental health appointments and stayed up at night to make sure he didn't leave the house alone (he was prone to wandering out at night when experiencing psychosis). Things became too much for me to handle, he became angry and his paranoia about me made it impossible to help him. He didn't trust me to be close to him but at the same time he didn't want me to leave his sight as he was convinced I was cheating.

When he seemed to be doing a little better mentally I broke up with him, I waited until I felt he would be okay on his own and helped organise for him to move back in with his parents. I was filled with guilt for that decision, but it was the right choice for me. I was struggling. For months I received no love and was used as an emotional punching bag. I did my best, he wasn't the same person anymore and his resentment for me was intense. Obviously this isn't the full break down of his mental health issues as a lot of the things he went through are very personal. I never blamed him for what happened, but I needed to be happy and did what I needed to. It was a messy break up but it went better than expected.

We kept talking for a little while as friends, I think the entire time we kept contact he assumed we would get back together at some point. I continued helping him when I could. When I started a new relationship with my current partner Sam (30M) Jake had a really bad psychotic episode and threatened both of us. He accused me of cheating on him with Sam before we broke up (which makes no sense as I met Sam after we had broken up) and sent both of us intense messages. I managed to contact Jake's family who got him the help he needed. Following this I cut all contact with Jake, it was obvious that we couldn't maintain a friendship anymore.

The only slight connection I have to Jake is my brother's girlfriend Jess (29F). Her and Jake have been friends for years and have maintained their friendship. She knows the entire background to our relationship and never chose sides. I would say I am close with her, we have always been friendly. It always made me happy to know that Jake still had a good friend to confide in.

Shift forward to March 2022. I got pregnant with Sam's baby in January and was three months pregnant. I had just told my family and close friends about the pregnancy. I told everyone to keep it quiet as I didn't feel ready to publicly announce it. I was incredibly emotional, nauseous and in no state to deal with any potential fallout at that point.

Less than 24 hours passed after telling my side of the family and I received a phone call from Jake. He had found out I was pregnant and left a voice mail saying he would be filing for custody of the baby?? Obviously he was in a psychotic episode so I ignored his calls and let his family know that he had reached out to me. By this point it had been over a year since we had even spoken. He has no idea where I live or work so I'm not worried about him showing up physically to confront me.

I knew the only way he could have found out would have been through Jess. I called and confronted her about it and she admitted to it. She was extremely apologetic and said she didn't think it would matter, she thought he would be fine with the news and said he deserved to know. I was upset by this, but I hadn't explicitly told her not to tell Jake so it could have just been a mistake (even though I told her to tell no one I bit my tongue to keep the peace). I forgave her but made it very clear that she shouldn't tell Jake any more information about me or the baby and she agreed it wouldn't ever happen again.

I didn't hear anything from Jake for months.

Last weekend was my baby shower. Sam and I had the baby shower together, it was more of a party than a traditional baby shower. We hired a function room at a bar and invited 80 people to come celebrate. We were all having a great time until I saw Jake standing at the bar, looking around. I managed to slip away without him seeing me and grabbed security to get him escorted out (the area had been roped off for us as a private function so I simply told them he hadn't been invited). I watched as security approached him and asked him to leave, he was furious and started yelling. Demanding to talk to me before he would leave. Sam and several friends went over to him to try and talk him down but it only escalated. He screamed at Sam, claimed that he was the baby's real dad and that we had never really broken up. At this point I left to hide in the ladies room until my mum came to let me know Jake was gone. He had eventually left after a little more screaming. I was mortified and we cut the baby shower short, I couldn't stop crying.

It's now been a few days and I confronted Jess. She is the only person who would have possibly told him the location and time of the baby shower. I wasn't as kind on the phone with her this time. She admitted to telling him and apologised. But said ""how could I keep this a secret from him?."" I was furious and told her that she would no longer receive any news about me or the baby and that I would cut her out of my life. I'm not proud of it but I screamed at her, I couldn't believe how irresponsible she had been. It wasn't her news to share. My brother called me after and asked me to forgive her. He knew she was wrong but he didn't think he should also be punished for what she had done, he knew that by cutting her out I also wouldn't be telling him any news about the baby. In part he thought I should blame Jake for his reaction and not Jess, that she hadn't known he would show up, the damage was already done and I should let it go.

I honestly don't blame Jake for what happened, he is mentally ill and needs help. It's not his fault and I know he will regret all of this when he comes back to a more clear head space. I told his family what had happened and they told me he was readmitted to the mental health ward, he had threatened to harm himself if he wasn't allowed to see my baby. Regardless of whether I think he is at fault, I definitely don't feel safe with Jake now. I have a child to think about and him thinking it is somehow his is pretty scary.

I haven't budged with Jess or my brother. My family all think I should forgive her so my brother can meet his niece/nephew (we don't know the sex). But I just can't trust her. She already broke my trust once and I'm furious. I could have been hurt if Jake had confronted me at the shower. So many things could have gone wrong. I don't know what to do. I'm heart broken that my brother may not get to meet this baby for a while. But I'm scared that she could tell Jake information about the baby that could put us in danger. My parents and other family members have all agreed not to tell Jess or my brother any information about the baby upon threat of also being cut out. I just don't know how long I can feasibly cut them out before I crack. Sam is obviously on my side with all of this, if it wasn't for him I would be in a much worse state.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm finding it hard to stick to my guns on this and worry that news will leak to Jess from other family members. My parents were particularly hesitant to promise not to tell my brother when the baby is born.

TLDR: My sister in law told my ex with schizophrenia the location and time of my baby shower. Even though she has already had one warning and has been told not to tell him anything. My ex somehow thinks the baby is his. I decided to cut SIL out after this event but need advice. How can I keep her cut out when it means pushing my own brother away??

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zbtfsf/update_sil_told_my_ex_with_schizophrenia_the_time/) Posted 4th of December 2022 to r/relationship_advice

**\[UPDATE\] SIL told my Ex with schizophrenia the time and location of my Baby Shower**

After I (27F) made that post I was overwhelmed by the response from everyone. Thank you for all of the amazing advice I received, it definitely put everything into perspective for me and made me take things more seriously. Decided I should post an update as I received a lot of messages asking what had happened.

I received a lot of comments doubting the motives of Jess (29F) and unfortunately you guys were right...

So, I had my baby earlier than anticipated. I'm happy to announce that Sam (30M) and I now have a beautiful son. He is currently 10 weeks old and was born at 38 weeks, we are absolutely smitten with him and couldn't be happier!

Not long after I made my original post Sam and I moved into a new house. We had been living in a one bedroom apartment and decided we needed more space for our growing family. Part of our decision on our house was that it was further away from my brother and Jess. Our apartment had only been a five minute drive from them and I felt uncomfortable knowing that Jake (27M) could potentially be visiting and we could run into him while walking the dog (I also didn't trust that Jess hadn't told him where we lived). Our new house is now a 45 minute drive away from them and I feel much safer, we didn't tell them the location of our new home.

We had been living in our new house for about a month with no issues. I heard from Jake's family that he was on an extended mental health hold at the hospital as his psychotic episode was not subsidising and he refused to take his medication. I also warned them about his relationship with Jess and they seemed to take it seriously, they would keep an eye on them and told the hospital that she was not to be allowed visitation with him. My family stopped pestering me to forgive Jess. My mum had a heart to heart with me and finally understood why I had to cut my brother out. I didn't hear anything from my brother, apparently my mum had stepped up and had a conversation with him about the severity of what Jess had done. It broke my heart to push my brother away as we had been so close. But after reading all of your comments I knew that I had to be responsible and keep my baby safe.

Unfortunately things didn't stay so calm. After a few months I received a call from Jake, he had finally been released from the hospital and was embarrassed about his behaviour at the baby shower. He told me he knew that the baby wasn't his. He cried and asked to speak with Sam, he wanted to personally apologise to him. Sam didn't want to talk to him. I told him I forgave him, I knew it wasn't his fault and that we should move on. I was also very firm with him and told him that under no circumstances would I let him be around me or my baby. If he tried to contact us I wouldn't hesitate to call the police. He accepted that and our conversation ended.

About two weeks later Jake showed up at Sam's workplace, demanding to speak with him. They had a short conversation where Jake broke down in tears and begged to be forgiven. From what Sam told me he didn't seem to be stable, in his apology he said ""I'm so sorry for confronting you in public like that, I should have spoken to you privately. Clearly you didn't know the baby isn't yours and you were humiliated in front of your friends."" (Paraphrasing here). Sam didn't want to provoke him so said he accepted his apology and asked him to leave. Sam then called me to let me know what had happened. I was shattered. Obviously Jess had told him where Sam worked. I called Jake's family to let them know what had happened. They told me the next day he hadn't come home and were extremely worried. He wasn't meant to be driving as his licence had been suspended (he had been caught speeding several times) but he had taken his mum's car without her permission.

A few days later he was found by police in a building that was under construction, completely out of it and confused. He had driven 20 hours away from our town. He was taken to the local hospital and placed in their mental health ward, his family flew up to retrieve him. To this day I still haven't heard any updates on Jake, I assume he is still in a mental health facility. His family always updates me when he is released.

After all of that my brother called me and asked if he could meet up with me for lunch one day. He sounded upset on the phone so I agreed, we met at a McDonald's. Then he told me all the crazy stuff that had happened with Jess. Apparently when Jake got out of the hospital (following the baby shower incident) he had shown up at their house to see Jess. My brother was really worried because he could tell that Jake was in a manic episode. He kept an eye on Jake while he visited and noticed that he was being extremely touchy feely with Jess who started to seem flirty with him as well, it made him really uncomfortable so he made an excuse about him and Jess needing to go to a friend's house. When Jake left him and Jess had a massive fight. He confronted Jess about the flirty behaviour and she was extremely defensive. She flat out denied that she had been flirting or that Jake had been touching her at all. My brother decided to drop it.

Not long after (we later realised this happened on the same day that he had gone to Sam's workplace) Jake showed up at their house again but this time Jess was at work (my brother works from home). Jake told him that he was in love with Jess, confessed that they had been sleeping together and showed him a bunch of text messages between the two of them to prove that he wasn't making this up. My brother asked him to leave. When Jess got home he confronted her, at first she tried to deny it but eventually confessed. She begged my brother to forgive her, she had realised after his outburst at the baby shower that she didn't love him. My brother was furious and told her to stay with her parents for a while. Ever since then he hasn't heard from her, it's been months now and it looks like things are over between the two of them.

My brother feels terrible about what Jess did to me, although I want to let him back into my life fully I still don't trust that he won't eventually get back together with Jess. The two of them haven't officially broken up and until that day comes I won't be sharing my address or photos of our son with him. So far my brother has met our son once at my parents house.

I still don't know why Jess decided to tell Jake about my pregnancy. But I'm so glad she isn't in our lives anymore. I haven't heard anything from her or Jake since, I'm constantly worried he could show up again. I've developed some strange OCD behaviours after it all, needing to check that all our doors are locked five times and touching all of the windows in our house before I can go to sleep. Other than that things have been peaceful so far and Sam and I have been able to enjoy our new life as parents.

[New Update](https://www.reddit.com/user/uncertainomm/comments/13d934h/ex_with_schizophrenia_update/) Posted 9th of May 2023 to  u/uncertainomm

**\[NEW UPDATE\] Ex with Schizophrenia Update**

I saw so many lovely comments on the original post made by another Redditor on my situation on BORU. Figured I may as well give an update as I received a lot of messages. So this is for anyone that may pass through and see this. 

Unfortunately I don't have great news to share in this update. One good thing, my brother did officially break up with Jess. Our relationship is still strained after what happened, but we are able to talk and be civil now. Also my life with Sam and our new baby has been amazing. Being a new parent is definitely hard, but I've been loving every second of it. I haven't gone back to work after my maternity leave, thankfully Sam makes enough that I can be a stay at home mum until I decide I want to go back.

So onto the news with Jake. I didn't hear anything from him or his family for a while, I heard not long after making my last post that he was on a longer term mental health hold and then had radio silence. I took that to be a good thing, not hearing from him usually meant he was doing better.

About a month ago I received a strange text from Jake at 2am. I didn't see it until the morning. The message made no sense, he was talking about seeing someone who came back from the future, that he was being followed and needed to hide. He mentioned the movie director Christopher Nolan and how he had seen hidden messages in his movies and he was going to win a million dollars with numbers that were hidden in his movies. Honestly, I've received similar messages from him before so I wasn't too put off by it. I took a screen shot of the message and sent it to his sister so she knew he had contacted me. Then I kind of forgot about it. His sister didn't get back to me though, which I did find a bit strange. She normally messaged me back pretty quickly.

Two days later his sister called me. She was crying on the phone and asked me if I had received any other contact from Jake that night. I told her no. She explained to me that Jake had passed away from suicide that night. Only hours after he had sent me that message. He had apparently sent the same message to about twenty people in his contact list.

I don't know all of the details but apparently that night he had managed to steal his Mum's car again. She had been hiding her keys from him but after ransacking the house he had found them. He went on a drive around the city, no one really knows the details of what he was thinking. But he rammed into another car and pushed them off the road. They slammed into a tree, thankfully they weren't majorly injured, I later found out it was a young 17 year old couple in the car. It was a hit and run, he apparently sped up behind them on a quiet road hit them from the back and sped off. It was all caught on a dash camera. With the timeline we have it seems he sent his message to everyone only 15 minutes after the accident. About 3 hours later he had passed away. I won't be sharing the details of that.

His funeral happened and I decided not to go. With my complicated relationship with Jake it just didn't feel right to me. One weird thing, Jess went to the funeral. I only know because she took a selfie crying at the funeral and posted it on Instagram with a caption preaching that we need to do more about mental health and supporting people. I was disgusted.

It was incredibly hard to hear what had happened, I'm still processing it all. I feel guilty to admit this, but I also feel a sense of relief that my family doesn't need to be worried anymore. I do miss him though, I think I already grieved him when he changed in our relationship. It's hard to know he is physically gone, I can't even imagine what his family must be feeling. It's difficult for everyone involved. I'm so sad that it came to this, obviously we all hoped he would make a recovery, that one day his psychosis and mania would just disappear completely. He was a good person, just a person that was impacted by mental health problems. I wish there had been a better outcome to all of this.",1684459153,schizophrenia

She was yelling at me, screaming at me, rummaging through my kitchen for food, her kids were running wild in my living room and kitchen trying to mess with my television.

She was cussing at me, telling me I called her a fat B***h and accused me of also calling her a f****t, which those words never came outta my mouth, lmao!!

She then proceeded to go into my room, rummage through my drawers and lay in my bed, looking at me as if I was the intruder.

My hallucination, Kevin (My main hallucination and my husband) showed up a few minutes after she and her kids did. He was yelling at her as well to leave, (this was after I realized she and her kids was not real when he showed up)

**SIL told my Ex with schizophrenia the time and location of my Baby Shower**

(Using a throw away account as I don't want this to easily get back to my ex boyfriend. All names were also changed. TLDR below.)
Trigger warning for Schizophrenia, mental health issues

This story needs a lot of background to fully grasp how severe everything is, so buckle in.

My ex boyfriend Jake (27M) and I (27F) broke up a few years ago. We had been together for over five years and were thinking about marriage and buying a house together. In the last year of our relationship everything fell apart. Long story short he had a sudden psychotic episode and was placed in a mental health ward (mental health facility attached to hospital, this is in Australia FYI) for his safety. Following this his entire personality changed and he developed delusions, hallucinations and paranoia which never went away. A large part of his paranoia revolved around me controlling people around him and thinking I was trying to make him look ""crazy."" He also constantly accused me of cheating on him and told me many times that he hated me. He was let out of the hospital after some time and I took responsibility for him.

This change in him was heartbreaking, he was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. I did everything I could to be there for him, I went to all of his mental health appointments and stayed up at night to make sure he didn't leave the house alone (he was prone to wandering out at night when experiencing psychosis). Things became too much for me to handle, he became angry and his paranoia about me made it impossible to help him. He didn't trust me to be close to him but at the same time he didn't want me to leave his sight as he was convinced I was cheating.

When he seemed to be doing a little better mentally I broke up with him, I waited until I felt he would be okay on his own and helped organise for him to move back in with his parents. I was filled with guilt for that decision, but it was the right choice for me. I was struggling. For months I received no love and was used as an emotional punching bag. I did my best, he wasn't the same person anymore and his resentment for me was intense. Obviously this isn't the full break down of his mental health issues as a lot of the things he went through are very personal. I never blamed him for what happened, but I needed to be happy and did what I needed to. It was a messy break up but it went better than expected.

We kept talking for a little while as friends, I think the entire time we kept contact he assumed we would get back together at some point. I continued helping him when I could. When I started a new relationship with my current partner Sam (30M) Jake had a really bad psychotic episode and threatened both of us. He accused me of cheating on him with Sam before we broke up (which makes no sense as I met Sam after we had broken up) and sent both of us intense messages. I managed to contact Jake's family who got him the help he needed. Following this I cut all contact with Jake, it was obvious that we couldn't maintain a friendship anymore.

The only slight connection I have to Jake is my brother's girlfriend  Jess (29F). Her and Jake have been friends for years and  have maintained their friendship. She knows the entire background to our relationship and never chose sides. I would say I am close with her, we have always been friendly. It always made me happy to know that Jake still had a good friend to confide in.

Shift forward to March 2022. I got pregnant with Sam's baby in January and was three months pregnant. I had just told my family and close friends about the pregnancy. I told everyone to keep it quiet as I didn't feel ready to publicly announce it. I was incredibly emotional, nauseous and in no state to deal with any potential fallout at that point.

Less than 24 hours passed after telling my side of the family and I received a phone call from Jake. He had found out I was pregnant and left a voice mail saying he would be filing for custody of the baby?? Obviously he was in a psychotic episode so I ignored his calls and let his family know that he had reached out to me. By this point it had been over a year since we had even spoken. He has no idea where I live or work so I'm not worried about him showing up physically to confront me.

I knew the only way he could have found out would have been through Jess. I called and confronted her about it and she admitted to it. She was extremely apologetic and said she didn't think it would matter, she thought he would be fine with the news and said he deserved to know. I was upset by this, but I hadn't explicitly told her not to tell Jake so it could have just been a mistake (even though I told her to tell no one I bit my tongue to keep the peace). I forgave her but made it very clear that she shouldn't tell Jake any more information about me or the baby and she agreed it wouldn't ever happen again.

I didn't hear anything from Jake for months.

Last weekend was my baby shower. Sam and I had the baby shower together, it was more of a party than a traditional baby shower. We hired a function room at a bar and invited 80 people to come celebrate. We were all having a great time until I saw Jake standing at the bar, looking around. I managed to slip away without him seeing me and grabbed security to get him escorted out (the area had been roped off for us as a private function so I simply told them he hadn't been invited). I watched as security approached him and asked him to leave, he was furious and started yelling. Demanding to talk to me before he would leave. Sam and several friends went over to him to try and talk him down but it only escalated. He screamed at Sam, claimed that he was the baby's real dad and that we had never really broken up. At this point I left to hide in the ladies room until my mum came to let me know Jake was gone. He had eventually left after a little more screaming. I was mortified and we cut the baby shower short, I couldn't stop crying.

It's now been a few days and I confronted Jess. She is the only person who would have possibly told him the location and time of the baby shower. I wasn't as kind on the phone with her this time. She admitted to telling him and apologised. But said ""how could I keep this a secret from him?.""  I was furious and told her that she would no longer receive any news about me or the baby and that I would cut her out of my life. I'm not proud of it but I screamed at her, I couldn't believe how irresponsible she had been. It wasn't her news to share. My brother called me after and asked me to forgive her. He knew she was wrong but he didn't think he should also be punished for what she had done, he knew that by cutting her out I also wouldn't be telling him any news about the baby. In part he thought I should blame Jake for his reaction and not Jess, that she hadn't known he would show up, the damage was already done and I should let it go.

I honestly don't blame Jake for what happened, he is mentally ill and needs help. It's not his fault and I know he will regret all of this when he comes back to a more clear head space. I told his family what had happened and they told me he was readmitted to the mental health ward, he had threatened to harm himself if he wasn't allowed to see my baby. Regardless of whether I think he is at fault, I definitely don't feel safe with Jake now. I have a child to think about and him thinking it is somehow his is pretty scary.

I haven't budged with Jess or my brother. My family all think I should forgive her so my brother can meet his niece/nephew (we don't know the sex). But I just can't trust her. She already broke my trust once and I'm furious. I could have been hurt if Jake had confronted me at the shower. So many things could have gone wrong. I don't know what to do. I'm heart broken that my brother may not get to meet this baby for a while. But I'm scared that she could tell Jake information about the baby that could put us in danger. My parents and other family members have all agreed not to tell Jess or my brother any information about the baby upon threat of also being cut out. I just don't know how long I can feasibly cut them out before I crack. Sam is obviously on my side with all of this, if it wasn't for him I would be in a much worse state.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm finding it hard to stick to my guns on this and worry that news will leak to Jess from other family members. My parents were particularly hesitant to promise not to tell my brother when the baby is born. 

TLDR: My sister in law told my ex with schizophrenia the location and time of my baby shower. Even though she has already had one warning and has been told not to tell him anything. My ex somehow thinks the baby is his. I decided to cut SIL out after this event but need advice. How can I keep her cut out when it means pushing my own brother away??

**[UPDATE] SIL told my Ex with schizophrenia the time and location of my Baby Shower**


If you would like to read the original post it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wb10ij/sil_told_my_ex_with_schizophrenia_the_time_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  but was removed, you can read it as a pinned comment on the post though. 



After I (27F) made that post I was overwhelmed by the response from everyone. Thank you for all of the amazing advice I received, it definitely put everything into perspective for me and made me take things more seriously. Decided I should post an update as I received a lot of messages asking what had happened. 


I received a lot of comments doubting the motives of Jess (29F) and unfortunately you guys were right...



So, I had my baby earlier than anticipated. I'm happy to announce that Sam (30M) and I now have a beautiful son. He is currently 10 weeks old and was born at 38 weeks, we are absolutely smitten with him and couldn't be happier!



Not long after I made my original post Sam and I moved into a new house. We had been living in a one bedroom apartment and decided we needed more space for our growing family. Part of our decision on our house was that it was further away from my brother  and Jess. Our apartment had only been a five minute drive from them and I felt uncomfortable knowing that Jake (27M) could potentially be visiting and we could run into him while walking the dog (I also didn't trust that Jess hadn't told him where we lived). Our new house is now a 45 minute drive away from them and I feel much safer, we didn't tell them the location of our new home.



We had been living in our new house for about a month with no issues. I heard from Jake's family that he was on an extended mental health hold at the hospital as his psychotic episode was not subsidising and he refused to take his medication. I also warned them about his relationship with Jess and they seemed to take it seriously, they would keep an eye on them and told the hospital that she was not to be allowed visitation with him.
My family stopped pestering me to forgive Jess. My mum had a heart to heart with me and finally understood why I had to cut my brother out. I didn't hear anything from my brother, apparently my mum had stepped up and had a conversation with him about the severity of what Jess had done. It broke my heart to push my brother away as we had been so close. But after reading all of your comments I knew that I had to be responsible and keep my baby safe.



Unfortunately things didn't stay so calm. After a few months I received a call from Jake, he had finally been released from the hospital and was embarrassed about his behaviour at the baby shower. He told me he knew that the baby wasn't his. He cried and asked to speak with Sam, he wanted to personally apologise to him. Sam didn't want to talk to him. I told him I forgave him, I knew it wasn't his fault and that we should move on. I was also very firm with him and told him that under no circumstances would I let him be around me or my baby. If he tried to contact us I wouldn't hesitate to call the police. He accepted that and our conversation ended.



About two weeks later Jake showed up at Sam's workplace, demanding to speak with him. They had a short conversation where Jake broke down in tears and begged to be forgiven. From what Sam told me he didn't seem to be stable, in his apology he said ""I'm so sorry for confronting you in public like that, I should have spoken to you privately. Clearly you didn't know the baby isn't yours and you were humiliated in front of your friends."" (Paraphrasing here). Sam didn't want to provoke him so said he accepted his apology and asked him to leave. Sam then called me to let me know what had happened. I was shattered. Obviously Jess had told him where Sam worked. I called Jake's family to let them know what had happened. They told me the next day he hadn't come home and were extremely worried. He wasn't meant to be driving as his licence had been suspended (he had been caught speeding several times) but he had taken his mum's car without her permission. 



A few days later he was found by police in a building that was under construction, completely out of it and confused. He had driven 20 hours away from our town. He was taken to the local hospital and placed in their mental health ward, his family flew up to retrieve him. To this day I still haven't heard any updates on Jake, I assume he is still in a mental health facility. His family always updates me when he is released.



After all of that my brother called me and asked if he could meet up with me for lunch one day. He sounded upset on the phone so I agreed, we met at a McDonald's. Then he told me all the crazy stuff that had happened with Jess. Apparently when Jake got out of the hospital (following the baby shower incident) he had shown up at their house to see Jess. My brother was really worried because he could tell that Jake was in a manic episode. He kept an eye on Jake while he visited and noticed that he was being extremely touchy feely with Jess who started to seem flirty with him as well, it made him really uncomfortable so he made an excuse about him and Jess needing to go to a friend's house. When Jake left him and Jess had a massive fight. He confronted Jess about the flirty behaviour and she was extremely defensive. She flat out denied that she had been flirting or that Jake had been touching her at all. My brother decided to drop it.



Not long after (we later realised this happened on the same day that he had gone to Sam's workplace) Jake showed up at their house again but this time Jess was at work (my brother works from home). Jake told him that he was in love with Jess, confessed that they had been sleeping together and showed him a bunch of text messages between the two of them to prove that he wasn't making this up. My brother asked him to leave. When Jess got home he confronted her, at first she tried to deny it but eventually confessed. She begged my brother to forgive her, she had realised after his outburst at the baby shower that she didn't love him. My brother was furious and told her to stay with her parents for a while. Ever since then he hasn't heard from her, it's been months now and it looks like things are over between the two of them.



My brother feels terrible about what Jess did to me, although I want to let him back into my life fully I still don't trust that he won't eventually get back together with Jess. The two of them haven't officially broken up and until that day comes I won't be sharing my address or photos of our son with him. So far my brother has met our son once at my parents house. 



I still don't know why Jess decided to tell Jake about my pregnancy. But I'm so glad she isn't in our lives anymore. I haven't heard anything from her or Jake since, I'm constantly worried he could show up again. I've developed some strange OCD behaviours after it all, needing to check that all our doors are locked five times and touching all of the windows in our house before I can go to sleep. Other than that things have been peaceful so far and Sam and I have been able to enjoy our new life as parents.



(TLDR: My ex and my SIL were having an affair. My ex still thinks that my baby is his. My brother and SIL no longer live together but haven't fully broken up yet)",1670744008,schizophrenia

One type of delusion found with this disorder is the delusion of grandeur - where one thinks they have some extra supernatural relationship with god/
are god/think they're famous etc.
Schizophrenia is hereditary and thus likely passed down to Isaac which might be why he was so willing to give his life. Another explanation I have for Isaac’s willingness to give his life is due to Folie à deux (‘folly of two’ phenomenon), when a specific delusion is shared by people in close relationships.

But there’s nothing wrong with having schizophrenia - just like there’s nothing wrong with having depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety, OCD, personality disorders, etc. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.

Lottie isn’t “the big bad”. Whether you’re a Lottie fan or not - we can all admit that Lottie hasn’t done anything more harmful than other characters. In fact, she has done more to repent and try to correct her wrongs for the purpose of helping others in the way she knows best how to help (whether her way is abnormal or healthy or not). In the teen timeline she hasn’t forced anyone to follow her. The people who choose to rely on her have autonomy (except for maybe Tai, who admittedly just joined because Van wanted her to). In the adult timeline, she’s the only one who actively sought/seeks treatment for her mental wellness. The other main characters could actually take a note or two when it comes to acknowledging their problems (and Nat seemingly does). Sure, running a cult is sketchy as hell. And encouraging her followers to get off their meds while being medicated herself is dishonest. But so far that hasn’t seemed to kill or critically injure anyone, or put children in danger like the other survivors have HELLA done while still being the “heroes” of this story. Lottie is mostly guilty of having misguided well intentions without full consideration of potential consequences - a problem, yes. But not anything more awful than we have seen other characters do.

People living with schizophrenia aren’t evil. They can function with the right treatment. And schizophrenia should not be used or viewed as insulting or derogatory. It should be normalized. 

It’s okay and understandable to be offended by people who INSULT Lottie for having schizophrenia. It’s not okay to be offended that Lottie may have or does have *high functioning* schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is not a character flaw. The struggles and stigmatization that people with schizophrenia go through need honest representation. 

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I use the term hero as a synonym for “protagonist” in this post title. Lottie is one of the protagonists, as opposed to her being the antagonist of the greater YJ story.

UPDATE: You guys, this post is not the condemnation or demonization of other characters or any mental health disorders they may have. This post is about normalizing schizophrenia. Trauma, depression, and substance use disorders (while still very much stigmatized) are more widely accepted than people with schizophrenia. The same argument can be made about dissociative identity disorder (often mis-termed “multiple personalities”). The reason this post doesn’t make that specific argument is because Lottie’s character is presumed to have schizophrenia or a similar illness, not DID. A whole other post could be made in defense of Taissa. An argument can be made in defense of all of the characters. They are ALL on level playing field. What is happening to each of them is normal and natural (besides cults, murder, elderly abuse, or politicians that don’t cannibalize tax dollars). Lottie is not above or below any of them. Stop this miscontextualizing. Stop the unnecessary hate. And yes the demonization of Lottie & her schizophrenia has been happening whether you have experienced it, see it, done it or not. That’s not even worth arguing about.

CONSIDER HOW WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A FICTIONAL TV SHOW AND HOW YOU SAY IT MAY AFFECT AND PERPETUATE A STRUGGLE FOR **REAL-LIFE** VULNERABLE PEOPLE.

I am schizophrenic. There is a general stereotype about people with my illness, many people think we hear voices telling us to kill, and they assume we are always in a state of psychosis, but that is not true at all! So, here is a general run-down of what I go through personally.

The voice I hear is that of a young male named Kevin, who is in his early twenties. The voice I hear most often is dedicated to making me happy and encouraging me in a positive way. In the aftermath of mental breakdowns or schizophrenic episodes, he loves to comfort me when I am upset or crying. Every day, he gives me advice on what I should do, how I should dress, and just all around makes me comfortable and happy.

Throughout the years, my auditory voice Kevin has told me the following things. He tells me he is my son, that we are married and that we have two children. In his explanation, he said that we do family vacations together with our children and own our own businesses. His profession is architect, and I am a furniture designer. He told me he suffers from extreme anxiety, but that's all.

My schizophrenia has kept him at the center of my life for nearly seven years. Besides this, he is extremely sensitive and cries constantly; he talks about me to the other voices and how much he loves and adores me. He protects me from the demonic hallucinations I have, and immediately comes to my aid to make sure they don't harm me.

I've never dated anyone else besides one person on and off for six years when my schizophrenia was first showing signs. And I've never been sexually intimate with a real person because I'd feel like I'm cheating on him. I also for that same reason refuse to date anymore, I don't wanna break his heart. My family asks me why I'm single and even tries to tell me I need to get out and socialize, to find someone romantically. But they just don't understand. �",1664221942,schizophrenia

2375,"My nanny got hospitalized w/ schizophrenia, what do I do w/her employment?",741,1678f9h,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1678f9h/my_nanny_got_hospitalized_w_schizophrenia_what_do/,311,"Long story short, I hired a wonderful nanny in her fifties earlier this year when I had another baby. Since then she has been my saving grace and helped me with taking care of the kids and general housechores. She has jumped at the chance at the extended hours I have offered, even commuting an hour each way to help us. I have noticed that she has struggled with anxiety and other health problems since she started with us. For example she sleeps very poorly at night, never eats, barely drinks or uses the restroom when she is working for us, starts to shed some tears if my toddler cries intensely, and becomes avoidant and anxious when my toddler throws a tantrum. I have brought up my observations with her several times.

Today I was quite shocked when someone in her family called me and told me she was hospitalized with schizofrenia and won’t be able to work for a while. 
Apparently, she is not doing too well. She is quite spaced out, doesn’t know where she is and has paranoia (believes she is being followed) etc. They claim this is the first episode but I am not so sure due to some of the signs I am now seeing click in place - and I have reason now to think she might have witheld her diagnosis during the interview.

Am I correct to assume that finding the correct medication to become stable is a very lengthy process and there are no guarantees that she will take them?
I have very young children and I would now be very concerned about leaving them with her without me being present. I am scared she will have another episode and not be able to care for them and them getting hurt. I say this as I have a family member with the same condition and it is very scary when he has an episode. For example, during an episode an aggressive new person emerges with a demon voice and he says «bad things gonna happen if you don’t get way from me» and then him going into a state where he undresses and cannot hear or communicate with anyone.

I feel now that beingpresent constantly kills the point of having a nanny as I need to be able to go out of the house and go back to work at some point.

What should I do going forward. Should I employ a temp for now and talk to her directly when she is recovered enough? What if I find out she has witheld her diagnosis and not taken her medication? If I let this person go, how should I go about it? My daughter is very bonded with her. Should I let them have a parting meeting?
Should I give her a sizable parting check? 
Sorry for all the questions. I have some many thoughts at the moment and I am hoping for some new viewpoints and advice.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit:

Thank you all so so much for all of your advice. I am truly humbled that so many people have taken their time and given me such good advice and insight.
I have learned a lot from reading all your responses and I feel the way forward is now clear. 

Assuming the diagnosis is correct:
I agree that my nanny is in a very vulnerable position and will need a lot of professional help going forward. She is in no position to take care of vulnerable children, now or in the future. Doing so would be rolling the dice and I am not willing to take any risks with my children.

As many of you pointed out, due to her age, it is unlikely (although not impossible) this is her first mental episode. Whether she is unaware of that or if she has been withholding the information, remains unclear until I speak with her myself. I will keep an open mind that there may be other medical possibilities that has resulted in her hospitalization and schizophrenic symptoms, but I am afraid it might be wishful thinking on my part. 

Going forward, I will start looking for a new nanny as I am in need of an immediate replacement. When my nanny finally does contacts me, I will schedule a meeting in public place with her - plus her and my husband. My husband and I will bring with us some art work from my toddler, a thank you letter and a severance check - and essentially we will see how things play-out during the meeting. 

For all I know she might quit on her own accord as she is normally a very empathetic, non confrontational, sweet and understanding person. However, as someone mentioned here, I do not know how she is when she is out of sorts. 
For example my family member who I mentioned in my post that has the condition is completely different now than he was before he got ill. Now, generally he has very disorganized, irrational thoughts. Sometimes he suffers from memory loss.

Therefore, by meeting her, I can thank her in person for her good service but also see if she is suffering from confusion, memory loss/ blackouts that can possibly result in her showing up unannounced at my door or my toddler’s kindergarten in the future. 

As far as the legal aspect, thank you for the heads up. I will bear it in mind, although,I do not think it will be a problem due to the way things work in my country.
Again, thank you all so much for your advice and support. I was really positively surprised!
Have a blessed day!",1693577893,schizophrenia

Things like:

Hallucinations or Visions

Voices in your head

Imaginary friends

Paranoia

Everyone thinks your crazy

Then if it turned out the character actually wasn’t crazy would be a plus. Urban Fantasy would be another plus.

An example that I love would be Dalinar from Stormlight Archive. That was handled really well for a fantasy setting.

Thanks for any help!

I’ve noticed these changes and at first it wasn’t to serious. but it has gotten worse. last night I had the worst episode I’ve had so far. I was just sitting on my floor, but when I tried to get up I couldn’t. I had no control over my body. I looked down to see these weird geometric shapes in the carpet that started moving up my legs and holding me to the floor. now at this moment I was freaking out I was breathing heavy but there was nothing I could do. I sat watching the carpet move under me for about 20 minutes it felt like. but I was able to move my eyes and looked underneath my bed and saw some creature moving towards me, crawling out from under my bed. and that gave me enough adrenaline to get up. then I was just looking around my room scared and crying at this point. Now I’ve seen and heard things before, but noting this terrifying. Now I was crying cause I didn’t feel safe in my room. So I left slowly making my way up the stairs to the kitchen cause I didn’t want to be in my room if that thing got out from under my bed. I thought it was over but when I got into the kitchen there were faces watching me through the window. I got scared but my eyes guardian Angel assured me they couldn’t get in. She helped me to feel a bit safer. I then grabbed a bun with nothing on it and slowly dragged my feet down the stairs to my room ignoring the faces outside my house calling my name. And I sat in my bed eating my bun. At this point I was crying uncontrollably and I was scared. I then was able to distract myself with a video and later went to sleep ignoring anything I was seeing wether it might’ve been real or not. I’ve also had experiences before of hearing voices, or having thoughts that are later confirmed to be untrue or nonsensical, and even seeing things. but usually it’s not to scary like this time. And I haven’t told anyone about this cause last time I said something they told me I was weird and just making it up. So I don’t know what to do. I don’t want people to think I’m crazy cause I am completely normal. And I do sports and can’t have this getting in the way.",1697400637,schizophrenia

There are poltergeists without bodies among us in lower dimensions and may come across as dark shadow blobs smelling like smoke that many schizophrenic people see changing over time, **you will hear people talk about it in the comments** and there are aliens or hybrids with a body, operating in higher dimensions. **They are not space aliens** but hybrids or mutants vessels created straight from earth.   
The reptilian aliens originated from Velociraptor DNA running a hybridization program to become humanoid and walk among us to influence society. This also goes for gray aliens which originate from a giant praying mantis which people also see during DMT drug use. 

&#x200B;

[The hybridization program.](https://preview.redd.it/seda1al7irkb1.jpg?width=2217&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68ffb2db008b69d30a6ed8719c938b3b79e015d4)

In regards to poltergeists, this makes up for there being different type of alien abductions and sightings. Sleep paralysis are done by invisible shadow blobs or figures, out of body abductions are done by an (**astral body**) orb. Physical abductions are done by either a craft or object of light, also related to the (**Body of Light**) which is a state of dematerializing into photon particles. I'll post wiki links in the comments about this. 

Here are few different body type techniques aliens use, almost nobody knows this yet: **This is related to real paranormal sightings we are having.**

[Bright UFO orbs: This is a Body of light used for physical transport abductions, it's basically dematerializing into biophoton particles into an energyfield to travel in higher realms, planes or what we call Dimensions. ](https://preview.redd.it/nrpeolbfgrkb1.jpg?width=514&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21376a33f7363a95d1b4c0ea724d5729e0499458)

Having said this, this is why aliens or hybrids are related to poltergeist activity, they use black magic powers or techniques like magicians and mentalists. They can read your minds, predict movements you make or simply control you in any direction they want through calculations and matrix codes, it's  a form of subliminal hypnosis. 

The only evidence for human hybrids walking among us at the moment are paranormal videos like cryptids, people having mental illnesses, or having alter egos. They are trying to run our lives like it's a game, there are several movies hinting to this.   
Here are a few movies related to real mental health cases and controlled possessions mostly related to **Gangstalking**:

**They Live** (aliens live inside of us)  
**The Truman show** (as the actors running the simulation, causing planned and staged events)  
**The Box** (using humans as a proxy, watching you through the eyes of others)  
**The Game** (playing with us)  
**Eyes Wide Shut** (mind controlling the elites, giving them alter egos or engaging into perverted acts.)

The message of this post and the answer of these movies are, invisible aliens or apparitions are possessing people from an unseen dimension, they also can give people nightmares, hallucinations, alter people's perception or give people alter ego's.   
I'm not interested in promoting my sub **/Alienhybridsabuse** but I collect there all my research and evidence also hoping experiencers will share their testimonies there for researching purposes. I managed to link elites abusing children to alter ego's and possessions.

I have schizophrenia,  and no it's not self diagnosed I have hospitalized, not taken my pills so I've  been on Risperdal consta 50mg  or something like that, the injection for about 8 years now every two weeks. I'm honestly feeling defeated and I don't know what to do. I've been to the crc, I was on a program that was a group session with all people who had similar issues but they moved the issues to not a close schizophrenia group but to anyone with anxiety and depression and I honestly lost my will to go to these meetings after the 30th person said they had anxiety (it is an issue but it was purely a schizophrenia help group before that) and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I've been drinking heavily the last week playing star trek online and I'm honestly lost. 

If anyone could recommend a good support group for schizophrenia I would be eternally grateful.

If not I really need people to tell me what to do. I drank over 90 ounces the last 4 days and I literally feel me wasting away. I just want a proper group that is about my problems not everyone with.... I really don't know. I think I was with a group with the manitoba schizophrenia society but I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist anymore.

I just don't want to waste away I want to look for help but every resource I had generalized. 5 years ago I could get the help I wanted but now I don't know., im extremely sorry about the rambling.

Tl;DR: I need mental help, and I don't know where to go, I felt included before but no more.

Edit: I should have also mentioned my doctor Dr. Ghalib left the country years ago and have yet to get another psyche doctor other than my family doctor simply because there is none. I was only assign to doctor ghalib after I was forced into floor 5 at seven oaks when there was one years ago. Haven't been in a hospital since but I honestly feel me heading there and I don't want to.

At multiple occasions I asked my friends if they heard the voice too. I was always the only one that heard it . It went on for so long that i thought it was either a very elaborate joke by my friends , or that i might seriously have some mental issues.   


&#x200B;

Turns out that when you disable the non-essential voice-lines for the operators in Valorant , they don't actually mute them , but rather play them at a very low volume and in a weird compressed/echoey/mono way (much like if you accidentally catch radio signals on stuff).

When I say Schizophrenic Spectrum, you probably think of the stereotypes. A broken artist, or a madman babbling to themselves. It’s important in understanding where I’m coming from to know that these are Hollywood stereotypes, not often based in reality. How Schizophrenia can often appear, based as a formally diagnosed individual, is a quiet person, struggling to partake in the world around them, but not violent or cruel. Maybe unaware of how they come across, spending long hours staring into the distance, unaware of the time they’re losing. We tend to have a rich experience in our mind, hence why we might not notice how much we’re missing out on; We get the needed stimulation in our minds from visions and “loud thoughts” (how internal voices are. This is not external hallucinations, which sound like someone is in the room). This is more of how a loss of reality can sometimes look.

I can see so much of my own behavior in this character, hence why I personally headcanon him as an excellent accidental Schizophrenia portrayal. If you have any questions on my take on this, feel free to ask.",1686018922,schizophrenia

The man, as he described him, was very shady. He said it seemed the man had a darkness about him even though it was sunny out. Very tall with bad teeth. 

He asked my uncle to put his hand out and put a weird looking coin in it. He said it seemed like a very old coin. The man told him ""As long as you hold onto this coin good luck will always be yours. But if you lose it or throw it away terrible things will happen to you and your life will fall apart.""

My uncle though it was very weird but said thank you then went into the gas station and bought a soda and a dollar scratch ticket. He won $250 dollars on the scratch ticket. He was freaked out at this point. He came back outside and the man that had given him the coin was nowhere to be found. 

My uncle walked down the road a ways and, always being a religious person, threw the coin into the swamp and kept walking as fast as he could trying to get a ride home back to west Virginia because he was so scared in that moment.

Last year, our house flooded during a storm and it's still taking time to get everything repaired. My children and I are staying with my brother until we can return back home. It's been an adjustment for everybody but we're managing. 

My younger daughter has her moments but she was really too little to remember any of the actual flooding. My son was pretty anxious in storms for a few months but has gotten over it as he realizes that what happened to us is relatively rare for the area. Initially, my older daughter was doing okay but now that it's around the year-anniversary she's gotten a lot more worried. 

The thing about my daughter is that, unlike her siblings, she's been afraid of thunderstorms her entire life, and it was actually kind of odd how not-afraid she's been for this past year. I thought she had just aged out of the fear. Now that it's returned, I figured that last year must have been a fluke and she's gotten back to being her normal self. So, when my daughter came to me a few nights ago stating that she thinks that she has PTSD, I started laughing. I wasn't laughing at her, I was laughing because it's absurd. None of us have PTSD and I can say as her mother that her current fear levels are not a product of any PTSD, but simply a return to her pre-flooding fear of thunderstorms. 

However, ever since our conversation, my daughter's refused to talk to me. I confronted her about her rudeness and told her that, though I understand that she's afraid of thunderstorms and has been forever, she doesn't really have PTSD. She'll age out of her fear in time, and I think she can get over most of it when we can go back home. She told me that I'm mean and don't listen to her. I don't think I'm terribly mean but my brother told me that I could have been nicer, so I figured that I would ask, AITA?",1673119900,PTSD

I listened to a lot of people from this subreddit.

I had to calm the fuck down, this was that hardest. I felt like a fucking failure to my family for getting my benefits reduced.

I had to find a way to fight back. That part was actually simple. I had a mental health provider do a DBQ and give their opinin.

In between my post and now I received another letterthat with PTSD they do not do such a dramatic drop sothey would only be dropping me to 50% and I will be reevaluated in the future. That brought some piece and made me feel less of a failure.

I wrote a statement of how PTSD interfears with my normal life. I would recommend not lying, but use a stronger statement than, ""I don't like it when loud noises happen, it makes me want to stay inside"" paint a beautiful word picture that illustrates your struggle.

Then I simply filed a secondary to their proposed reduction to drop me from 70% to 50%.

At this point it was out of my hands I fought and whatever happens happens.

As of June 30th the VA will not be touching the 70% and *rescinded the 50% drop""

My final thoughts, this was definitely a mental mind fuck but the other veterans here had my back. When they say every time you make a claim it opens up your other claims to be re-evaluated, believe it. I opened a claim for migraines and they choose to re-evaluate my ptsd as well.

2499,Do people actually know what having PTSD is like?,1789,aq77ky,RWBY,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/aq77ky/do_people_actually_know_what_having_ptsd_is_like/,180,"I've seen a lot of people say Yang's PTSD arc was poorly handled and that it should have had more weight in the Adam vs. Yang & Blake fight. While I have no comment on the entire arc as a whole, I think it was handled well in the battle vs Adam.

I feel like a lot of people are under the impression that PTSD causes people to break down at the sight of whatever caused it.

As someone who has suffered from it, let me tell you: it's the literal exact opposite.

PTSD happens when you go through a traumatic event, and your brain decides that it never wants to be fucked up in that way ever again, so it will go to extreme measures to pump you full of adrenaline so you're ready whenever the same traumatic event happens again. If it ever does. I used to go into fight or flight mode whenever someone did something like ripping a piece of paper out of their notebook. The tiniest sounds set me off, and it was all because my brain assumed that the sound was the source of my PTSD (it wasn't) and decided to prepare appropriately for the situation.

So when you actually face the source of your stressor, the PTSD kicks in, not to render you useless and immobile, but *to give you more adrenaline so you don't have a repeat of whatever happened the first time*.

In that sense when I watched the entire fight I thought Yang's actions were all perfectly reasonable. She's fresh and undamaged, compared to Adam and Blake who fought for a long time and got thrown off a really tall radio tower (AND Adam got slammed in the face with a motorcycle). She was probably so pumped full of adrenaline that she had no time to actually think about the fact that she was facing the guy who cut off her arm, because THAT'S what PTSD does to you. It's a survival mechanism. Her PTSD didn't make her think ""oh god I'm screwed this guy cut off my arm and he's gonna do it again."" It makes her think ""okay, this guy cut off my arm, so now we're gonna do whatever we fucking can to make sure he doesn't do it again cause that shit sucked.""

Also, I don't even mean this next part in a shippy way. Yang clearly cares for Blake a lot, whether it be romantic or platonic is up to you, I'm not here to argue that. But no matter what, you have to admit that she cares A LOT about Blake, and the reason why she ended up sucked into the fight wasn't, for the most part, for revenge. Yes it was a part of it, but the main motivator is her desire to make sure Adam doesn't, you know, straight up murder Blake.

Like, yeah the thought of what caused my PTSD will give me nightmares, but if I'm faced with it again and one of my best friends was in direct danger from it, you can bet your ass I'm gonna forget all about myself and do everything I can to get them out of the situation. Just saying.

And when Adam actually starts preying on her fears, near the tail end of the battle when he's grasping for whatever tactics he can and he tries to scare Yang by saying ""Do you think you were faster than you were at Beacon?"" like, it actually *works.* You can tell she is shaken up from it, because when Adam starts attacking her after that she stops attacking back. All she does is dodge and flail around, and Adam gets a few good hits on her when he previously didn't. Go and rewatch the fight if you need to, because that's what happens.

So overall I didn't see any problems with the way they handled Yang's PTSD, at least in this final battle. In fact I thought it was handled better than expected. I'm not here to say anything about anything else. I just wanted to let you guys know that I personally saw it as realistic, because I've been through it, and it was very, very relatable.

Sorry if I'm beating a dead horse here. It just seemed like people either didn't actually know what having PTSD is like, or that they had a warped view of it. So. Yeah. That's all I got. If any of this didn't make any sense just tell me, I'd be happy to try and clarify. I don't want to start a fight. c:",1550068684,PTSD

Lack of contact with other neurodivergent individuals is equivalent to living life on an alien planet for a young undiagnosed child.

I’ve been diagnosed for over half a year and I haven’t even peeled back the first layer of the onion yet. I keep having “eureka” moments where the dots starting connecting a bit more and more.

All those thoughts, feelings, and actions I suppressed to “fit in”. I always tried but was just the “smart, weird kid”. I was constantly analyzing behavior and wondering what I did wrong. I got used to saying sorry even if something wasn’t my fault.

I ignored my sensory issues so much I disassociated. Imagine how that affects any autistic child without neurodivergent peers to talk to. Thoughts of “Am I normal? What’s happening to me? I must be crazy!” are the reality for us.

It’s no wonder so many autistic adults grow up with constant anxiety and depression. But that is all the more reason we need to be kind to ourselves. I hope everyone reading this has a wonderful day. Hugs for everyone.",1693839934,PTSD

When it comes to these IPs, people love tragic stories and get so attached to them, even obsessed with them and then I look up as a survivor, it’s like I can’t build a support system worth a damn. 

Don’t even get me started on Batman and his intense childhood trauma that made him into the Batman, but let’s talk Harley Quinn, quintessential domestic violence survivor.

My abuser dropped the Harley Quinn series when he realized it was about Harley Quinn leaving the Joker and becoming her own person. What a loser.

Iron-Man is the most perfect example for PTSD.

Even Obi-Wan Kenobi (Star Wars), Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games), every final girl ever, John Wick and his dog, the list goes on and on.

More recent IPs that are trending include the Last of Us, a series full of complex trauma. I feel like Neil understands trauma so well. I love it so much.

The entertainment industry would be nothing without trauma.

It’s abhorrent when trauma survivors desire support and space that we end up alienated because we’re asking for too much yet everyone loves a fictional trauma survivor.

Everyone loves a tragic backstory, but survivors are accused of trauma dumping or playing the victim for just experiencing hard things in life.

Everyone loves a hero, but the minute you protect someone else from trauma, you’re discarded and shunned.

Yeah, I guess fiction doesn’t always match reality, but art imitates life.

It’s sick to think that the only time people have space for traumatized people is when they don’t even exist, but I’m not surprised.

Anyway, who is your favorite fictional trauma survivor? And why?

Edit: 

My favorite traumatized characters are Ellie and Abby from the Last of Us franchise. I feel so seen.

That well over half of the symptoms overlap and there’s only a few key differences to separate the two at all?  I know the stigma on all personality disorders (and all mental health issues really) is generally negative, but I’m not sure why pwBPD get so much damn sympathy and pwNPD get absolutely none.  Somehow, even though the two are strikingly similar, BPD is seen as something that should be accepted and accommodated, while NPD is something that should be “cured” (aka smothered out/eliminated).  I’m not saying that either of these approaches is the right one.  First of all, treat us all the same.  Give us all your sympathy or give us all nothing, but don’t pick sides like this.  Second of all, why are pwBPD allowed to move on without doctors trying desperately to “cure” them, when that’s all anyone wants to do for pwNPD?  I don’t think being “cured” should be expected of us; it likely can’t be fully done, and we’d need a fuckton of resources to even get close (which almost nobody’s willing to provide).  And I don’t think BPD should just be fully accepted and seen as “not a problem”.  I doubt any of us can be cured, but we can get better with therapy and medication.  That should be fully expected of pwBPD, and nothing beyond that should be expected of pwNPD.  

To sum up, (in the eyes of society), pwNPD need to be “cured” and pwBPD need to be babied and pitied.  Both are degrading.  They shouldn’t be expecting too much or too little of us based on which of these (again, very similar) disorders we have.  It’s fucked up.  

What’s with these crazy cluster b stigmas?  How are they all so strikingly different?  My NPDs are literally demons here to manipulate you… my BPDs are fucking incompetent adult-toddlers who need to be coddled… my ASPDs are all fucking dangerous murderers who deserve to be in a padded cell… and the histrionics— no one even talks about them, and when they do, I’ve heard words liek “weird” and “gross”.

Since getting his first outbreak D has been feeling gross and full of shame. He thinks he won’t be able to date again and finds himself undesirable. He doesn’t want to date again. Prior to having HSV he thought it was gross and that anyone having sex with someone who has it is also gross. 

I’ve tried to bring him over to the other way of thinking by being really supportive and empathize. I’ve had a few friends with it so I’ve just been more (mentally) exposed to it and I’m pretty indifferent as long as disclosure happens prior. We’re allconsenting
 adults who can make our own decisions for our health. 

We’ve had some tumultuous relationship time since the my last relationship ending. I was feeling
 frail and taking time for myself. He assumed this meant I was monogamous. After a misunderstanding (I pursued another relationship while he saw that as cheating) D gave me an ultimatum. we agreed to not date till we were on the same page.  

I have potential partners/crush that know my HSV status. I’m interested it pursuing but not at the expense of D. 

I brought up last night that Iam very sorry for the miscommunication and that I never meant harm, we’ve discussed where and how and what the miscommunication happened and I’m left a little empty

He said anyone who’d go on a date jwith me is desperate and thirsty. 

Essentially he doesn’t want me going out on date when he feels too disgusting (because of the HSV) to go on his own dates. 

So his herpes stigmatization is controlling my freedom to date..

There is a large stigma with the way people view Women's marital aids vs Men's marital aids.

The use of dildos has become much less stigmatized in everyday life. It's used as casual jokes, found regularly on shelves in stores, and ultimately are widely accepted as a thing that just is. Granted it's still somewhat stigmatized in conservative circles but as a whole it's very well accepted as just a thing some women have.

However when it comes to the concept of fleshlights (the male equivalent) it's very much the opposite. The stigma surrounding them is still very strong and negative ideas about them are common.

Maybe this will reduce in time but it feels very tied into the social concept of masculinity.

In reality it shouldn't be stigmatized and should be just as normalized as a dildo. Every human has needs and may not always have those needs met. If they want to use a marital aid instead of Mary Palmer and her 5 friends more power to them.",1696532699,stigma

2729,Dear Therapists: This is What BPD Stigma Looks Like,175,ydbfyl,therapyabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapyabuse/comments/ydbfyl/dear_therapists_this_is_what_bpd_stigma_looks_like/,49,"BPD stigma is when you’re feeling depressed and struggling with dark thoughts - yet you cannot tell anyone, including your therapist. Will they take me seriously? Absolutely. Will they use it as proof of BPD? They have in the past. They point to their Bible (DSM), which states: “recurrent suicidal gestures or threats” as a criteria for BPD. 

It doesn’t matter that I’ve battled depression for years and that I have crying spells, feelings of hopelessness and general fatigue. What matters is that I thought of the “S” word. 

So I stay quiet. 

BPD stigma is when you have experienced abandonment as a child, not just once but several times. Children can experience physical, sexual or emotional abuse and neglect. However, for those of us who have experienced abandonment at the hands of the people in charge of caring for us - and those wounds carry on through our lives - that’s a sign of BPD. The Bible lists “fear of abandonment” (FOA) as a criteria. 

It doesn’t matter that my primary caretaker disappeared as punishment for being bad. It doesn’t matter that my caretaker was in a major accident, and they were in a hospital and nobody told me. I was terrified as a child, thinking they were gone for good. It doesn’t matter that throughout my life, I was made fun of and bullied and rejected which made me hesitant to enter new relationships. Healthy people don’t experience FOA. Borderlines do. (That is what a therapist told me once. She also said, “I don’t work ‘with borderlines.’”)

BPD stigma is when your therapist calls you manipulative because as a neurodivergent person, you ask them repeatedly if they can dim the lights or stop tapping their pen on the table. Or, heaven forbid - you make comments on their perpetual lateness. If a client is late, however, let’s castigate them on therapy Facebook groups and throw the book at them. But clients cannot comment on such things. It’s manipulation at its finest.

BPD stigma is when you are dealing with numerous changes and adjustments in life. You feel panicked, tearful, agitated. When you tell your therapist, they give you DBT skills. Sure, let me focus on my breathing and splash cold water on my face. I am sure that will bring back my dead friend, or help me adjust to an intense school program while working 40 hours per week. I have specifically told my therapist I don’t need skills. I already paid for, and competed, an 8 month course. I know my fucking skills; also, it’s common sense as an adult approaching my 40s. Yet I get skills anyway. Why? I “need” them right? 

It doesn’t matter if I’ve, too, experienced physical or emotional abuse growing up. And that today, as a result, I still feel anger. Nobody has processed my anger with me. NO ONE. Not school therapists as I was growing up. Not the therapists I’ve had as an adult. In fact, I’ve never in four years of therapy been asked, “why are you angry?” It’s not fair that as soon as bpd is suspected - my anger is seen as disproportionate and wrong and needing skills. So I hide my anger. 

Let’s not even address my abrupt therapist termination story. That someone can get sad about that, and cry, is evidence of attachment issues and FOA. Right? It doesn’t matter if I was kicked out in the most unethical manner. It doesn’t matter that my therapist explicitly blamed me for her reactions and the termination. All that matters is my grief and shame over a paid professional terminating me after several years of weekly sessions. That’s not right. That’s…. borderline. 

I told my therapist termination story to 10 therapists. They all defended my therapist. Many of them asked me if I have been diagnosed with a personality disorder. Several more of them told me over the phone that the “best treatment for people like me is DBT.” One psychologist asked me, after telling her that I’d already taken DBT: “are you sure?” 

So once again I am shamed into silence. For me, my trauma and sadness become indicative of a much greater problem that is my entire personality. It doesn’t matter if I don’t actually attempt to off myself, and I don’t self harm. It doesn’t matter if I don’t feel numb, and if I don’t experience “affective instability” or split on people. It doesn’t matter that I’m not impulsive. What matters is what They want to hear, and how They want to view me. It’s not fair. 

I haven’t even been diagnosed with BPD. At least not to my knowledge. They just assume, and stigmatize and pathologize me. 

**Dear therapists: Shame on you.** You have branded me with a scarlet letter. It breaks my heart that in an entire lifetime of having to hide my true self, therapy becomes yet another place where I must remain silent.",1666721096,stigma

This was the first time this has ever happened to me. I was diagnosed as an adult with ADHD 20 years ago. I've been on Adderall for the majority of the time since. Over these many years,  I have done my due diligence with my doctor to find the right drug and dose.  It took many trial and errors to learn my metabolism and what works for me. I've been on my current dose, Adderall IR 20mg 4 times a day, for almost 5 years.  I've been going to the same hometown chain pharmacy for the past 12 years until the shortage. Since the shortage, and for the past 6 months I've had to call each month to find a pharmacy with stock available. 

This month, my hometown pharmacy finally had it back in stock so I had it filled there, just like I did for 12 years before the shortage.  I called beforehand to assure they had my dosage and enough for my prescription, and they did. Yesterday I waited 35 minutes in the drive through line to be told that they didn't fill it because they said it was too early as I had just picked it up on the 10th. I corrected their mistake. They had incorrectly read the dates wrong on my chart, and realized it said 6/10/22 and not 6/10/23.  They apologized and said to come in the store and they would have it filled in less than 10 minutes. 

I went into the store and after another 45 minutes, I went up to the window to ask about the status.  As soon as I said my name for them to check, the pharmacist said loudly, ""I am not filling that.""  I asked him why and he said that no one needs to be on Adderall 4 times a day and that he would lose his license if he filled it. His demeanor was rude, abrupt, and unprofessional. The conversation continued for a minute or two, with him basically telling me (and the whole store) that it was an illegal dosage and he refused to fill it. It was humiliating and it was the first time someone blatantly made me feel like a criminal or drug addict. I was shocked, embarrassed, and speechless.  I left the store in tears. 

I made a complaint with the corporate office yesterday on how I was treated. I explained how I understood that a pharmacist has certain protocols they must follow, and if they didn't fill it because of a protocol that was one thing.  But my problem was because they made me wait for so long, only to tell me that they refused to fill it, and saying so in a very unprofessional and public manor.

Today I spoke with the local store manager to inquire if they were going to fill my prescription or not.  He consulted with a different pharmacist that was on duty, and he said that they now ""feel uncomfortable"" filling it. The manager told me that his regional manager would be in touch with me today to discuss further. I didn't reveal the name of the pharmacy yet, because I am going to give them the opportunity to rectify this situation before I do so.  I understand someone having a bad day, and I'm not going to tarnish a store if they end up doing the right thing. But right now I am infuriated to say the least. (And I didn't know that a pharmacist could refuse to fill a prescription if they were ""uncomfortable"". I'll be looking in to this promptly as this is baffling.)

First, this is a prescription that I have been on for years and that this store has a long history of filling.  My doctor, the one who knows me medically inside and out, wrote a legal prescription that has been blessed many times over by my insurance company. But only now it's a problem? Could it be because of the shortage, and they are hoarding for some reason or another? Secondly, and the worst of it,  that a pharmacist would loudly and publicly announce that he refused to fill it and continued on making me feel like an illicit drug seeker in front of 20-30 people. It was a gut punch to say the least. 

It's hard enough having ADHD, it makes it double hard to deal with the stigma of our medication, and now, triple hard because of the shortage. ADHD meds and dosage are not a ""one size fits all"".  I come from a family of ADHD sufferers, and none of us have the exact same prescription. And at least for me, as I've aged and physically changed, what worked for me some time ago, may not work as well in the present.  

At this time, my Adderall wears off after 1 hr. and 45 minutes.  I wait longer than that to take the next dose so that I am taking it as prescribed and so I will have enough meds for the month.  It's a constant and every day battle keeping my levels even enough to prevent that abrupt ""drop off"" I feel when it's no longer actively working, and at the same time, try to space the doses out between each other so that I have enough to get through the day.  

(I was on extended release many years ago, only to discover that my metabolism kept it in my system too long and it disrupted my sleep to the point that I was put on Ambien. And then Ambien turning out to be a curse disguised as a blessing because of it's addictiveness. Long story short, I can only take immediate release if I care at all about having a natural and unmedicated sleep cycle.)

Since my diagnosis, I have become the biggest ADHD advocate. I speak openly and unapologetically about this condition. I do my best to share information with anyone and everyone in hopes to help others on this journey.  I'm not glad this happened to me yesterday, but I am glad that it lead me to find this reddit group.  And if anything I've written resonated with anyone in a supportive way, than I'm glad I posted.

She asked me why i struggle to eat sometimes and i said it’s got to do with my executive function, i like cooking but can find it boring and sometimes feels like too big of a task, i’m also indecisive as hell and often just don’t eat meals when i can’t decide. Or if i’m doing a task i’ll often forget to eat. I feel like majority of people with adhd could relate to that. She then goes on to make the whole rest of the session about my adhd. She said she can’t believe how everyone thinks they have adhd these days especially women, and that so many women come to her with adhd and blame all their problems on adhd. Then she said that no one in her day had adhd and that no one took ritalin, and apparently too many kids take it these days. Like, wtf? i literally WISH i was diagnosed as a child so i could’ve had Ritalin, my whole childhood would’ve been so much easier.

When I decided to get therapy, friends patted me on the back for overcoming the barrier of the stigma that comes with it, for taking the ""brave step"" of getting help.

I honestly don't give a fuck about the stigma. Therapy is so goddamn expensive. Insurance doesn't cover it a lot of the time. Even the therapists my insurance will cover, it's still a $60 copay, that's still 240 dollars a month.

So many people say things like ""Everyone should get therapy! Therapy is great! I encourage YOU to get therapy!"" It's like they think that we don't already *want* therapy. A lot of us *want* therapy, or desperately *need* it. We just can't justify the expense. I get it. It's all coming from a place of good intentions, but it's frustrating to hear.

I'm finally at a place where I can afford it. They are correct. Therapy is awesome. I really could have used this when I had the financial stress and anxiety of being in college. I'm barely justifying spending this kind of money now, at 60 dollars a week, but I thought it'd be a healthy way to help me get through COVID.

My friend has been leveling a pally and was really interested in dungeon tanking on him. We usually play as a trio and he is currently perfect for Deadmines. He’s level 23, full blacksmithing and bought gear, all spells to this point bought, he has consecration and righteous fury, no reason in my mind he couldnt tank a deadmines run.

We start putting a group together and find a mage. We’re a trio so we only need a healer now. We find a pally healer, he dips right after joining. Then we find a 22 priest. Perfect! We’re well over leveled and should have a really safe run. The priest asks who’s tanking so I name my friend. He drops group immediately. I whispered him and asked why and I got a “pally tank no no no go gl”. This happened with two more healers before we gave up. 

I played a pally tank all the way through classic and remember it being safe and a blast. He’s our open world tank and I’ve never had agro problems against him. (I’m a rogue and my other friend is a mage so both single target and aoe). 

I’m just wanting to get community opinions on this. Should I just tell him to give up and it’s not viable? Is there something we’re missing? 

For clarification:

Yes I am aware paladins don’t have a taunt. This is strictly for dungeon leveling.

I don't want to be a Debby downer; I am loving the expansion! All the open world stuff is really enjoyable and feels like a fun chilled out community for the most part. Really loving it.

I am a tank main, have been for 3 expansions now. I've done up to 20+ keys with pugs, and if I'm honest I've never felt more bullied in my life on how to tank lmao.

It's not even season one yet, and mythic 0's really aren't that hard. I mostly run them for gear and to try and learn mechanics/pathing. I don't go abnormally slow but it's most definitely not 20+ pace by any means!

**I have had more people pulling extra packs (on purpose), telling me to go faster, which path to take,  etc...** Than a typical 10-20+ pugged key

I have done each new dungeon probably 3-5x, along with researching mechanics and such. I am not doing anything abnormally wrong. I just don't understand... There's no time limit, there's no upgrading key, everything's brand new to a lot of people. Where is the sense of urgency and elitism coming from?

I adopted Josie from my local animal shelter 4 weeks ago. We have been working so hard on training with lots of positive reenforcement (praise and treats), however earlier this week she became extremely ill and was actually admitted to the emergency vet. Until the vets can figure out the root of her stomach issues and/or food allergies, I was told to not give her any treats - only the prescription wet food they sent us home with. It seems that all the training progress we’ve made has disappeared without the use of treats. 

Anyways, as we were walking though our apartment building today after a walk outside, Josie stopped to sniff a cart of cleaning supplies the custodial staff left in the hallway. She was on a leash and I called her name to get her attention so we could keep walking but she ignored me, so I pulled on her leash to get her attention. The custodian was walking back to their cart and saw this and proceeded to scold me about how I “shouldn’t allow such an unfriendly and dangerous dog out in public” and how “dogs like that don’t belong here”.

I hear similarities sometimes when people make posts, but I’ve heard songs that remind me of other songs my whole life. 

Another thing I’ve noticed is that people will compare one of her songs to multiple other songs, but no one ever says that the other people are copying each other if that makes sense? 

Like people said the progression in vampire sounds like lil huddys song, and an older song, but never say lil huddy copied the older song? 

Idk I just don’t get the major hate about it.

EDIT: I’m not even a super fan. I’m 27 and she’s making music in a genre I love. Genuinely surprised I like her because I feel like I’m not the target audience lol 

Also the Taylor swift stuff… idk if there’s beef or not but you think Taylor would be more supportive considering what she went through as a young successful female artist. She was supportive of Olivia until she wasn’t… seems like it changed when Olivia’s success was clearly not a one off. It’s giving jealousy. And what is it with her choosing opening acts that “have beef” with Olivia too? Paramours, the Grace girl, Sabrina… it’s all so weird!

I've been on them since I was 19, and they saved my life. I switched from alprazolam, to clonazepam, and I'm now on diazepam and I am not a drug addict.

When I have gone off of them, I am a complete anxiety ridden mess.

I have tried other medications, they don't work for me.

My psychiatrist and I were talking about it and he feels it's so unfair that because people are un educated about taking the medication properly or because some people become drug addicts (who are most likely using other drugs anyway or are going to ) that benzodiazepines have been stigmatized to the level they have been.

I know people who have been on the same dose of clonazepam, alprazolam, and diazepam daily for 10+ years who are doing great and living functioning normal lives.

If you don't want to take them ? Fine. 

But people need to stop telling new people looking for treatment to not even try them and that they are so addictive and will not help them in the long run. 

I am living proof that long term benzodiazepines can help people live a functional life and also not be an automatic drug addict.

Can anyone else back me up here? I would love to hear from other people who have been using benzodiazepines long term and are literally living a better life and aren't a crazy drug addict like everyone makes us out to be.",1694890811,stigma

For me the prime example is LSA. The all-natural cousin of nasty man made synthetic LSD that is FAR more vasoconstrictive. People seem to forget that a lot of these natural substances are likely developed as a self defense mechanism from predators like insects. 

It's one thing to appreciate mushrooms for their more earthly origin while tripping, but I don't think anyone should make any assumptions as to the safety of a substance based on whether we've found it in nature or not.

I'm under the impression that there was a significant stigma around it. (Though I did hear that it was downgraded from a 'vice' to a 'questionable habit' if you were wealthy.)

But laudanum has opium in it, so how come there wasn't a stigma around laudanum? I don't think it was any secret.

How come the Victorians seemed to know that opium was unhealthy and addictive, and yet the moment they think to mix it with alcohol and sell it without prescription for everything from menstrual cramps to teething pains, they think it's a good idea?

This post is adapted from a comment I made on another recent post.

Here's the question I'd like to put forward: Can we find a way to snark on fundie homeschool *culture* and the fundie parents who forcefully subject their children to it that doesn't denigrate and stigmatize homeschool/ex-homeschool kids more than we already are? 

I'm thinking about remarks like: ""What more could you expect from someone who was homeschooled?"" ""Of course they'd believe that. They were homeschooled!"" ""They're too ignorant to understand this because they're homeschooled."" (Note: these aren't verbatim comments, just examples of what I commonly see not just here, but everywhere).

These are prejudiced generalizations that only serve to amplify the stigma of people whose parents homeschooled them as perpetually intellectually inferior to the rest of society. Our parents are the ones who deserve those judgments, not us, because they're the ones responsible for our (lack of) access to education when we were kids.

My parents were charismatic evangelical Christians who homeschooled me from grades 5–12 and refused to let me attend a “real” school for high school even though I begged them to. I am always extremely hesitant to tell people I was homeschooled because I get heavily stigmatized for it, like it was choice that I had any control over as a child. People interact with me differently after they find out that I was homeschooled. I often feel too ashamed to ever talk about it.

But my parents are the ones who deserve that shame and stigma, not me. My parents bear the full responsibility for any deficits I might’ve had because they actively and willingly deprived me of all access to a standard education against my own desires and best interests. I was a child, and so were the fundies who get snarked on here. And as a child subjected to my parents’ authority and discipline like all children are, my control over my own education was limited to searching the library and the internet to fill in all the gaping holes on my own. Then I got punished for wanting to attend “real” school with my peers instead.

No child should ever be held responsible for their own learning like that. And no person should be teased, demeaned, belittled, or criticized because their parents failed in one of their most basic responsibilities as providers. My parents threatened and intimidated me into homeschooling. My closest friends who were homeschooled experienced similar intimidation from their parents, too. But we’re the ones who get the shame and stigma aimed at us, not our parents where 100% of the blame and responsibility actually belongs.

I’d like to see this sub implement some guidelines around directing homeschool snark squarely towards the parents who choose and enforce it on their kids, because that’s where the snark belongs. Snarking on people because they were homeschooled by their parents disrespects everyone who experienced that form of neglect in our own childhood homes and can even be re-traumatizing for some of us. I know I’m not the only homeschooler-in-recovery who hangs around this sub. Could we snark on the fundie homeschool culture itself instead of on individuals for being forcefully subjected to that culture as children?",1644154269,stigma

2836,The classist stigma around “made-up” names and “made-up” spellings,1184,mhyj9m,namenerds,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/mhyj9m/the_classist_stigma_around_madeup_names_and/,557,"(Example names have been slightly altered to protect privacy of students)

I currently live and work in a city that’s sort of struggling financially. Most of the people who live here are working-class. I work in childcare. 

Before I moved here, I was working with children in a wealthy area. All of my students had “normal” names in the context of their families’ cultural backgrounds. I thought the “made-up names” thing was just some weird stereotype about Americans or Millennials or something. When I moved to a working-class area, I discovered that making up names is *totally* a thing, but in my opinion, the negative attitude towards it is more of a classist stigma than anything else, and if it weren’t for that classist stigma, there would be absolutely nothing wrong with making up a name for your kid. 

There are two main types of made-up names: made-up spellings of already-established names, and names that are newly invented, usually comprised of syllables from established names. An example of the former would be Kolten. An example of the latter would be KayBria. 

Honestly, if I try my best to erase the stigma and stereotypes from my mind, I really like the concept of made-up names. 

My coworker has a student called Jasmia. I’d never heard the name Jasmia, but if you love the name Jasmine and like the “ia” suffix, why the heck can’t you call your kid Jasmia?

One of my students is Delaynie. Personally, I prefer the traditional spelling, Delaney, but if you like the name Delaney but find “ie” to be more aesthetically pleasing than “ey”, why the heck can’t you name your kid Delaynie?

Having the freedom to make something up instead of being restricted to a list of “real” names is a pretty cool thing that I’d never really thought about until now.

Pretty much every problem with made-up names could be solved if we as a society collectively decided to tear down the stigma. 

Hiring discrimination? Currently it’s a problem of course, but if schools and companies started training future and current HR and hiring committee members to recognize and actively reject their biases, it could be a thing of the past for the next generation.

Having your name misspelled and mispronounced all the time? Teachers and aspiring teachers are already being taught to ask and double-check with *every* student to make sure they are spelling and pronouncing their name correctly. If this continues to become more common in schools and elsewhere, soon enough there won’t be any difference in convenience between having a common name and having a made-up name. 

Think about a hypothetical world where made-up names aren’t associated with a lower education level or economic status. Let’s be real, is there any non-stigma-related reason why making up a name to bestow upon your child is a bad idea?",1617293140,stigma

Back in 2007 I was in Portland, Oregon with my wife (who is a VERY docile, gentle woman) and we went to a heavy metal concert at the Roseland Theater. 

After the show, as we were walking back to my car some drunk bitches started trying to pick a fight with my wife. My wife and I are tall, broad shouldered people (6'1 and 5'11, respectively) but we're not the 'violent' type and we don't try to intimidate anyone.

These 3 drunk bitches essentially attack my wife because A) they are drunk B) they are probably stupid and C) they think because my wife is tall and German she is probably mean.

When they think I'll just stand around and watch my gentle giant of a wife get beaten up because I'm a dude and they are chicks... I unload on them and beat the shit out of all 3 of these dumb whores quite easily. I think I might have even broken one of their noses.

Relaxing in bed, on the couch with your feet up, as it rains outside and you're warm inside, you feeling cool in an air conditioned living room on a blazing summer day and just being engrossed in a book. The smell of the book and the sound of the pages being turned can almost be ritualistic.

That being said, the primary act of reading is to enjoy the story. People often complain about not having the time to read when I mention a good book. So a little back story, I had brain surgery 5 years ago and while the results were good I've been left with vision and neck problems (parinauds syndrome and double vision) which makes reading more of a chore than a pleasure. So I turned to audiobooks, I've read over 60 books that I've kept track of (possibly more) on Audible and old school CD based books; books that even with perfect vision and no neck pain I'd never have read. It works great for me, I can 'read' while cooking, cleaning or enjoy it like a normal book and lay back in bed or on the couch, close my eyes and engross myself.

However whenever I tell people this I often find myself defending it when they say I cheat.. as if reading is some competition and you only get credit if you physically read the pages. Yes I can and do use my condition as an excuse but I shouldn't have to defend myself because I read my books in a different way.

To me, being a successful author means having an agent, traditional publishing. However, this isn’t a possibility for most writers.

I’ve done the querying process before. As we know, it sucks. It’s soul destroying and awful but has the potential to pay off. 

Due to life and career changes, I’ve been out of the self publishing world since 2017. Even though there are many successful self published authors, I want the “real deal”. I tried before and failed. I’ll probably fail again. 

No matter what, there’s been a stigma attached to self publishing. Vanity publishing, social stigma, etc. 

Having some sort of success with my writing is really important to me. I’ve not been successful in anything else other than my writing. Landing an agent and getting that validation would change my life. It would let me know I’m worthy, that my writing is valid.  Maybe that’s wrong but it’s how I feel.

As someone who finds themselves in that category, I'm looking for ideas on how to mitigate this.

The first, best advice I find is to put focus towards a more RP character, and one that is less about ""winning"" things like combat or skill checks. That's great, and I love that. Definitely have done this and will continue to do so.

What if there's some of us who might like a shot at the other aspects of the game, though? Surely there are ways to help with statistically high percentages of failed rolls. For example, a couple options that come to mind are the *Lucky* feat and the level 11 Rogue ability *Reliable Talent*.

Here's the question then. Are there character build options like these which incorporate features that specifically help improve odds of die rolls, create opportunities for re-rolls, or give things like advantage consistently?

*Not interested in suggestions like, ""embrace the bad rolls"" or ""bad rolls create RP situations"". Those topics have been fully explored in other discussions.*

I’d love to hear other people’s experiences with it as well - good, bad, and neutral so we can get a wider overview. I personally take the brand name Ozempic at the .25mg dose, though other injectables like Wegovy and Mounjaro, as well as the tablets like Rybelsus all fall under the umbrella of semaglutide. 

My weight loss journey started young, maybe when I was twelve or thirteen, but I’ll just talk about the two most recent ones because they’re the most interesting to compare. When I was 20, I lost 70 pounds (230>160) in 2 years by following an intensive regime of CICO, meal prep, intermittent fasting, and daily exercise. Y’all were quite proud of me at the time as I did it all the “right way”!

I was able to maintain for about a year until I began having severe symptoms no one could really explain. I ended up being diagnosed with osteoporosis, a sleep disorder, a nutritional deficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety, depression, and fibromyalgia. What followed was a six year losing battle to keep weight off while throwing the majority of my energy into managing my symptoms well enough to live in the world. I gained 100 pounds, then 20 more during the pandemic.

Last May, my birth mother died of complications of Type 2 Diabetes, and in an effort to get the best preventative diabetes treatment plan, I sought expert medical advice from a private practice endocrinologist. I was quickly diagnosed with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia - I had a *crazy high* amount of insulin in my system for someone who was not diabetic. Like, 20 times the amount of insulin I needed in my blood at all times to manage a regular amount of blood sugar. It had never been caught because hilariously, my blood sugar is always perfect as well as my A1C, but it would eventually cause an unmanageable combination of type I & type II diabetes by shutting down my pancreas and making my body unresponsive to insulin. We can’t be sure what caused this, but it’s likely a combination of genetic factors and prenatal exposure to uncontrolled diabetes. Either way, I started treatment immediately. 

I took Metformin for the first year. Lost 30 pounds with small changes to my routine and also literally cured most of my issues (except the spinal fractures lol). I plateaued in March so my endo suggested taking things to the next level with Ozempic. Metformin did a lot for me but she is right, semaglutide has stepped things up. I already felt better but now I can confidently say that I feel awake, alert, and relatively pain free for the first time since my early teens. I also don’t feel a constant, gnawing starvation pain that I must overcome - a feeling I used to think of as just “regular hunger” because it was all I knew. 

The lifestyle changes I consciously followed while on Metformin have become intuitive. For instance, it is pleasant to exercise every other day when you’re muscles can efficiently convert blood sugars into useful ATPs - it doesn’t cause me pain and I recover quickly! It also also easier to do just about every single thing when you’re not constantly hurting and falling asleep. For example, I can almost always muster the energy to cook for myself. On top of it all, I am no longer contending with all of that insulin in my blood screaming desperately for more sugar 24/7. The mental quietude is astonishing and instead of fighting with my cravings, I can put that energy elsewhere. 

So yeah. I haven’t lost much yet, maybe three pounds a month? But I feel normal, possibly for the first time in my entire life. I’m also probably not going to develop diabetes now, which means it won’t kill me in my 50’s, like it did to my birth mother. In general, I don’t really care what others think of me but I worry people will keep away from this medication because of the stigma. There are a legitimate number of reasons not to take it. To name a few: it is expensive, it’s a shot, it’s possibly lifelong, some of the side effects people experience are harsh… But it is not “cheating”. It is not “the easy way out”. It is not “just an appetite suppressant” or otherwise somehow symbolic of your moral failures as a fat person. It’s a medication that treats a disorder and like all medications your doctor may suggest, it is a tool.

[**ORIGINAL POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bmb8j3/im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming_isolated/) \- 9th May 2019

Long backstory short, I was lonely in college and befriended one of the only people on campus who was nice to me: a gentle gay cafeteria worker who turned out to be an HIV survivor from the '80s. Like many veteran HIV patients, he has complicated health problems stemming from going years without treatment or with limited, inappropriate treatment (i.e. toxic doses of AZT by itself), as well as deep emotional scars.

Whenever we talked/cried/prayed about it together, he swore me to secrecy. No problem - HIV disclosure outside the bedroom is the individual's choice, and often a fraught one.

One day he didn't text me back. The drug cocktail he'd been using with relative success for years had stopped working unexpectedly. One minute he was calling a dermatologist about removing Kaposi sarcoma that had come back for (he thought) no reason, and the next minute his husband had to decide whether or not to keep him on a ventilator. He was in a Glasgow 3 coma for a month. They're doing amazing things with medicine these days, so he made it to the step-down unit and has a good chance of long-term survival. He hasn't learned to talk through his trach yet, but he's ""all there"" mentally - he recognizes familiar people, nods and shakes, smiles and grimaces, mouths words, attempts to charm the physical therapist out of making him do things, and has intact television preferences. However, the nature and extent of his complications mean he's facing a long recovery, permanent status as an AIDS patient, and possible disability/reduced QoL.

I visit him in the hospital every weekday, when it is convenient for me but not his husband or sister-in-law. I give pep talks and bring cards and gifts (I'm going a little broke, hahaha.) My level of dedication increased when I discovered that I'm truly one of the only people who knows he's sick and therefore one of the only people who's visiting. ""Don't tell anyone I'm sick"" is an easy request until you walk into someone's hospital room and find them alone again with no new cards. His sister-in-law and extremely stressed husband tell me to keep doing what I'm doing, but I feel like I can't provide the level of rallying-around my friend needs by myself. The doctors and nurses agree. They know the signs of depression in nonverbal patients and have prescribed antidepressants. They practically cheer when I walk in the door.

I just feel so stymied by my inability to call in reinforcements. GoFundMe? Out of the question. r/RandomActsofCards? In my dreams. Inviting friends and volunteers to come visit him without telling them what's actually wrong? Alas, he has a very specific ""look"" which I'm told Americans over 35, plus anyone who's been on missions to Africa, can recognize instantly. Every door I approach here seems to have a sign on it reading, ""screw you, it's AIDS."" This guy has so many friends and acquaintances in regular life, yet he's so lonely. It's horrible, but I can't out him. I don't want his first post-coma words to be ""Did that bitch tell people I have HIV!?"" I feel boxed in and don't know what to do. Any kind of advice, Reddit?

**TL;DR** my friend is in the hospital because he did the gay without a condom over three decades ago. He kept his illness a secret and is therefore getting few visitors, cards, and gifts, and I am afraid he will fall into despair due to social isolation. However, I can't tell his other friends what's going on because he doesn't want them to know about the time over three decades ago when he did the gay without a condom.

 

[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c2sc74/update_im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming/) \- 20th June 2019

In the original post, I described the predicament of my dear friend, a >30-year HIV survivor who suffered massive inexplicable treatment failure and was alone all day in the hospital because his husband was at work and he'd kept his condition a secret. I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad.

I'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones.

His suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone. How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him.

I'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that point. He said, ""you're so good to me."" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end.

On social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but minus all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion.

I don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes.

**TL;DR** rest in peace my beautiful friend

&#x200B;

**EDIT** \- Wow, this post exploded. I am overwhelmed by all the condolences and well wishes and unusable throwaway karma coming my way. You're all the kind heart of Reddit. And you like my writing? That's too much. Stop it.

People are asking why I think I'm a bad person. The answer is that I was diagnosed (probably correctly) with an autism spectrum disorder in my teens and told that my social deficits were caused by failure to develop the capacity for empathy. There is now tons of pushback on this theory of autism, but it was dominant at the time. I was vulnerable and impressionable and I thought, ""Oh no, I'm a sociopath. I'll have to spend the rest of my life hiding how rotten I am inside."" I mope about my moral fiber the way other women mope about their weight. I'm doing it right now, fretting over whether this post is narcissistic.

My friend showed me another side to myself, a bright mirror. He changed my life. Losing him is heartbreaking.

I live with my parents and everyone in my home eats non-veg (Chicken/Lamb/Fish). However, we (the family) have been eating non-veg hiding from society. We own our own house/bungalow and not on a rent in some flat. Still we eat meat, which is completely a legal thing in India, in shadows. I have never received an answer from my parents to why we do it but there are a few things that come to my mind:

1. What if somebody in society realizes that we eat meat? You will not get another Gujarati girl to marry you. Cool. Stupid, but I can see some logic behind that.
2. What if somebody sees us eating meat? They'll consider us lower caste. (PS: We are Patels, and I have yet to meet another Patel who does not eat at least eggs)
3. Another reason I can think of is what if there are communal riots like those happened in 2003? May be Hindus will attack us as well? (A stupid fear, I think. I am not saying that my father/mother has said this as a reason, but I believe this is somewhere hidden in their minds)

Funny thing is, I lived in USA. I ate every possible meat that was offered to me. I ate frogs, octopus, all kinds of fish, beef, chicken, turkey, jerky (deer), etc. and yet, I am afraid of ordering Chicken from BigBasket in Ahmedabad since BB delivers meat in a transparent bag and I am afraid my neighbor will see it.

2879,Why the nipple shield stigma?,70,13tvohr,breastfeeding,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/13tvohr/why_the_nipple_shield_stigma/,148,"Edit: I mention EP because I doubt I would have tried a shield if I hadn’t been given one due to all the negativity I’ve seen around shields so I would still be EP. Pumping was the hardest thing for me so I have huge respect for all the pumpers out there!

I often see women say the reason they went EP is because their baby wouldn’t latch. Did these women try a nipple shield? It seems like if a baby can drink from a bottle they can use a nipple shield (I am only meaning with latching not milk transfer) I use a nipple shield with my preemie, I wasn’t even shown latching techniques in the NICU they just gave me a nipple shield and said “you can BF him”. I went through a phase once we were home of desperately wanting him to latch without it. Every feed I thought about how good it’ll be when he doesn’t use the shield. I spent hours combing the internet to find out how I could latch him with my nipple type. I discovered the flipple technique a couple of weeks ago and he has latched a few times and transferred milk for a few minutes but he thrashes around a lot so comes off and gets angry. But once I knew he could latch without the shield I almost stopped caring, I haven’t attempted to latch him without the shield for a couple of days because I’m not even thinking about it. 
I feel like there is a lot of misinformation and stigma about nipple shields which made me want to stop using it so desperately. The thought of women giving up on BF when they haven’t even tried a shield upsets me a little! I’m also upset that I become so desperate to stop using the shield. 
I no longer care if my baby always needs the shield because I’m so grateful for it! I think the nipple shield is a beautiful tool and it’s not celebrated enough! 

What’s your shield experience? Did your baby need it forever? Did they seem to just not need it one day? Did you never try using one but wish you did?

Growing up the main negative stereotype I heard about bisexual men was that they didn't exist or were extremely extremely rare, and then on the flipside I got told stuff like 'all women are bisexual' etc. When I was older though I started to learn all these other stigmas that I'd never heard of like that straight women typically think its unappealing to have a bi male partner and that bisexual men are believed to just be gay men in denial etc, cheaters etc etc.

What the f-ck?

Why all of the hate I don't get it? Bisexual men are really unlikely to come out because of stuff like this and it's awful. I don't see how your ego could be so fragile you'd refuse to date a bisexual man just because you think he'll leave you for a guy.

For me if I was gonna date a guy it would be a huge plus if he was bi because then we could relate to so many things. I'd probably prefer to date a bisexual man than a straight man.

We have to support our bi men because statistically their life prognosis isn't great compared to other LGBT members, which experts believe is related to biphobia, and lack of resources in the community. They are even more disadvantaged than bisexual women in a lot of these studies, especially regarding media representation and economic earnings (UK).

Bi men are real, they are more common than you think, and they deserve to be protected and fought for by all of us.

Edit: I'm not trying to say that bisexual women have it easier than bisexual men. In fact, I think the fact that we're more likely to be accepted as bisexual by an opposite sex partner is due to fetishization, not actual acceptance, and that this contributes to greater risks of sexual violence against  bisexual women compared to other sexual minorities. Bisexual women face a lot of biphobia as well, in ways that are much more severe than bisexual men in certain areas and are often compounded by misogyny. Bisexual men are especially lacking however compared to bisexual women statistically in mental health, economic earnings (UK), and media representation. I think that not talking about the issues bisexual men face contributes to these issues and I think we should do more to support bisexual men.

The car business and those that work in it do not have a very good reputation for honesty. I know that many of us are working to change that. Yet many customers will not accept it. 

Yesterday morning I had a customer come in for a test drive on a new car. They looked at a few cars and discussed their options. We had her perfect car here. She agreed it was perfect but wanted to talk to her mom. I explained it was not only the only one we had. But the only one matching her picky specs within 600 miles. She said she had to talk to her mom first. Okay cool. My manager said hi and they left. A customer came in later that day and was planning to look at the car. I called my customer and gave her first right of refusal. Hey they seem like they might buy it. If you want to commit to it, we can hold it until you can pick it up. “I know what you’re trying to do. I know my rights. I’m still going to think on it”. I explained I was trying to get her the only car out there that she wanted at the deal she wanted. “I’ve heard about the games and saying it’s “selling” is one of them. I’ll let you know Monday. 

Okay well I wasn’t lying. It sold to my other customer. Idrc. I sold it either way. She just texted me. “Hey I’m ready to move forward. When can I pick it up?”  Um as I said yesterday a customer was looking to buy it. And they bought it. “I thought you were trying to pressure me”. Nope. I’ll check tomorrow and let you know how much from your dream car we need to deviate.

I do, absolutely. 
But WHY the general public always seem to lean towards ONE side of the story? 
I've always felt more sympathy towards ""the bad ones"", since people with BPD are always portrayed as monsters. I've read terrible things, like ""you shouldn't even spend therapy money on them, it's a waste of time"" 
""Leave them alone"" 
""they're demons"" 
But WHY can't they understand that we are humans too? 
Why the ""understandings"" always come after others, but never for us? 
I didn't choose to have a mental disorder. I didn't choose to be neglected as a child or to have a disturbed mom as well. 
Also, I don't get why they think we're all the same. 
BPD comes with different traits and therefore there could be A LOT of combinations. 
I consider myself ""lucky"" as I am very aware of my mechanisms and why I do certain things, thanks to years and years of therapy (I started at 13/14, now I'm basically 24) and I refuse to be compared to someone who doesn't even want to seek help.

Now, I (40s F) have been in a lot of therapy, read a lot of self-help type books and consider myself to be pretty relationally aware. I've done a lot inner work in the last 5 years to understand how my family of origin impacted my perceptions of marriage, why I picked those partners, what my role was in the relationship that contributed to unhealthy dynamics, and what/how I would do it differently. 

And yet, as someone who values loyalty, commitment and partnership (at times over compatibility) I still have trouble with the stigma that I have been divorced twice. For example, a recent date told me that raised a red flag for him. And the other day, a family member crassly said, ""listen, just date, don't get married again."" Oof...I can feel the shame rising to the surface.

I listen to a podcast by Henry Cloud the other day and had a lightbulb moment. He was speaking to a women with a similar situation as mine (very accomplished professionally, socially, etc. with two ""failed"" marriages), and he said: marriage takes teamwork and those people were not team players. 

That was true for me as well. 

Honestly, I do not desire to get married again at this point. And though I can intellectualize why those marriages ended and have learned a lot of rich lessons from walking though those fires, I still feel myself carrying this stigma around, especially in a society that values longevity of marriages as a sign of success, despite relational health and happiness.

Don’t Punish**  

*Wednesday, 26 June 2022 (on reddit)* – **Today**, /r/drugs, /r/researchchemicals, /r/LSD, /r/stims, /r/reagenttesting, a reddit coalition of 200 subreddits go private and ask all regular visitors of these subreddits to **share how they feel about the communities they visit**, have they helped them in any way, did you get the information as a teen that you needed to not die, was there support when you needed it, did the recovery subreddits help you /u/spez when you needed support, or do you support others? We want to send  u reddit and /u/spez a message that all these vulnerable communities are important and save lives every day 24/7. 

The date of the launch is not coincidental. 26th June marks the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking – a day many governments around the world commemorate by celebrating their records on drug arrests, seizures, and even to execute people condemned for drug-related offences. 

#The drug related subreddits community

•	Do NOT promote drug use  
•	[Accept, for better and or worse, that licit & illicit drug use is part of our world and chooses to work to minimize its harmful effects rather than simply ignore or condemn them](https://harmreduction.org/about-us/principles-of-harm-reduction/);  
•	Utilizes evidence-based, feasible, and cost-effective practices to prevent and reduce harm;  
•	Calls for the non-judgmental, non-coercive provision of services and resources to people who use drugs  

Making a [subreddit NSFW out of nowhere without even getting in touch with the moderators beforehand](https://i.imgur.com/TqAc7YL.png) is not how community management works. We’re dealing with stigma, fear, violence, death and shame every single day. If reddit really want to follow their mission. Furthermore, scientific research proves that [Teens prefer harm reduction messaging on substance use](https://news.ubc.ca/2019/04/25/teens-prefer-harm-reduction-messaging-on-substance-use/). Using the argument that the subreddit is only for adults is actually harming teens because especially they need and want easy access to harm reduction information.  

>Our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. As we move towards this goal with different initiatives from different parts of the org, it's important to remember that we're in this together with one shared goal above all others.

##Reddit should put its money where its mouth is and support vulnerable communities that add value to the world by supporting those that need it the most right now. 

Currently the drug market is unregulated, drug checking options are limited, the DEA spreads misinformation (I fact checked their 'fact sheets'; rate most F based on the 5000 research papers about drugs and harm reduction I’ve read and can share), there's a giant stigma towards People Who Use Drugs (PWUD). In the US alone 120,000 people died from drug poisoning. These are all preventable deaths.  

The problem is a lot of people under 18 come into possession of drugs but thankfully come to Reddit for pointers and tips where people have legit saved lives by informing people on their dosages or urging medical care to an obvious overdose to a teen who is terrified. We’re going to lose that ability to intervene. And it’s damaging. It’s the same thing “Dare” does. Drugs are bad an evil. And you shouldn’t even look at them or touch them. 
Nothing teaches you what the fuck to do when you Do touch them. When you come into a bad crowd. When you get bored. When you got some money to blow. When your parents are out of town.   
###Nobody has to feel any fear or judgement when posting and seeking advice. None of us pretend to be doctors or medical experts. We just wanna help. And we only help those that reach out and ask. 

Dear /u/Reddit please don't punish our fragile communities with ridiculous NSFW stigmatization and give us the support we need to stay alive and save more lives. 

**Please** *just do this one thing*.

A bit of a rant and a bit of a discussion here.

I am just about to finish uni, and would like to move out in the not too distant future. This obviously gives an enormous sense of independence that I am very keen for. On the other hand, however, if one's living situation at home is not all that bad (meaning child doesn't leave because environment is toxic, abusive etc), why is it viewed so negatively to live at the family home?

I am not saying that I want to freeload. I already pay board, share cooking/ cleaning/ shopping/ laundry etc. Once I start my grad role, I intend to increase my board. I will also have more time to do more chores once uni is done, as you would living anywhere (no longer having to work 20 hours a week around classes, then study late nearly every night �). 

So surely staying at home is mutually beneficial? I would rather my retired parent reduce her super pension payments so that it lasts her longer (no, I'm not after her money but no one has a crystal ball, and reducing dependency on investments is surely a good thing). I also can live more cheaply than elsewhere, save more, and eventually aim to buy my own place. The dating argument is somewhat valid, but not insurmountable with good communication. I have a partner, and she stays over. My parent and I communicate about what is awkward and what's OK and we make it work. 

Now on the other hand, I am viewed as a slacker if I stay at home. Apparently I  game till 2am every night, can't cook, and can't operate a washing machine. You can live a good, adult life at home (to a certain extent, I'm not advocating to *never* move out). Why the stigma? Why is intergenerational living not accepted in Australia?

Of course I want to move out. Of course I want to be independent. If the housing/ rental market is off its chops, however, then is the alternative really that I am just a man-child?",1684451084,stigma

Sono un uomo del tutto normale fisicamente (mi sono sempre allenato, da adolescente ero atleta con discreti risultati regionali), con un lavoro fisso ed un mare di passioni che spaziano dalla fotografia alla scrittura (ho anche pubblicato qualcosa qua e là) alla musica. Per dire: posso godere benissimo sia di un concerto dei Rammstein che di una serata a teatro. Apprezzo la buona cucina, l'unica cosa che detesto sono i luoghi iper affollati senza motivo apparente ma basta schivarli, no?

Eppure eccomi qua a non battere chiodo. Mica da mesi, da anni.

E' come se fossi entrato in un loop per il quale il genere femminile tutto mi schiva. La situazione è profondamente autoironica a tratti ma sta diventando difficilmente sopportabile perché il tempo scorre ed inesorabilmente sembra che la società non trovi spazio per una persona sola.

Il 90% degli amici nella mia compagnia è sposato o fidanzato, frequento anche senza continuità altre compagnie con le quali però il rapporto non è così confidenziale e continuativo: non c'è quindi margine di manovra per trovare una partner. Magari la classica uscita alla ""ti presento Tizia"" ma finisce lì senza troppi sviluppi importanti.

Che poi: per me non sarebbe nemmeno un grosso problema restare scapolo. Ma da fuori lo stigma è forte, pesante, asfissiante. E non vivo nemmeno in un remoto paesino dove ci si fidanza tra cugini. Solo che sembra quasi diventata una condanna ed anche il ritrovarsi con persone fidanzate sembra quasi un segno di vivere in un'altra dimensione.

Per dirne una qualche giorno fa Regione Emilia Romagna ha lanciato un bando per il sostegno all'acquisto di case in montagna. Dedicato però a ""giovani coppie"", non a giovani single.

But I really loathe the negative stigma that male advocacy and also being in any way liberal or left-wing has. You bring up issues affecting men and boys, and people are quick to assume you're a right-winger, incel, MRA, etc. I don't even like the term ""men's rights"" due to the negative stink around it (and plus just like women's rights, too one-sided a term; equality should mean taking into account everyone's rights). Or if you say you're opposed to wokeism people also assume you're right-wing. Likewise, you in anyway claim to be liberal, progressive, leftist, etc. people automatically assume you're woke or an SJW or a misandrist. You feel like you're in-between a rock and a hard place. So many people on both sides of the spectrum are way too narrow-minded and are like a cyclops in the sense there's only one eye they're looking through. You can advocate for men and boys just as much as women and girls, and bring much-needed attention to issues affecting them that have gone ignored for much too long, and you can still be very liberal while at the same time not being woke. Woke to me if anything is not liberal for the simple fact it ignores the welfare and needs of men and boys, and grants special treatment to certain groups of people because they belong to said groups; which goes against the very nature of equality, for everyone to have the same rights and opportunities, for everyone to have their welfare and needs taken into account and for everyone to have their needs tended to and any inequalities affecting them rectified.

I'm so grateful for this sub. It's great having a friendly male space without right-wing toxicity, which unfortunately has given such a stink to the concept of male advocacy. It sucks how people assume you must be part of the manosphere if you advocate for men, when the manosphere is pretty much just the ultra right-wing version of misandry. A horribly negative and damaging association that needs to be smashed. The association and stigma sucks but at the end of the day, all you can really do is have your own voice, speak your truth and look for like-minded people.",1697000884,stigma

I try to be mindful of this because I know he can't help it, but I just don't have a solid grasp on what sets him off and what doesn't, especially because his preferences always seem to change.

He describes this behavior as ""cleaning,"" or when he's annoyed with me as ""cleaning up after me,"" although it's really nothing of the sort. It's not even really organization; the things never get moved to a designated place, they just go to wherever his whim dictates, whether that place makes sense or not. This results in me frequently losing important items like keys, bills, and things that I'm actively trying to use.

I wouldn't have nearly as much of a problem with this behavior if he cleaned the house in more meaningful ways, but he doesn't.

Sweeping and vacuuming? All me. Dishes? All me. Dusting, cleaning the toilets and shower, any kind of cleaning that actually involves removal of filth? All me. He doesn't usually see me clean because I strongly prefer cleaning when he's out (I work from home, he commutes), but it really should be obvious how much that I contribute.

But that's not how he views things. A couple days ago, as he was doing one of his ""cleaning"" sessions, he started berating me about ""never doing anything to keep the place clean,"" and that he ""cleans up after me all goddamn day."" This set me off because I had just spent a long time earlier that day painstakingly scrubbing every inch of the master bathroom toilet.

I said that I had a hugely disproportionate housekeeping workload and that his habit doesn't count as ""cleaning"" to anyone but him, that the house would be a sty if he was the only one taking care of it, and that he needs to actually start contributing to housework instead of just shuffling stuff around and making me lose my things.

Ever since that argument he's been very short with me and avoiding me. Was I in the wrong here?

Edit: He was diagnosed in his early 20's, before we met. I'm not willing to give too much detail about his experience that made him distrusting of mental health professionals, but it was a very traumatic experience which involved a boundary-violating therapist who used extremely abusive methods.

now, the obvious thing to do would have been for him to say ""excuse me young man. i don't mean to meddle but your tag on the back of your shirt is sticking out. due to my OCD, i am triggered by this so could you please place it back into your shirt"". that would be the obvious thing to do. but instead, he takes it upon himself to do this task for me.

he grabs my tag and stuffs it back into my shirt, causing me to obviously turn around in shock. the old bastard was smiling as he told me ""sorry. i have OCD"". 

i'm sorry but having OCD does not give you a free pass to touch anyone, especially if the person in question is a minor. he's lucky there weren't any managers around to see that because he probably would have left the store at the end of their shoe if they witnessed that. 

thankfully, i never encountered a situation like that again.

moral of the story, thinking that mental illness excuses shitty behavior is not just a gen Z thing.",1690801492,OCD

The mistaken views can be quite damaging and misleading. The compulsions are often a result of an irrational fear of themselves or loved ones becoming sick or die if they don’t perform different actions almost ritually, despite knowing its irrational. A lot of issues regarding mental health has been wrongly portrayed in media and can lead to people not seeking help because they don’t know that their struggles might be treatable.

My wife has severe OCD. It take as toll on her and her self esteem so much. She only goes to my family’s house when she has to she and then aren’t very close. 

My family have been over my house multiple times and my wife is always cleaning, she will clean things 4,5,6 times sometimes more she will open and close the cabinets and fridge door or she will tuck in her hands to her sleeves like sweater paws whenever she opens a door. She will randomly get up from the table and do different things like fix the shoe rack put out dogs leashes and collars in order ect. It does not bother me, just something she can’t control. 

Yesterday was her birthday. family were adamant about them coming over. My mom brother aunt uncle and younger sister, When we got to the present part, my wife opened them. And they explained what each were for. 

&#x200B;

1. Gloves, she needs to wear them all the time since she acts like she can’t open a door without them 
2. Hand soap, since she washes her hands all the time and acts like she could die without it
3. Lotion because she wash’s a her hands so much that they look disgusting 
4. Cleaning supplies (three bags of it) since she’s always cleaning so much we got you some to clean our house. We need a good cleaner.

My wife was holding back tears and I stopped them before they would give another shitty gift. My wife got up and went to the bathroom. 

I told my mom that it’s ridiculous of her to do this when her own husband has ocd and she’s mocking it like a teenager 

I said as calmly as I could’ve said to get out. Mom pleaded saying it was just some fun. But I responded by saying no one is laughing but you assholes who can’t tell your ass from your elbow but have the nerve to mock a disorder so you can apologize and get the hell out of my house. My aunt said that it wasn’t that big of a deal and nothing they said was wrong. I told her to stop talking to justify her actions, and told them to get out which they did. 

My wife was crying in the bedroom after this and it took a bit to get calm. 

I got a few apologies but majority of them said that it was a funny joke and that I was over reacting and that “insulting their intelligence” was also rude so we should be apologizing to eachother. 

My mother has been blowing up my phone saying that I shouldn’t have said that about her and that it wasn’t that serious.

I told my mom until my wife accepts her apology she’s not coming over and told my aunt uncle and brother that they can piss off until I feel like dealing with 6th graders again. 

I see so many people on here talking about mental illness. It’s hard to believe people are so ignorant to basic facts let alone common sense 

My older sister has said that I was being rude to and I should apologize to them because they didn’t mean any harm and clearly think it was just a joke. 

The only person who is on my side are some of my cousins.

OCD stands for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it is a disorder characterized by unwanted thoughts and fears entering a person's mind, which usually compels them to perform rituals or compulsions in order to rid themselves of the associated anxiety from the thoughts.

Although instances of such behavior do occur in most people, those with the disorder experience these instances far more frequently and more intensely than others.

Although a large percentage of people have heard about the disorder, some the three biggest misconceptions about it are:

1. it is inherently or overwhelmingly linked to cleanliness, orderliness, or tidiness obsessions
2. It is a relatively light and easy-to-manage disorder in comparison to other serious mental health conditions
3. The repeated thoughts, feelings, and urges that enters a person with OCD's mind are because, at least in part, they have some desire to act on their fears, or it aligns with their values

All three points listed are untrue. OCD can take the form of any obsession imaginable (obsessions over certain things are usually referred to as OCD themes or sub-types), and it is unclear whether cleanliness obsessions are even the most common sub-type. In terms of the internal stress it produces, cases of severe OCD are similar to severe cases of PTSD and Schizophrenia, which are generally treated as very serious disorders (which they should be, of course.)

And lastly, the person experiencing the thoughts and fears does so precisely because they do NOT like or want them. If anything, a person's OCD about say, harming their family (a common sub-type) makes them less likely to do so than otherwise.

A list of the most common OCD sub-types can be found below. I would encourage people to read the link, as it may be able to help you identify the disorder in yourself or others, which can lead people to recovery much quicker and easier:

I have done a TON of weird compulsions over the past 10+ years and sometimes find it enlightening (and humorous) to reflect on them and also see how the themes have passed or evolved.

One that comes to mind...

Used to photograph every check I'd send in the mail to my landlord in case I randomly wrote something obscene on it, then also videotape myself placing the check in the envelope, sealing it, and placing it by the door away from a pen (in case I magically wrote something offensive and stashed it in the envelope before sealing, or on the outside before sending). Sometimes I would also tape myself taking it out and dropping it in the mailbox, ensuring I carefully captured all around the mailbox afterwards to prove it didn't magically fly out of the box.

Curious to hear other strange compulsions, if anyone would be open to sharing! I find it both entertaining and healing to see how our brains can be twisted so thoroughly. Best wishes to everyone, OCD sucks ass ❤️",1693945871,OCD

they mix but these two factors what's the most debilitated you have ever been by ocd?

well for me idk but maybe when i couldn't touch my family or there cloths and had to stand in specific places get dressed a certain way everything i did had rituals at the time

then there's the time i stopped doing online school for a week cause of fear of hell and stuff (cried myself to sleep some nights) and the other time i questioned everything like am i being controlled and have no free will and my thoughts aren't mine just a manipulation, obsession.

one that trails behind is that i had a evil spirit in me as a curse. 

iv THANKFULLY NEVER had a really really severe time where i couldn't sleep or get out of bed

3109,“OCD” comments on the pods,435,149ezyq,TheTryGuys,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTryGuys/comments/149ezyq/ocd_comments_on_the_pods/,97,"To start, I don’t want to come off as unreasonable with this post, and I am imagining the best intentions for everyone involved on the TryTeam! But I wanted to take a moment to offer some personal insight about the few comments that have come off as somewhat flippant referring to OCD on the podcasts that I recently noticed.

It’s been two times and while I don’t specifically remember where I heard the first one, the most recent was by Rachel on YCSWU this past Tuesday (6/13). As the group was talking about spring cleaning, Rachel was referring to a specific cleaning habit that she does so her home feels clean and habitable. I don’t know if Rachel has OCD, actually, so it’s possible that she does this as a genuine compulsion in response to a very distressing intrusive thought. But in the absence of that knowledge, to me, as a person with OCD, the comment comes across as rooted in the stereotype that people with OCD just want everything to be clean and in order.

Actually, OCD is not always that and it is one of the most debilitating mental illnesses according to the WHO. OCD takes a lot of shapes, but the key pieces are ongoing, repetitive, distressing intrusive thoughts and/or compulsive behaviors that are attempts to rid oneself of the disturbing thoughts and reduce anxiety. Sometimes, like for me, compulsions are all mental. I compulsively ruminate on my “theme” du jour, and I feel deeply anxious and depressed at the same time. Some people definitely do have cleaning compulsions, but it is in response to something so scary to that person that they feel deeply compelled to clean, otherwise they think/feel something as drastic as someone getting sick or dying could happen, as unreasonable as it sounds. (And it is pretty unreasonable. Most of the time we know it’s unreasonable, and that creates a lot of shame and self-loathing.) To sum up OCD as succinctly as possible, it’s a doubt disorder, and sufferers have a hard time tolerating the uncertainty inherent in life.

I can appreciate how hard it is to be a public figure at times, and anyone can say the wrong thing at the wrong time, but to say the least, I don’t appreciate stigmatizing language about my health condition. It takes the average person 10-14 years to receive an OCD diagnosis and start treatment, and that’s what happened to me. As a 20-something I actually spent the last 14+ years not understanding what was happening in my head. Joke-y comments about how you’re so OCD because you like to stack your books or whatever in a specific way perpetuated the idea that what I’m experiencing isn’t OCD and it makes it harder to reach treatment.

If you’d like to learn more about OCD, the International OCD Foundation is a good resource. I’ve finally found answers for myself by seeking care through NOCD, which is a mental healthcare app. I was connected to a therapist with expertise in OCD and how to treat it. They take most insurance in the United States (and some abroad I think) and they have payment plans for someone who doesn’t have insurance.

Background:My husband and I are both 27 and have been married for almost 3 years, no kids.

I have suffered with OCD for the majority of my life. I was officially diagnosed when I was 23 and finally got medication. The medication has greatly reduced my panic attacks, but it has also made me tired all the time.

My husband finds some of my OCD tics fascinating, which I don't blame him for, because I can see why he thinks that. I have talked to him about all my weirdest ones: the fact that I can't have my hands in the same position at the same time, the fact that I can't touch the mole on my neck or else I have compulsions to squeeze the skin, etc. (There are many more but those are most relevant.)

Sometimes, my husband induces my OCD to mess with me. Like if he's holding my hands and forces them into the same position to see how I'll react. I've talked to him about it and hes since stopped doing that.

Today, he playfully touched the mole on the back of my neck. I was like ""we talked about this; why do you trigger my OCD on purpose?""

He went on about how I need to overcome this anxiety and he was helping with my exposure to it. I told him he's not a licensed therapist and he's just stressing me out. I've gone to therapy. I see a psychiatrist frequently. I let the professionals handle that.

I was crying about how I feel he's disrespectful of my OCD by trying to induce those feeling's on purpose. He said that he's bothered that I'm giving in to irrational fears. 

Now I'm crying and trying to remove myself from the situation but he's keeps telling me it's just a mole and I need to act like people treat it in the real world. I KNOW that logically; I try to explain to him that OCD is illogical which is why I treat it with therapy and medication, and why I feel disrespected when he messes with it on purpose for no real reason.

Saw this shit on tiktok. Enraged me. I put up with the “IM sooo ocd!”  Shit constantly. This ruins my life. It is invasive. It is constant. It cannot be cured. I am tortured by intrusive thoughts, and pick at my skin for hours every night giving myself scars, and have panic attacks. And ya know what?  Thats best case scenario. 

BEST case scenario, I keep my floor clean otherwise my house will burn down and my family will be murdered.  I hate leaving the house because I hate my skin so much, my OCD convinces me that I am disgusting and nobody likes me, and that my life is a simulation. It gives me constant panic attacks. I fucking pull out my eyebrows. I can’t eat food because it’s “wrong” or “poisonous,” and then get upset and don’t eat. My brain is constant noise. And that’s the best I feel. I am dissociated 24/7, to the point where I call my friends and family crying and saying even if they weren’t real I’m glad I met them.  Guilt for awful things that I did not do but have convinced myself I have. I convince myself that people I case about are lying to me or cheating on me, disregarding the fact that I don’t surround myself with cheaters or liars. BEST case scenario. 

Worst case scenario, I wind up in a mental hospital because my fingers on my left hand stress me out and I will feel so much better after I cut them off. I ignore everyone because I dissociate so hard that I see no point.  I stop taking my meds and stop eating.  But the invasive thoughts and urges to hurt myself worsen. “If you don’t remove your femur you’ll have to amputate your leg.”  Its constantly fucking terrifying.  I get so desparate for any sort of way to make it stop.   Crippling guilt.  Paranoia of the world being a simulation or getting enraged because my family members were “put in this simulation” to “torture me and make me understand what I never will have or deserve.” OCD is torture.  It is a disability. It continues to make me miserable. 

Because it is a life long issue, I can only be in the best case scenario for so long before I hit rock bottom again.  People ask me why I get obsessed with things or do weird things. I can’t fucking control it.  I don’t want to be this weird. I didn’t ask to feel this way.  I don’t understand what I did. 

But by all means, straighten up your things, which you “have” to because you have such bad OCD. You’re so brave to keep fighting it!

Lmao time to continue my streak of crying myself to sleep, if I sleep at all!

Edit: thank you concerned strangers. I am no longer fully flipping my shit anymore, and am happy to report I am not psychotic. I pinky promise. It is just severe OCD. I have been evaluated more times than I care to say lmao. But this morning I am feeling better. I had a pretty deep spiral because of that one video, like any other emotionally stable individual. You guys are super sweet for caring so much, and I didn’t realized so many random strangers would take the time to write such thoughtful comments.  I feel obligated to clarify that I’m not being sarcastic, because I’m generally pretty sarcastic, but this is genuine. Y’all make me tear up <3

Edit 2: I am trying to get to everyone, but to anyone else with any sort of mental health issues, to ANY degree, I hope you can find some sort of relief <3

Edit 3: Thank you strangers for calling me a freak and telling me to kill myself. Very helpful.  Idk if theres more on this post or just my dms.

Edit 4:  In the comments someone described OCD as being like schizophrenia, except it’s you against your own mind. It breaks my heart to see how many people experience this.

Edit 5:  My friends, please don’t diminish your own mental health issues because you deem them not as severe as other people’s. Your struggles are valid. Full stop. That’s it.  Any mental illness to any severity is awful.

My wife  is the child of doctors and she's had these rules forever. these are the rules she grew up with as well. the rules don't bother me but my own parents (not doctors) have insisted that it leans more into OCD. I enjoy the rules as they make sense to me but I want an outside perspective.

These are some of the things she does:

 \- She does not share water bottles, drinks or food with others, except for me and our kids

\- handwashing upon returning from outside (but she doesn't enforce it for guests) and handwashing before eating, anywhere. so if we're in a restaurant, she'll get up and wash her hands before eating. she will use hand sanitizer if it's available.

\- no touching face outside of the home- Devices and anything that has been outdoors are subject to sanitization. if she touches an ""outside"" item at home, such as her purse, she'll wash her hands

\- She strictly enforces a ""no outdoor shoes indoors"" policy, even for guests. if someone walks in with shoes, she'll wash the floor afterwards, but only with soapy water and a mop.

\- When our kids were infants, she insisted on handwashing before anyone could hold them.- She prohibited anyone from kissing our babies on their hands or faces.

\- In hotel rooms, she thoroughly sanitizes surfaces, including the toilet seat.- She refrains from walking barefoot inside hotel rooms.

\- she has taught our kids how to use public bathrooms without touching anything... ie, closing the door with a paper towel, flushing with foot, closing faucet with paper towel

I checked on them, they seemed OK, I apologized, they told me their name, I stayed a moment, then left.

Now my mind has flashed back to the that night convinced that the person died, that I should have called an ambulance (even though they seemed fine), that I'm a murderer.

I spent the past 2 days crying, throwing up, screaming. I couldn't eat, I could barely sleep, convinced I was a killer. Even though this incident occurred over six years ago, it's only now that it's bothering me.

I resisted going to the ER for as long as I could, as I was terrified they would put me in a psychiatric hold. But the distress just got too much, and I got my husband to take me.

I checked in at the front desk, weeping, telling them I had OCD, anxiety and exhaustion. They took my vitals, then I had to wait for hours and hours until they finally got me into a bed. I wept with shame as I had to put on the hospital gown. How could I let this happen?

After lots more waiting, eventually they ended up giving me saline to get some fluids in me, then some Ativan. I spoke to their psychiatric team, who said it probably didn't seem like I needed to be kept in, and then I was free to go. I'm expecting a bill of thousands, but I don't care about that.

Today, I got a prescription for Ativan, a short supply. I also have started working with a NOCD specialist who I'm hoping will help me to work things out.

As it is, right now I feel extremely scared, more so than I have in my entire life. I'm just trying to take things day by day.

I would give anything to know for certain that I did not kill that person I hit with my bike. But maybe I'll just have to live with the uncertainty that I'll never know.

Before we had a baby we talked about his limitations and we decided we could handle them. For example he cannot change diapers, he tried and it did not end well. 

We also decided I would be a stay at home mom and he would work since he makes three times the amount of money I make. 

We fought today because I asked him to watch the baby (between me feeding the baby and holding the baby during his naps every two hours) so I could pack because the baby and I leave tomorrow for a week at my parents house. 

He lasted less than two hours. He brought the baby to me and told me he cannot stand the crying, it makes him hate the baby and it's my job as the primary care giver to calm the baby down. 

Our baby is almost five months old and I'm absolutely exhausted. I breast fed until a week ago, now I exclusively pump. The baby and I sleep in a different room together so my husband can get the amount of sleep he needs for work. While my husband takes care of us financially, does a lot of the chores around the house, and will cook for me, I resent the fact that he won't spend more than ten minutes with the baby at a time and I resent that he has limitations. 

He tells me he needs time to himself and that the baby crying makes him hate the baby and he just can't do it. I don't know if it's the OCD or if he just doesn't want to be around our baby but I can't do it anymore without help. 

Any advice on staying strong and fighting through the exhaustion would be appreciated.

3187,2.01 Trauma Drama Tips and Pics,13,172myyg,cyberpunkgame,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/172myyg,16,"Each run can be somewhat long and tedious, so I'm hoping these tips can help people save some time. Please comment your own tips as well or correct me if I'm wrong about something.

**General tips**: 

Most likely, you can die only twice, three times if you manage to not miss many points. You gain 10 points per non-kill hit, so using weapons with lower per-hit damage nets more points (not worth dying for though). The ""G"" drop gives the same points as a one-hit kill. You can shoot directly below you by jumping and then shooting downward. Hitting and destroying explosives gives points. Shooting and destroying helicopters gives points, and most helicopters will fly away after a short amount of time. When you get an ""A"" drop or two of the same weapon drops, it upgrades your weapon. You can pause the game and assess if you want to.

**Level Tips**:

**Sword boss**: Don't stand in the middle when the boss is zooming left and right unless you know when he will stop (I think it's 4 or 5 times).

**The �� level with endless enemies**: It can be safer to take out ground enemies before shooting the helicopters. I believe some or all of the enemies that come from the helicopters can stop spawning after killing a certain amount of them.

**Jumping and glass drop boss**: I believe the falling glass can be walked into right after the shatter animation. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

**Tank boss**: The bottom platform is the safest spot (where the female enemy spawns on the left side). If you go to the far right of the bottom, you can shoot the helicopter and the enemies it spawns. You may also be able to damage the tank from this spot if you shoot at the right angle with the right weapon (I've only tried ""M"" and ""LM""). The tank will reverse before zooming left, and once it passes the screen, it will appear from the right side.

3190,YSK: “Trauma bonding” doesn’t mean bonding over shared trauma,7510,13mr03r,YouShouldKnow,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/13mr03r/ysk_trauma_bonding_doesnt_mean_bonding_over/,255,"Why YSK: A lot of people use the term “trauma bonding” to mean a bond shared by two (or more) people bonding over shared trauma, or becoming close by talking about trauma together. While this makes intuitive sense, the term actually refers to the bond between an abused person and their abuser.

When someone is abused, they may have a psychological trauma response that results in a trauma bond. This is usually caused by an unhealthy attachment, the victim feeling dependent on the abuser, feeling sympathy for the abuser, or the cycle of abuse and positive reinforcement (“I’m sorry, I won’t do it again, you know I love you, right?”).

This typically manifests as the victim excusing/justifying the abuser’s behaviour, isolating themselves to hide the abuse from outsiders, maintaining hope that the relationship/the abuser’s behaviour will improve, and feeling unable or unwilling to leave despite detriments to the victim’s mental/physical health and wellbeing. Victims also may equate abuse with love and not recognise abusive behaviours as abuse (because “they still love me” or “they’re doing it because they care”).

Many victims of abuse who form a trauma bond with their abuser find it particularly hard to leave the relationship/remove the abuser from their life, can suffer intense distress when they do leave, and are more likely than non-trauma bonded victims to return to their abuser.

Edit: Removed an inaccurate sentence

Edit 2: A lot of people have mentioned Stockholm Syndrome in the comments and the sentence I removed actually talked about how Stockholm Syndrome is a form of trauma bond. I removed it because a commenter let me know that the validity of Stockholm Syndrome is controversial and I didn’t want the post to include anything inaccurate. I don’t know enough about Stockholm Syndrome to speak on it myself or make a call whether it’s accurate or not so I just removed it, but yes, trauma bonding does look very similar to the idea behind Stockholm Syndrome.

Edit 3: A lot of people have been asking for what the term would be as described in the title (bonding over shared trauma). While no one’s found a completely accurate term, u/magobblie suggested “stress bonding” to describe this, which seems about right, though it’s specific to creating a bond between rabbits who huddle together when exposed to a common stressor.",1684586617,trauma

[**Was I wrong to do this?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/11l8rc2/was_i_wrong_to_do_this/) \- 7 March 2023

Some context: Been with this family 6 months. I usually work 2-8 PM. Kiddo is 5 years old and in school. She doesn’t nap when I’m there and I leave when she goes to bed.

Sunday night, I was doing a date night for the parents. Put Kiddo to bed at usual bedtime and retired downstairs to watch TV. About an hour later, I hear crying and Kiddo calling for me. I head upstairs and she’s very upset. I’m pretty sure she had a bad dream, but couldn’t vocalize it well. She asked me to stay with her and I agreed.

This is potentially where I messed up. I laid beside her and stroked her hair, rubbed her back, etc. in attempt to help her settle.

The parents returned 15 minutes later. The dad was very upset when he came in the room and asked why I was in the bed. By this time, I had gotten up and the mom was laying in the bed. I explained she had a nightmare and had asked me to lay with her. He didn’t say anything else and I didn’t think much of it after that, figuring he understood. I was paid and left.

Monday morning, Mom Boss texted me that Kiddo was sick so I didn’t have to come in. Figured that might explain her waking up.

This morning, Dad Boss called me and said that they were very “disturbed” to find me laying in bed. He said it was very inappropriate. I could barely get a word in when I was informed I would have the rest of the week off with pay while they “debated my future with their family.”

This is my first nanny job. I honestly thought this was okay. Was I wrong?

Edit to clarify: I am not being accused of anything. Dad Boss has stressed he does not believe I hurt Nanny Kid, rather it was still inappropriate and crossed a boundary.

[Comment thread on what has upset Dad Boss:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/11l8rc2/comment/jbc2tcf/)

**Redditor:** It’s okay for parents to have a boundary of no laying in bed with Nanny Kid. It’s not okay for them to never voice this boundary and then suspend/potentially fire you over it. There are so many nuanced situations in this line of work that some people would view as inappropriate and others wouldn’t think twice about. What your Nanny Family should have done is say something like “in the future we are not comfortable with you laying in bed with Nanny Kid” and that’s that. If they don’t believe you harmed Nanny Kid, and you had no idea this was inappropriate to them, what is there to debate? Your best move is probably to start searching for a new family. So sorry this happened to you!

**OP:** From what I understand, Dad Boss feels I made a bad judgement call and is now calling my decision making skills into account. In his mind, this is just common sense and even if it were innocent, I should have known better.

As I type it out, it really makes no sense.

 

[**Update to “was I wrong to do this”**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/11m3o5b/update_to_was_i_wrong_to_do_this/) \- 8 March 2023

So, I had my Skype with Nanny Parents about an hour ago and I feel like I had whiplash. Started great and ended terribly.

As soon as I answered, Mom Boss said “Tell us your side.” I did, explaining I felt this was the best way to comfort Nanny Kid. I added that I understand it’s a boundary and I won’t do it again, but all boundaries need to be made clear to me. I said I spoke with a group of fellow nannies who both agreed it’s not common sense but also that the boundary wasn’t unreasonable. It's just that they need to communicate this to me as well as how to handle this should it happen again.

They seemed receptive. Dad Boss explained why he acted the way he did and I won’t get into it here but it is trauma based. He reiterated he doesn’t think I did anything to 5F, they love me, they appreciate me, etc. We came up with a plan on what to do should it happen again (I’ll sit in a chair by Nanny Kid’s bed). At this point, I was thinking maybe we could turn it around. I know many of you said just quit, but I wanted to try to avoid that.

Well, then the call got awkward. I thought the conversation was done once they laid out their boundaries. But Dad Boss kept talking and kept questioning if it really wasn’t common sense. He implied that he felt I was gaslighting him, not with those words but more of “I don’t think I’m wrong to feel this way and I don’t appreciate you trying to change the narrative.” I stressed several times that I don’t think his boundary is wrong, but how he went about it was.

This lead to a discussion of cameras. I’m their first nanny so they asked my opinion upon hiring. I said I’d work with them if they really felt needed but I just find them awkward and like I can’t truly be myself. At the time, they agreed against it. But now, Dad Boss wants to put cameras up in every room until I “rebuild trust.” It was a complete 180 from his previous “We love you!” speech.

I said that hurt. He said how am I supposed to trust you when you haven’t apologized. For fricking what?!

Finally, I said I can’t work somewhere where I’m not trusted and I can’t risk them falsely accusing me of something. Mom Boss got very upset and tried to apologize on behalf of her husband. I said no. Another 5 awkward minutes of settling out particulars (mailing back their keys and such, them paying me severance as they declined me serving a 2 weeks notice).

It sucks because I love Nanny Kid and I won’t get to say goodbye. But y’all were right. His fears are based in trauma and I get it... but if they’re this bad, he needs therapy. Anyway, thanks for all the advice. I tried to get back to everyone but there was a lot, haha.

[Comment thread offering insight on the dynamic between Dad and Mom Boss:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/11m3o5b/comment/jbhnzvl/)

**Redditor:** I know people who won't leave their kids with nannies or individual babysitters because they themselves were abused by babysitters (non-family or family) and have trauma as a result. I understand that. But having this trauma, hiring a nanny and then dumping it on the nanny's head is Not OK. Sounds as though the family needs some therapy... and maybe to reconsider using nannies at all. Glad you got out of there, and good luck finding a family that's a better fit.

**OP:** This is also what I don’t really understand. Mom Boss did always imply that she was the one who wanted to get a nanny but I never thought Dad Boss was resentful in anyway? All of this sort of came out of left field.

No one can even come close to imagining what their response would be in that moment of utter terror and confusion, not to mention she was likely under the influence of alcohol and possibly drugs of some kind. That is a massive swirl of complicated emotions and responses...

Confusion. Fear. Terror. Concern for her roommates, concern for herself. Doubt for what she was hearing and seeing. It is likely anyone would shut down and lock themselves away. Depending on how drunk she is, she could have fallen asleep hiding in her closet or under her bed terrified to make a sound, waiting to be sure he was gone before she called 911.

Additionally, no one knows what she is experiencing NOW and she is likely very traumatized, grieving, and guilty about her very natural response. Wondering how she was spared. I feel like the public coming at her will only make her feel a million times worse.

I wish people would stop pretending like there is a normal response to what she experienced that night.",1672940481,trauma

In S1E25, ""Pascal's Triangle Revisited"", Britta is having her last mandatory therapy session with Duncan, and at minute 3:20, he says: ""Now, look, there are bugs on the windshield of your mind you may never be able to squeegee, like a certain birthday party attended by a rather enterprising transient in a dinosaur costume.""

Britta makes a face when he says this. I don't ever remember hearing him say this before, and it made me think of the other clues throughout the series:

In S3E19, ""Curriculum Unavailable"", when the ""therapist"" is listing everyone's trauma to convince them they were all in an asylum, at minute 15: 16 when he gets to Britta she says ""Enough! I don't want to hear mine.""

Later in the same season, in ""Intro to Finality"", when she's trying to ""therapize"" Evil Abed and he turns the session around on her, at minute 9:35 we enter the middle of a conversation where Evil Abed says ""-And what was he wearing?"" Shaken, Britta says: ""He was dressed as a dinosaur."" 

A network television show would probably never outright say it(or at least the network executives wouldn't let it be said on their comedy show), but aren't we supposed to conclude that Britta was molested/sexually assaulted by someone at hers or someone else's birthday party? My guess is that, when Britta's parents were a lot worse and on drugs when she was younger, they hired someone who they thought was a legitimate party entertainer, but turned out to be a druggie or shady vagrant to work at her birthday party, and some dark things happened.

Does anybody else have any thoughts on this? Or any other clues that might have appeared throughout the series?",1697839206,trauma

3265,Psychology lecturer (who's also a therapist) told me today that developmental trauma/ C-PTSD is "not trauma".,963,13xl5cc,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/13xl5cc/psychology_lecturer_whos_also_a_therapist_told_me/,310,"And it sums up everything I hate about this system; as a survivor and as a student.   
He said ""Only directly psychically life-threatening events are trauma.""  
I told him that what he means is **shock**trauma. He continued with that he doesn't like to call developmental trauma/ C-PTSD ""trauma"", because he doesn't want the term trauma™ to be ""diluted with something else that isn't trauma"".  
After it took me 25 years to even find out that I am deeply f\*cking traumatized and even more years to actually acknowledge my complex trauma, this feels so god damn invalidating.- Although I didn't expect anything else from a kognitive behavioural therapist *and* lecturer at my university, that doesn't teach anything about C-PTSD.  


Edit:   
One further highlight was when he spoke about the causes and mechanisms of maintenance of schizophrenia.  
He literally said: ""Trauma can cause schizophrenia, BUT in therapy we don't focus on that because it's in the past and we can't change the past anyway.""  
As soon as I am giving my presentation, I'm prepared to tell the course: ""Saying trauma is irrelevant because it 'lays in the past' is like telling a patient with a broken leg: 'The act of your leg being broken lays in the past, so we can't do anything about this. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯ Your CURRENT problems are pain and problems with walking. So what our therapy offers is giving you painkillers and teaching you how to walk.' Instead of treating that fucking broken leg.""  
(Schizophrenia is the topic of this course and I willingly choose it, assuming it would be less triggering for me to see the typical invalidation of C-PTSD here than in other courses like depression or anxiety, since schizophrenia at least seems to have some kind of biological background.)",1685634697,trauma

Two months ago, I was robbed. The perpetrator must have been at the bank at the same time as me because I withdrew $1500 and put the bank envelope in my bag. (I was going straight to my friend who I was paying for working on my house). After I had left, I was walking to my car which was at the local library parking garage. When I entered the garage, someone ran up from behind me and grabbed my bag off my shoulder. I tried running after them but my outfit was not suited for a chase. A few blocks down, I found my bag laying on the ground, but the envelope was gone. So far, no progress has been made finding the guy (no one was hurt so I don’t think the police are making it a priority) and though I wasn’t robbed at gunpoint or anything like that, it was still traumatic.

The other day, I confided in my fiancé that I am carrying a lot of anger surrounding the situation. I know life is not fair but I can’t get over someone praying on me and getting no repercussions. Especially because I’ve always had to work hard for everything I have. He was kind and told me to focus on gratitude, I still had money to pay my mortgage, car, and groceries. He told me getting caught up in a victim mentality will only hurt me worse. I agreed and mentioned that I scheduled with a therapist the following week to help me deal with the feelings. I felt good after our talk.

The next day, it was a weekend; we needed to clean the house for an event and I also wanted to work on the laundry room renovation I’ve been doing for the last month. As I was talking about the strategy I’ve been using to get the laundry room done, my fiancé was saying I should do it a different way. I said “it’s been working for me so far.” (He hadn’t helped with the project at all at this point). But he wouldn’t let it go. I got frustrated and said “well I’ll clean the house for our guests and you can work on the laundry room, that way you can do it your way.” Ultimately I don’t care “how” it gets done, as long as it gets done. He response with “there you go with that victim mentality again.” 

I was so thrown off and immediately told him it was really messed up for him to use something I told him in confidence because he’s frustrated with me. He didn’t let up, he said “I’ve noticed you have a victim mentality for a lot of things and it’s not right.” I responded “I am getting extremely angry and I am not willing to have this conversation with you.” He lost it, he started yelling at me that he can’t stand someone who can’t take criticism and I was wrong for just shutting down the conversation. I told him I wasn’t going to sit quietly while he belittles me and I left the house for a few hours. 

He didn’t speak to me at all the rest of the day, then he went to his parents house (this was preplanned, his dad is having a minor surgery and he planned to stay there a week to help his mom deal with his recovery). He left two days ago and I haven’t heard from him at all. 

Am I being overdramatic to consider leaving him over this?

Edit: Thank you for the thoughtful opinions, I definitely have a lot to think about. I am going to give the ring back and let him know at the very least, we need make sure we are compatible in how we support one another before considering marriage. Some people mentioned he could be stressed about his dad’s surgery and maybe he’s not handling things well so I’m going to suggest he go to therapy also. I was going to therapy mainly to discuss the robbery but I realize I need to speak honestly about my relationship with a professional before I consider marriage. I didn’t have great relationship models growing up so I may be in a toxic situation without realizing how bad it is.",1693239871,trauma

Mostly just sharing my experience but advice on bruxism welcome.

I recently attended a dental appt due to severe bruxism (teeth grinding) and the dentist went straight into a lecture about drug use, healthy habits, reducing stress etc upon seeing my teeth. 

I responded by stating I know that I grind my teeth, that’s why I’m here, I can’t help it, I need sedatives to sleep so cannot be 100% sober, and I am seeking mitigation/support from a dental point of view. 

She wouldn’t let up and kept making remarks about exercise, drinking water, sober life (I am visually very healthy so very out of left field to assume I don’t do at least two of those things). She also made a comment about how if I keep up with the teeth grinding I would need several root canals within the month (I’m 25). 

I burst into tears at that, and she seemed very confused. I then advised her that I have CPTSD, a diagnosed stress disorder for which I see numerous medical professionals, and that reducing stress for me is not as simple as a LITERAL walk in the park and I don’t appreciate the condescension and comments about my lifestyle. 

Her entire tone then changed, and she started to treat me like a baby, advising me of when and how she was going to touch me etc (she obviously thought CSA but I was neglected as opposed to abused, so another wrong assumption from her).

I was really put off by what seemed to be her *suddenly remembering* that she’s supposed to be a trauma-informed clinician, and switching the energy around 180°. If she were really trauma informed, would she not comprehend that bruxism is a really common symptom of a trauma-caused illness and behave with a little kindness?",1693900729,trauma

When the cops arrived they first approach and talk to the group and when the cops approached us I thought he was gonna ask us what happened but he instead told me and my brother to apologise to the drunk dude and shake hands, I was in disbelief because we are the ones who asked to call them and they didn't even asked us what happened. Then I told the cop that the drunk dude damaged my car then the cop asked me whether we settle it there or the police station then I told the cop to settle at the station. (We tried to tell the cops our side but I think he didn't believe us)

When we arrived at the station we went to the investigators room and settle there. (Even tried to tell other cops at the station but didn't seem to believe us either)

But when I got home I decided to search the drunk dude on Facebook and saw that his age and job was not a match on the one written in the report/kasunduan.  ( Written in there was the guy was unemployed but apparently he is a seaman and works for NCL)

I think the cops just wants to get over with it and finish the case.

Update: this all happened last Tuesday and the case has already been settled. We are under pressured at that time because the police are insisting to settle na lang because  they reiterate na lalaki lang daw yung case.

We also found out recently that 4 police from the station knew the drunk guy, and they all came from the same town.

That is the main reason why the police intentionally manipulated some information as to the age, occupation and even the correct spelling of drunk guy's surname.

I will talk about Boneshatter only tangently, but this post is mostly about Trauma support. I do hope you will leave this post understanding why, no, Frostbreath is not INSANE with Trauma support, nor BIS, nor anything, and why it's actually a lot more niche than you could have expected (EDIT: For clarification, the thing I think is a lot more niche is Trauma support, not frostbreath).

&#x200B;

So. First things first, a topic which may seem completely out of the subject: Double dipping. I'm pretty sure if I ask you guys example of double dipping, you will answer me stuff such as ""Non-chaos damage as chaos while converting"" or ""Wilma with buffs giving cast speed and attack speed on separate lines"". Ok. That's not what double dipping is. Double dipping is not about gaining twice the stuff by gaining a stat. Double dipping is about gaining a QUADRATIC SCALING by gaining a single stat. That mean, if I get 100% more of something, I get 4 times the dps.

&#x200B;

Double dipping mechanics are extremely rare. The most famous case was ailments pre 3.0, where gaining chaos damage was increased the damage of a hit doing chaos damage, and also increasing again, multiplicatively, the poison damage done. It means that chaos damage had a quadratic effect on poison damage. Almost all of it got removed from the game.

&#x200B;

Yes, almost. Currently, there is a single mechanic in the game which truly double dip: Trauma.

&#x200B;

Trauma, both Boneshatter and trauma support, have a quadratic scaling on ATTACK SPEED (and I put that in cap because if you have to remember one thing, remember this). It means, when you are doing a trauma support build, if you really intend to scale it, the most important stat is the attack speed, period. Boneshatter is also in such a case, but can be used """"""normally"""""" because the base skill is that insane, even if you don't stack it too much. But Divergent Boneshatter is actually closer to a CUBIC scaling but even better (Attack speed means more attacks, more attack speed and more damage), hence why delvers are using it to destroy deep delves, and it's compensated by a fairly long ramp up time, making it less appealing for general mapping (I mean the mega stacking boneshatter build, not the one where you cap at like 30 stacks). Anyway, this post is not about Boneshatter, because I'm not sure I can properly explain the maths behind the tipping points where you instant move from 1XX trauma stacks max to 30,30 attacks/s with 600 max stacks just because you added a buff.

&#x200B;

Back to Trauma Support. I said it had a quadratic scaling on attack speed. To understand what it means, let's take an example. We have a weapon with 0 base damage, 1 APS, 0% more damage, and the trauma support is adding 1 added damage to attacks per stack.

&#x200B;

[By varying the amount of increased attack speed, we have the following result:](https://preview.redd.it/gyzz92z72qib1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=9624825883336d486d488be1ca86972da6626ae4)

""Alright, I get it, doubling the attack speed means doing 4x the damage. That's cool. I guess it means I should focus everything on increased attack speed, then!""

Well, yes, but not quite. First, repeat after me: ""SPEED IS KING"". While it's true, the result goes much, much, much deeper than a paltry scaling on increased attack speed. While the example is about increased attack speed, it's not ONLY about increased attack speed. It's also about More attack speed.

&#x200B;

[Example with Ancestral Protector](https://preview.redd.it/hr6t4rne2qib1.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe7f27c08f0b24dc736a8468a962a230a7a52a32)

As you can see, more attack speed are having a squared effect as well. Meaning if you truly intend to stack traumas, more attack speed buffs such as Berserk (73% more damage), ancestral protector (44% more damage), Blitz (96% more damage), Arena Challenger (44% more damage) are extremely important to scale your damage if you can actually include them in your build. Up to a certain point: You are still capped to 30.30 APS max, so having too much attack speed just doesn't do anything anymore at some point. But if you can reach this point, you probably understood what i'm writing anyway and know about the cap anyway.

# SPEED IS KING.

The thing is.... If you put the mouse on the ""more attack speed"" cell in pob, you will notice something...

[For instance, Flicker Strike](https://preview.redd.it/q9885uhh2qib1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c40bcce50684e27e131e6653941b2ce107c7176)

As you can see, Flicker strike has a ""20% more attack speed"" in POB. It's not coming from nowhere, it's the attack speed modifier of the skill. And it's another extremely important part of scaling trauma support properly.

If I use the same weapon, with the same stats, but use two skills with two different base attack speed, the result will be vastly different.

For instance, let's say I compare Vigilant Strike to Flicker strike. For the example, I don't have charges for either skills, but I consider they don't have CD.

If I don't put Trauma support, Vigilant strike has a damage effectiveness of 350% with an attack speed modifier of 0.85, (so a base dps of 297.5% of weapon dps). Flicker, on the other hand, has an attack speed modifier of 1.2 for a damage effectiveness of 210% (So a base DPS of 252%, which is lower).

&#x200B;

But what if we plug Trauma support in these skills with the example weapon? Well, we get this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kzimqg6j2qib1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=138c518bf09bb43a2f7a612387cca35818cde15d

So yes, Flicker wins by a fairly good amount, because with trauma support, SPEED IS KING.

Note it also works in reverse. Melee Physical damage support, with its 10% less attack speed, has actually a 19% less dps added to it due to that. Even the awakened MPD (+ intimidate) barely beats ""simple"" supports such as ruthless in a trauma stacking scenario.

And... It doesn't stop there. It's not only the skills, but obviously... The weapons. Many people argued that Frostbreath is by far the best weapon for trauma support because of the double damage. You may have seen me answering to them, and you will know what I will do next. But... when I say the attack speed is everything to trauma support, I do mean that. Frostbreath is not a particularly bad weapon, and scale decently well with trauma support... But the incontested champion of Trauma support is Brightbeak, because, once again, SPEED IS KING.

&#x200B;

[Comparaison between Frostbreath and Brightbeak using the previous examples conditions.](https://preview.redd.it/hvhrdvhk2qib1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b7ab5bcdfa77c9b7f39b45504ba905c3325b186)

As you can see, it's not a contest, Brightbeak is the peak weapon here, and on top of that, will offer you a much better confort while playing (more attack speed, no need to hit once before getting double damage, etc etc). It's just because you are basically comparing 1.45 \* 1.45 \* 2 = 4.2  (for frostbreath) to 2.2\*2.2\*1 = 4.84 (for brightbeak). **You will also notice that the ramp up time hasn't changed (same duration on both). It's not because brightbeak reach a higher amount of stack that you need more time to reach it. Being capped at 30 stacks doesn't mean your ramp up time is quicker than 50 stacks. It's the same.**

SPEED IS KING. For trauma support, if you truly intend to scale it for real, you need three things: As much attack speed as you can, a decent increased damage because at some point, if you are lacking too much, it beats even a quadratic scaling stat, and....

&#x200B;

# SPEED IS KING UP TO A CERTAIN POINT: Multistrike

&#x200B;

Yeah, I saw multiple people suggesting using trauma support with multistrike. Don't:

&#x200B;

[Only base damage will save you. Trauma support won't.](https://preview.redd.it/qnlimf2ydqib1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=aadae94867e926cff71917acfbf8784c659f3e3a)

It's absolutely terrible. Either swap out trauma or Multistrike, but never ever use both. Multistrike is the only case where ""More attack speed"" is not enough to make it good. Obviously, fatal flourish is even worse.

&#x200B;

# THE COUNTERPOINT TO SPEED IS KING:

&#x200B;

I guess it will not have escaped the notice of some people that I ""forgot"" to talk about a very important point so far: The self damage. For trauma support, Speed is king up to a certain point, the point where you can't handle the self damage.

&#x200B;

[Because the self damage has quadratic scaling on attack speed, same as DPS.](https://preview.redd.it/cup3nsoq2qib1.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=8811cb04145bca80da59643fec60557e4f8e636f)

And the previous points are all true as well. Ancestral protector (44% more self damage), Blitz (96% more self damage), Arena Challenger (44% more self damage), Berserk... Well, not berserk, because it's cheating (73% more damage for 20% more self damage). And same for the skills and the base attack speed on weapons.

I'm not going to move into an explanation of armour, but basically, the more damage you take, the exponentially more armour you need. While it's realistic to use armour to tank 30-50 stacks, it's not if you intend to reach 200 trauma stacks like one of my flicker strike trauma slayer pob. And to reach this amount, you will need to find a way to get at least 70%, if not outright 90% PDR with 0 armour.

Meaning the following: If you just intent to plug in Trauma support and play with like 15-20 stacks of trauma, using it as utility to trigger CWDT and such while being a okay tier support gem, it's fine, but you are not using the support at full potential. And it's not a problem. If you can't handle a lot of trauma, it's fine to remove one of these more attack speed multiplier (by using a slower skill, a slower weapon, or something else). And that's the point I want to make: Frostbreath is a good entry level weapon if you are too squishy to really dive into trauma stacking. But using the trauma support at its full potential? A BIS? Not. Even. Close. Only case I could see Frostbreath being BIS is if we can reach 30,30 AS with it despite the low speed. We would need an alternate quality on the support similar to the one on boneshatter (And I honestly doubt it will be the case).

Outside of that, Frostbreath Trauma support is for squishy characters who aren't built around trauma support stacking. And it's not an issue, Trauma support is complicated to build around if you truly want to stack a triple digit amount of stacks (and you are basically locked in Jugg or Slayer unless you have multiple mirrors to throw at your character).

However, at some point, if the amount of trauma is not really high, you should really ask yourself if it's the proper support. Do I actually get more damage by using this support over using another one? What happen if I take a weapon with high pdps instead of a fast weapon/frostbreath? Is my PDR investment not too high for the returns I get from Trauma support? These are the questions you should really ask yourself if you are hovering below 25 stacks.

&#x200B;

Final things: Some people will throw PoBs at me telling me how wrong I am, look at it, Frostbreath is doing better than Brightbeak with Trauma support. Don't, I really don't care to check your pob. I just know one of the few next things is happening:

\- Unlike the example, Frostbreath (usually with glacial hammer) has a higher base damage than Brightbeak, and thus, the actual scaling from trauma support hasn't settled in. The pob you will show me will have a low amount of stacks (usually around 25 for Frostbreath, because higher, Brightbeak beats it handily even with the handicap of base damage), and the point you will be trying to prove will be the exact opposite of the point you are actually proving: Frostbreath beats Brightbeak the lower amount of stack you have, meaning it's not trauma support which is giving a good scaling to the weapon.

\- Or, more likely, it's people who plug in both weapons without changing the amount of stacks, or by giving an unfair advantage to frostbreath (such as AS corruption, while forgetting doing the same to brightbeak).

\- However, if you do manage to do the hypothetical example of a frostbreath with 30.30 APS without multistrike, go ahead, show it, I AM interested!

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading up to this point, I hope you learned something!

&#x200B;

Edit: A point I forgot to make is the fact you are not stuck to leveling trauma support either. Same as divergent boneshatter is usually played lvl 8, a lvl 5-15 trauma support may add a more sustainable amount of self damage for a reduced amount of added damage, but still at your advantage. You will have to check if 30 traumas at lvl 20 is better than, for instance, 40 trauma lvl 15 and how much damage you take in both cases.",1692300720,trauma

""He's just escaping his crimes, he's not actually repenting""

""Why'd they have to make dottore the real evil villain behind everything?""

""He's a good guy now""

These critics all miss the point of Inversion of Genesis, and Scaramouche in general.

Inversion of Genesis, primarily, is a story about how trauma disrupts the internal story of people in a way that they fail to create proper structures for which to engage with life. It's also a story about the perfect suicide, and why even that isn't good.

You also have to understand Scaramouche. He's primarily emotional, but views it as a terrible thing due to the ways he's been hurt in the past. Despite that, he physically cannot stop himself from caring, and his goal has always been suicide, although not the suicide as we know it. You see, when Traveler warns Scaramouche that the process of turning him into a god will destroy him, he's not seeing that as a bad thing, it's one of the perks. He's tired of feeling because the world has always punished him for having feelings. Whether it's Ei (yes, she's at fault), Dottore, the Fatui in general, trauma has defined him and has ruined his ability to create a healthy story to define himself. He is a shell filled with the one thing he hates, which is why he turns that pain on everyone else in order to punish them, too.

Some people may read this and go ""That isn't an excuse for his evil deeds. He still made the choice to do evil.""

1. That's not what the story is about, and you're reading it wrong if you think it is.
2. The story refutes this anyways

Scaramouche, after failing to commit suicide once, is arguably at his lowest, at least in the game. He's a prisoner held under Nahida, he lacks his divine power and support from the Fatui. This is the catalyst that leads into his second suicide attempt. When he learns that Dottore was the person responsible for Tatarasuna, his worldview instantly shifts. No longer can he say that the world punished him for having emotions, because it didn't. Yet, despite this, he doesn't immediately fly in a rage to avenge Niwa and try to kill Dottore. He instead sacrifices himself, thinking that removing himself from history will allow his friends to live full, happy lives. This is the deepest insight into who Scaramouche is as a person. He is a caring person who was forced by the world to be cold and abrasive. He has to look for excuses to care, namely ""value exchanges"". That's why, in spite of all his evil deeds, it's impossible to call him purely evil.

Wanderer is what happens when Scaramouche is erased from reality, and the trauma that defined him doesn't exist. He is aimless, helpful, empathetic. He bears no guilt or shame. Despite this, he still desires the truth. Why? Well, it's because he needs to learn to integrate the trauma back into him. His brief time as ""Wanderer"" reminds him of the worldview that made him happy, yet he still needs to synthesize the worldviews. Suicide can't help him, he realizes that now. Thus, the only option is to live. To live is to suffer with the unbearable guilt that he can no longer rationalize away. To live is to open himself up to a thousand more cuts and pains. Yet it's clear that living is the only thing that he can do. It's the only thing we can do.

With Nahida by his side and a new community of people who value him, Wanderer can start to rebuild his fractured mind, and remove the story that Dottore and Ei's trauma forced upon him. He is a man whose principles are at odds from his personality, and the dissonance between the two caused him great pain. Now he has the option to change his principles to his personality. He is not guiltless- quite the opposite, in fact. He alone bears the guilt of what happened in Inazuma. He will allow anyone to bear their own vengeance upon him if they so desire, but it helps no one to do that.

To put it simply, to talk about Inversion of Genesis as though it is about Justice is a misread of the story. That's not what the story is about, though it does touch on those concepts. Inversion of genesis is well written and Scaramouche has an intricate characterization that is sadly lacking in most of Genshin's cast, though I understand why that is.

3370,Trauma support and You: Understanding the Trauma Mechanic.,155,15twwrc,PathOfExileBuilds,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/15twwrc/trauma_support_and_you_understanding_the_trauma/,148,"Alright, I'm doing this post because there is a lot of misconception, bias, and in general errors about the Trauma support, and in general the trauma mechanic. I will talk about Boneshatter only tangently, but this post is mostly about Trauma support. I do hope you will leave this post understanding why, no, Frostbreath is not INSANE with Trauma support, nor BIS, nor anything, and why it's actually a lot more niche than you could have expected (EDIT: For clarification, the thing I think is a lot more niche is Trauma support, not frostbreath).

&#x200B;

So. First things first, a topic which may seem completely out of the subject: Double dipping. I'm pretty sure if I ask you guys example of double dipping, you will answer me stuff such as ""Non-chaos damage as chaos while converting"" or ""Wilma with buffs giving cast speed and attack speed on separate lines"". Ok. That's not what double dipping is. Double dipping is not about gaining twice the stuff by gaining a stat. Double dipping is about gaining a QUADRATIC SCALING by gaining a single stat. That mean, if I get 100% more of something, I get 4 times the dps.

&#x200B;

Double dipping mechanics are extremely rare. The most famous case was ailments pre 3.0, where gaining chaos damage was increased the damage of a hit doing chaos damage, and also increasing again, multiplicatively, the poison damage done. It means that chaos damage had a quadratic effect on poison damage. Almost all of it got removed from the game.

&#x200B;

Yes, almost. Currently, there is a single mechanic in the game which truly double dip: Trauma.

&#x200B;

Trauma, both Boneshatter and trauma support, have a quadratic scaling on ATTACK SPEED (and I put that in cap because if you have to remember one thing, remember this). It means, when you are doing a trauma support build, if you really intend to scale it, the most important stat is the attack speed, period. Boneshatter is also in such a case, but can be used """"""normally"""""" because the base skill is that insane, even if you don't stack it too much. But Divergent Boneshatter is actually closer to a CUBIC scaling but even better (Attack speed means more attacks, more attack speed and more damage), hence why delvers are using it to destroy deep delves, and it's compensated by a fairly long ramp up time, making it less appealing for general mapping (I mean the mega stacking boneshatter build, not the one where you cap at like 30 stacks). Anyway, this post is not about Boneshatter, because I'm not sure I can properly explain the maths behind the tipping points where you instant move from 1XX trauma stacks max to 30,30 attacks/s with 600 max stacks just because you added a buff.

&#x200B;

Back to Trauma Support. I said it had a quadratic scaling on attack speed. To understand what it means, let's take an example. We have a weapon with 0 base damage, 1 APS, 0% more damage, and the trauma support is adding 1 added damage to attacks per stack.

&#x200B;

[By varying the amount of increased attack speed, we have the following result:](https://preview.redd.it/qegnae0gzpib1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf6cf4d0e4c6cf2c4f165c0a9035cf22af41e81)

""Alright, I get it, doubling the attack speed means doing 4x the damage. That's cool. I guess it means I should focus everything on increased attack speed, then!""

Well, yes, but not quite. First, repeat after me: ""SPEED IS KING"". While it's true, the result goes much, much, much deeper than a paltry scaling on increased attack speed. While the example is about increased attack speed, it's not ONLY about increased attack speed. It's also about More attack speed.

[Example with ancestral protector:](https://preview.redd.it/qb0kaarhzpib1.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b23eee65d3158f675e535390a8ce68f32788b57)

As you can see, more attack speed are having a squared effect as well. Meaning if you truly intend to stack traumas, more attack speed buffs such as Berserk (73% more damage), ancestral protector (44% more damage), Blitz (96% more damage), Arena Challenger (44% more damage) are extremely important to scale your damage if you can actually include them in your build. Up to a certain point: You are still capped to 30.30 APS max, so having too much attack speed just doesn't do anything anymore at some point. But if you can reach this point, you probably understood what i'm writing anyway and know about the cap anyway.

# SPEED IS KING.

The thing is.... If you put the mouse on the ""more attack speed"" cell in pob, you will notice something...

[For instance flicker strike:](https://preview.redd.it/9bg6evgmzpib1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cf4e22c585593472c35bf6ec38531debf63a693)

As you can see, Flicker strike has a ""20% more attack speed"" in POB. It's not coming from nowhere, it's the attack speed modifier of the skill. And it's another extremely important part of scaling trauma support properly.

If I use the same weapon, with the same stats, but use two skills with two different base attack speed, the result will be vastly different.

For instance, let's say I compare Vigilant Strike to Flicker strike. For the example, I don't have charges for either skills, but I consider they don't have CD.

If I don't put Trauma support, Vigilant strike has a damage effectiveness of 350% with an attack speed modifier of 0.85, (so a base dps of 297.5% of weapon dps). Flicker, on the other hand, has an attack speed modifier of 1.2 for a damage effectiveness of 210% (So a base DPS of 252%, which is lower).

&#x200B;

But what if we plug Trauma support in these skills with the example weapon? Well, we get this:

https://preview.redd.it/9f18w2npzpib1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc889b27c8cae51a6748978f01a22a48dcec2473

So yes, Flicker wins by a fairly good amount, because with trauma support, SPEED IS KING.

Note it also works in reverse. Melee Physical damage support, with its 10% less attack speed, has actually a 19% less dps added to it due to that. Even the awakened MPD (+ intimidate) barely beats ""simple"" supports such as ruthless in a trauma stacking scenario.

And... It doesn't stop there. It's not only the skills, but obviously... The weapons. Many people argued that Frostbreath is by far the best weapon for trauma support because of the double damage. You may have seen me answering to them, and you will know what I will do next. But... when I say the attack speed is everything to trauma support, I do mean that. Frostbreath is not a particularly bad weapon, and scale decently well with trauma support... But the incontested champion of Trauma support is Brightbeak, because, once again, SPEED IS KING.

&#x200B;

[Comparaison between Frostbreath and Brightbeak in previous tests conditions, if they had 0 base damage:](https://preview.redd.it/7gnq3lktzpib1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=caef014a2d8a2819b324f8a19ef761b4c9594f0b)

As you can see, it's not a contest, Brightbeak is the peak weapon here, and on top of that, will offer you a much better confort while playing (more attack speed, no need to hit once before getting double damage, etc etc). It's just because you are basically comparing 1.45 \* 1.45 \* 2 = 4.2  (for frostbreath) to 2.2\*2.2\*1 = 4.84 (for brightbeak). **You will also notice that the ramp up time hasn't changed (same duration on both). It's not because brightbeak reach a higher amount of stack that you need more time to reach it. Being capped at 30 stacks doesn't mean your ramp up time is quicker than 50 stacks. It's the same.**

SPEED IS KING. For trauma support, if you truly intend to scale it for real, you need three things: As much attack speed as you can, a decent increased damage because at some point, if you are lacking too much, it beats even a quadratic scaling stat, and....

&#x200B;

# SPEED IS KING UP TO A CERTAIN POINT: Multistrike

&#x200B;

Yeah, I saw multiple people suggesting using trauma support with multistrike. Don't:

&#x200B;

[Only base damage from gear is actually \\""saving\\"" you.](https://preview.redd.it/qp5taqludqib1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=611bfca54dc72df8bd644002316e5dc9a7f30f59)

It's absolutely terrible. Either swap out trauma or Multistrike, but never ever use both. Multistrike is the only case where ""More attack speed"" is not enough to make it good. Obviously, fatal flourish is even worse.

&#x200B;

# THE COUNTERPOINT TO SPEED IS KING:

&#x200B;

I guess it will not have escaped the notice of some people that I ""forgot"" to talk about a very important point so far: The self damage. For trauma support, Speed is king up to a certain point, the point where you can't handle the self damage.

[Because the self damage also have a quadratic scaling, same as dps:](https://preview.redd.it/bjcb29ad0qib1.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=240cbded4f02ff1b34d2f1472c727c5a7082b6b3)

And the previous points are all true as well. Ancestral protector (44% more self damage), Blitz (96% more self damage), Arena Challenger (44% more self damage), Berserk... Well, not berserk, because it's cheating (73% more damage for 20% more self damage). And same for the skills and the base attack speed on weapons.

I'm not going to move into an explanation of armour, but basically, the more damage you take, the exponentially more armour you need. While it's realistic to use armour to tank 30-50 stacks, it's not if you intend to reach 200 trauma stacks like one of my flicker strike trauma slayer pob. And to reach this amount, you will need to find a way to get at least 70%, if not outright 90% PDR with 0 armour.

Meaning the following: If you just intent to plug in Trauma support and play with like 15-20 stacks of trauma, using it as utility to trigger CWDT and such while being a okay tier support gem, it's fine, but you are not using the support at full potential. And it's not a problem. If you can't handle a lot of trauma, it's fine to remove one of these more attack speed multiplier (by using a slower skill, a slower weapon, or something else). And that's the point I want to make: Frostbreath is a good entry level weapon if you are too squishy to really dive into trauma stacking. But using the trauma support at its full potential? A BIS? Not. Even. Close. Only case I could see Frostbreath being BIS is if we can reach 30,30 AS with it despite the low speed. We would need an alternate quality on the support similar to the one on boneshatter (And I honestly doubt it will be the case).

Outside of that, Frostbreath Trauma support is for squishy characters who aren't built around trauma support stacking. And it's not an issue, Trauma support is complicated to build around if you truly want to stack a triple digit amount of stacks (and you are basically locked in Jugg or Slayer unless you have multiple mirrors to throw at your character).

However, at some point, if the amount of trauma is not really high, you should really ask yourself if it's the proper support. Do I actually get more damage by using this support over using another one? What happen if I take a weapon with high pdps instead of a fast weapon/frostbreath? Is my PDR investment not too high for the returns I get from Trauma support? These are the questions you should really ask yourself if you are hovering below 25 stacks.

&#x200B;

Final things: Some people will throw PoBs at me telling me how wrong I am, look at it, Frostbreath is doing better than Brightbeak with Trauma support. Don't, I really don't care to check your pob. I just know one of the few next things is happening:

\- Unlike the example, Frostbreath (usually with glacial hammer) has a higher base damage than Brightbeak, and thus, the actual scaling from trauma support hasn't settled in. The pob you will show me will have a low amount of stacks (usually around 25 for Frostbreath, because higher, Brightbeak beats it handily even with the handicap of base damage), and the point you will be trying to prove will be the exact opposite of the point you are actually proving: Frostbreath beats Brightbeak the lower amount of stack you have, meaning it's not trauma support which is giving a good scaling to the weapon.

\- Or, more likely, it's people who plug in both weapons without changing the amount of stacks, or by giving an unfair advantage to frostbreath (such as AS corruption, while forgetting doing the same to brightbeak).

\- However, if you do manage to do the hypothetical example of a frostbreath with 30.30 APS without multistrike, go ahead, show it, I AM interested!

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading up to this point, I hope you learned something!

Edit: A point I forgot to make is the fact you are not stuck to leveling trauma support either. Same as divergent boneshatter is usually played lvl 8, a lvl 5-15 trauma support may add a more sustainable amount of self damage for a reduced amount of added damage, but still at your advantage. You will have to check if 30 traumas at lvl 20 is better than, for instance, 40 trauma lvl 15 and how much damage you take in both cases.",1692300058,trauma

My best friend lost a parent a year and a half ago which led him to a mental health crisis. Our friend group has been picking up the pieces ever since. He's doing much better now that he's in therapy, but he's definitely gone through it.

What has complicated matters worse is my fiancée. It goes without saying that I love her, but she is the definition of a busybody sometimes. My best friend is a very private person. She knows something happened with him, but she doesn't know the details of what that something is. She probably never will. But because she's around me and my friends often as my fiancée and I live in the same house, she hears bits and pieces of the story and presses for more information.

I try to circumvent this as best as I can - for example, I step out of the room for specific phone conversations. But still, it's hard to limit the discussion about it sometimes. If it’s necessary we bring it up and she’s around in person, we’ll refer to the 'Nolan situation' without giving specifics.

Nolan will also stop by my place at night when he can't sleep. This doesn't happen all that often - maybe twice a month. He'll text me or call me saying he's outside, I'll go sit with him and maybe smoke a little bit, then he'll head home. I'll wait up until I know he got home safely, then I go back to sleep. My fiancée hates this. She claims the phone calls always wake her up - they don't, she just sometimes happen to wake up for the bathroom while I'm outside - and that me not being in bed is alarming.

This brings us to last night. Nolan stopped by and when I came back inside, my fiancée said she was 'putting a stop to it.' She said all the sneaking around is making her paranoid, she doesn't feel like she can properly trust me or be a part of my friend group without knowing the details, and that Nolan needs to stop relying on me so much. I told her that no matter whether we're married, dating, whatever, she will never have any ownership over my friend's trauma, and that she was never going to be able to order me around in regards to it. I also said her comfort was less important than someone’s *actual physical well-being.* She was obviously hurt by this and went to stay with her mom after work today.

AITA?

**EDIT:**

She knows Nolan lost a parent, she doesn’t know the aftermath beyond the statement he had a mental health crisis. Yes, he has specifically asked me not to tell her.

**EDIT 2: February 23, 2023 (next day)**

This is not something we talk about “constantly” in front of her. I’m giving examples that have happened over the past year and a half. Also, Nolan sees a therapist. He comes to my place to hang out.

***Relevant Comments: (A lot of information comes out that was not included in the post. OOP has 50+ comments, so I tried to choose the ones with the most information.)***

*What exactly has she asked him?*

""He had a very negative reaction towards her asking for more information about how he was doing - once when she did it directly to his face, and once when I told him she was asking again to gauge his comfort levels with what I told her. Like I said he is intensely private and feels it is none of her business.""

""He hates feeling pitied and he hates the topic being brought up without him being the one to initiate it. There’s only so many “oh, how are you doing since… what happened?” questions one can get before it becomes tiresome. (He says no one wants a real answer anyway.)""

*Is it possible she thinks he is a danger to himself or others, especially if she doesn't know what is happening?*

""Hm… maybe? He hasn’t always been the kindest towards her (thanks to this situation and how she’s responded to it) so she could *possibly* think he’s a danger. She has never brought that up to me, though, and it didn’t come up in our conversation last night.""

""He’s never hostile but I wouldn’t say he was ever overly warm to people upon first meeting them. It’s nothing personal— it’s just his nature. Now, he’s slightly more guarded.""

*Background on fiancée and Nolan:*

""I’ve known Nolan since we were 15. I’ve been with my fiancée around two years now. We’ve been engaged for a majority of those two years (for reference, we got engaged about a month before Nolan’s dad passed.) At the time, he and I were both pretty consistently busy. He also isn’t one of those people who jumps into friendships quickly. So, they didn’t see much of one another prior to what happened, and afterwards they just weren’t a good match personality wise.""

""It was a spur of the moment engagement— no ring or anything until later. We currently have no plans to get married anytime soon.""

""We have the means for a wedding, it’s just not on our priority list right now.""

*More information comes out:*

""The POA **(Power of Attorney)** I have over him doesn’t go into effect unless there are certain circumstances. His parent died suddenly and it spooked him into getting his stuff in order. I have no tie to his finances right now and wouldn’t want to.""

""Yes, I’ve explained like I did here— that he was having a mental health crisis and needed support. I also helped him with some law stuff regarding he and I (a living will, me becoming a springing power of attorney, things like that that he was desperate to get in order), but I didn’t go into detail about that other than “Nolan needs my help with law stuff.” That’s about as much as she knows.""

*Is the POA recent?*

""It was not recent, no. It’s been months since it happened. He is okay, but I understand your concern. It scared the shit out of me at the time he first asked and we had extensive conversations about why.""

***Another commenter makes a great point:***

""Mate, POA is one of the primary documents we used to have to draw up for same-sex couples before marriage was legal in the US. That's not something you just do without telling your fiance. Your roommate, sure, but not *your life partner*. You sound young so maybe you don't realise the importance of what you signed, but you need to know that it is so much more than just a precautionary measure.""

*OOP's response to that:*

""Thank you for your advice. I do understand the gravity of it. It wasn’t a decision made lightly.

It doesn’t go into effect unless Nolan is unable to make decisions for himself, and is a precautionary measure he chose to take after his parent passed suddenly. The chances of it being something I have to take over soon are, thankfully, very slim.""

*Have you told Nolan that his secretive phone calls and late night visits upset your fiancée?*

""I have told him she was paranoid over the whole thing and that she doesn’t believe me when I say I’m just helping him out. He has his own opinions on how bizarre it is that she doesn’t believe me considering she can see his car in the driveway, but. Yes. We’re both a confused over why she wants more details than ‘Nolan is struggling with his mental health.’""

***One more thought from a different commenter and OOP's response:***

""Nolan is using you for support. You're his friend and it's great that you're there for him. But he is using you for support in an unhealthy way. It's unhealthy because it is causing problems for you, and it's becoming consistent. It's unfair of him to continue to use you without being considerate of what it is costing you. Either he needs to find a better way to get the support he needs or he needs to be willing to explain himself to some degree. To be clear, you are right, it isn't your story to tell. But Nolan needs to recognize the problem being created here.""

*OOP's response:*

""If it was uncomfortable for me, or it was costing me in a way that was truly damaging, I would tell him. I personally don’t think it’s healthy to start looking at the support we seek from others as burdensome. That’s a slippery slope towards no longer asking for help.

He is also in therapy so I’m not some kind of therapist stand in. If that was the case, I would definitely tell him straight up that he needed to get help and that I couldn’t be it.""

***OOP is voted YTA, especially when it comes out he has not told his fiancée he is Nolan's POA and is not taking her feelings into account.***

**Update: February 26, 2023 (**[Unddit](https://www.unddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cr1qf/update_aita_for_telling_my_fianc%C3%A9e_that_my/?sort=old) for comments and [WebArchive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230227004136/https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cr1qf/update_aita_for_telling_my_fianc%C3%A9e_that_my/) for post\*\*)\*\*

Since my first post, I have had three conversations with my fiancée relating to this topic. The first didn't go well. I still had a lot of walls up that didn't allow me to engage properly. I didn't get angry, I just didn't say much at all. My fiancée told me what a lot had already assumed: she didn't feel like a priority, she was hurt by my comment and my actions. She gave me specifics on what needed to change if we were to continue. I told her I needed time, and she went back to the parent's house for the night. I took this night alone to truly think over the things she had requested (no more late night visits and other harsh boundaries being put into place) and tried to imagine a life where that happened.

The second conversation was much more impactful. I took feedback I was given here - which mainly centered around honesty and apologies. I told her that I was sorry for waking her up and for not treating her how a fiancé should. I also told her I was sorry I hadn't been prioritizing her... but that I couldn't. At least not in the top, number one spot. The gist of my side was this: my life partner, in a lot of ways, has already been chosen. It might change in the future, but as of right now, my friendship is the most important relationship in my life. He isn't just *like* family to me, he *is* family to me. That goes beyond just the two of us: his little brother is my little brother. My mom and dad have all but officially adopted them into our family and vice versa. Our lives are intrinsically enmeshed and have been since we were 15. I had been doing a disservice to her by pretending that I could put anyone else over this familial unit that has already been built.

This conversation was difficult for us both. We cried together, we attempted to compromise, but the truth of it all boiled down to 'if he needs me, or even just wants me, I'm going to do everything reasonably in my power to be there."" We again, took the night for ourselves to process.

And that leads us to the final conversation, which was about our future. She told me she had known the end was coming and had begun to accept it long before our conversation. I agreed. We're also planning a 'move Jess out' party between just us two where we try to have fun with it and reconnect as friends. She told me, in customary break up fashion, that she's going to cut bangs in my bathroom at some point during this planned night.

So, was I the asshole for saying that my friend's trauma was more important than her comfort? Yeah. I was. Not only because it was harsh, but because I didn't say it sooner so she could make an informed decision about whether it was a life she wanted or not. Now she gets that. I feel gracious and humbled by her forgiveness and understanding, and thankful to commenters who provided insight.

ETA No, I’m not planning any more romantic relationships for a while. 2 - My number one priority is Nolan, not my *entire* family. He and I are the familial unit I referred to.

***Relevant Comments:***

*You have to make sure to tell your next partner they will never be number one in your life:*

""Relationships are very much on the back-burner for me right now, and for at least the next few years I assume. After some soul searching following this situation, I’ve come to realize that I just don’t have that space in my life for a romantic partner the way some people do. I don’t yearn for intimacy because I already have it. My emotional needs are already being met and I feel fulfilled. If that changes, then I might pursue something. Until then… I’m all good here.""

*Remember that romantic does not have to mean sexual:*

*OOP's response:*

""This is very true. I’m pretty open to anything in both regards. Romance and sexuality are not rigid for me. :)""

*Responding to those who tell him he NEEDS to set boundaries with Nolan for both of their healths:*

\*""\*I’m genuinely fascinated by this point of view. We *do* have other friends and boundaries with one another. Two people choosing to share their lives together and not actively pursuing romantic relationships doesn’t automatically lean towards something unhealthy. At least from my perspective. I think it’s all just about how people want to live their lives and different priorities. But I seem to be in the minority here.""

""There is only so much about my friendship with him I can include here, and this update post was largely centered around what happened with my ex-fiancée. Why would I list boundaries I have with my friend that are unrelated to this single conflict I posted about?

In my eyes: He didn’t sabotage anything. *I* chose my priorities, they were out of line with what was required for a romantic relationship, and I’m now out of that relationship. The value of said relationship is relative. I hope Jess and I remain close friends, but I feel relieved to be rid of extra pressures when I wanted to live my life one way and she wanted something else.""

""I have a therapist and I wish to god that there was no AITA character limit so I could fit all my repeated comments into the original post. He does not trauma dump on me. We talk like normal people do. He sees a therapist regularly. I’ve known him since we were 15, we’re 25 now.""

*Dude, why get engaged in the first place?*

""The engagement was a spur of the moment event when I had been drinking. I wouldn’t say it’s something I regret because I think both she and I knew it wasn’t a ‘marriage is right around the corner, let’s start planning now’ situation. I mostly just regret not having an honest conversation with her up front about the different places people took up in my life. That was a huge mistake on my end.""

*Are you attracted to Nolan?*

""Reflecting on how we first met, it was basically just me trying to manifest an excuse to talk to the cool tall boy I saw, and then I actually *got* that excuse and invited him over to my house during our first conversation. So… I certainly think he is nice to look at and particularly nice to spend time with. I don’t typically think that hard about my interactions with most men other than him.""

*Going forward:*

""I’m just letting things happen as they happen at this point. If he and I do move back in together, though, I think I’m going to just start telling people we’re together no matter what - if he’s comfortable with it, of course. There’s too many people who don’t get that I **do not** want a romantic relationship in any shape or form going forward (outside of this) and if this whole thing has taught me anything, it’s that I don’t want to be stuck answering questions about it my entire life. Lol.""

*Ex-fiancée:*

""She’s the one that suggested we remain friends. I came into things wanting to be completely honest. Other than that, the ball was in her court. If she wanted to forgive me, never see me again, whatever. That was purely up to her. Will it continue on past her moving out? I don’t know. But I do know I’m very glad we’re not ending on a totally sour note.""

*One more thought from OOP:*

""As I said in other comments, I think I worded the original post wrong because people are assuming I put him on the same level as my parents or siblings and that isn’t the case.

I honestly think people would’ve had a more positive reaction if I had said “I’ve been with Nolan this whole time, jokes on everyone!” than “I made a mistake proposing to my fiancée, I’m now single and can admit I feel emotionally fulfilled by this person. He is my life partner and I choose to share my life with him while also having other friends/family as well who don’t fall into that category of intensity.” Because half of the responses are “that’s so weird… you have to be having sex with the person you put number one in your life!”

He and I have spoken and are in agreement. He’s asked me to come to one of his therapy sessions so we can further discuss and I finally agreed and we set a date to make that happen.

Most of the comments on the post I made on my own page (which has since been deleted) were “we don’t care about Nolan, we just want to make sure your fiancée is good!” but now that I’ve affirmed that she’s okay, we’re going our separate ways\~\~,\~\~— it’s the opposite. I don’t know. The update was focused on her for a reason.""

**Edit: OOP had a few deleted comments that I did not include here because I could not tell if he was trying to troll the people who were asking questions or not.** But, because some questions have come up a few times in this BORU post, here is one of his deleted comments:

*Someone asks a very stereotypical sex life question about him and Nolan:*

Friends dying aside, they didn't show really any of the mutilation and torture that he went through, but what they did show was the Guardians' reaction to it.


Nebula saying, ""that's worse than anything Thanos did to me,"" and the others' sadness and rage at what HE did to Rocket paints a very vivid picture of the atrocities that were committed on him.


I've only seen it once, so I can't remember if this is the case, but after that scene it seems like none of the Guardians are taking any prisoners, quite literally.


I feel like other directors should take note; you don't necessarily need to show horrible things happening to a character (thinking SA and the like) to communicate that something did. It's almost more effective seeing the people closest to that character being so shaken by what they see or hear.",1683634644,trauma

First of all I want to say thank you to all the kind souls who left supportive and kind messages. I tried to read them all but there were just too many.

My husband and I have decided to separate for the time being as I can’t really get over just how weird and abusive he’s been over the past few months. He is currently letting me stay in the house until we figure out the next steps and although he keeps apologizing, I’ve decided to leave him and start my life over. 

To everyone telling me to go back to my home country. I can’t. It’s not so easy. I did however call my family and told them everything and they were surprisingly supportive and we’ve talked everyday since my original post and I couldn’t be happier about that. 

To everyone who left me horrible messages. Im sorry you are so full of hate and wish horrible things on people. But I will end up stronger than ever after this. So thank you.

My husband has been nothing but supportive In my wanting to leave and start over so all I can do is figure it out and take the advice of my family and my lawyer. Yes, I’ve been in contact with a lawyer but haven’t hired her yet as I’m waiting to get the money from my husband who has volunteered to pay for it. 

Thanks again, hope this update was sufficient for everyone.",1591861962,trauma

He flew over some giant hole by a lake on The Lost Island map, Rexxxy happily ran along behind him without looking where she was going and fell into the hole.

We immediately dropped everything to get on the pteranodons and flew down the hole to see if she was okay, and luckily she didnt die from the fall!
My heart slightly recovered until I noticed she was biting at something in the darkness.

I just had my open male rhinoplasty on Monday afternoon and I'm on day 3 of recovery. There doesn't appear to be a ton of forums online for people to share their experiences so thought I'd share mine and see if anyone has any advice, tips or general thoughts about my experience thus far.

Biggest takeaways!

- My throat hurts more than anything! This I find to be the thing I never heard about from anyone before going into this. My doctor says it's normal from being intubated but it's honestly the worst sore throat I've ever had. Not being able to breathe through my nose at all is what really exacerbates the problem and makes it hard for it to get better. On my third day I've felt no improvement and my throat is raw and is very painful to swallow/eat and there are no signs that it's about to get any better. Throat spray and cough drops not helping. Anyone else experience this? Any advice? I was told by a friend that 7-Eleven Slurpies was the best medicine for her.

- The breathing - you can't breathe through your nose, period. I haven't felt this improving either in the first three days. I've heard from some that the breathing won't at all improve until the cast is removed after 1 week.

- Cleaning the sutures and applying ointment is what I've been focused on throughout my day. The first day home and day one I had to have the bandage mustache due to discharge and bleeding but yesterday and today I am without it. There is still a little bit of bleeding/discharge but I mainly just dab it with gauze as if it's a runny nose every so often. When will the sutures just stop bleeding and heal over? I feel like they should have by now.

Thanks and feel free to ask me questions too!",1604595509,recovery

It’s not just for this purpose. My baby has been measuring on the larger side and it’s getting hard on me mentally and physically (I’m 30 weeks now). I already have hip issues, scoliosis, and pelvic floor issues.

Some people have told me c-section is better and I do see some benefits regarding this. Some people have told me  induction is not a good experience at all. 

But others act like c-section is a terrible thing and I won’t be able to take care of my baby. The women who seem to say this to me the most, haven’t even had a c-section, so I am a bit skeptical. My mum has had both natural and c-section and she wasn’t even sure which is better. Her c-section was emergency though so likely more traumatic than a scheduled one.

3460,I recently had to implement my disaster recovery plan.,19828,zeo31j,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/zeo31j/i_recently_had_to_implement_my_disaster_recovery/,695,"About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially ""good with computers"" set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn't super unusual.

But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn't have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn't anything that would fit our needs.

Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and ""nothing is going to happen, you worry too much""

So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn't make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn't want to pay for it.

And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. 

So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said ""I quit,"" I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job. Disaster recovery plan worked exactly how I planned.",1670375697,recovery

One for her right forelimb elbow and one for her hip bone. I never wanted to put a cone on her but I couldn't find a soft cone in nearby pet shops and the ones I ordered online didn't fit her at all. I checked for recovery suits but her stitches are in such places that the recovery suit won't cover any of them. And she has stitches in 6-7 different places. 

Since I couldn't find a recovery suit that would cover her right arm as well as her entire hip and around the butt, I had to put a cone on her which she absolutely hated. It felt like she wouldn't open up all stitches just by trying to take it off. 

So I ordered a 0-3 months old sized onesie and it fits her so well plus she looks so adorable I can't get over it.

In my youth I was heavily addicted to meth and opiates. Not only did I lose a lot of my hair, but contact with my friends and family. I got involved with the wrong people. I made many horrible decisions. I now have 7 years sobriety from meth and 4 years sobriety from opiates. 
My hair journey has been a rollercoaster. It took YEARS for my hair to get back to a healthy state. This is the healthiest my hair has been since highschool. I am proud of how far I've come. I don't know if there's anyone else in this subreddit who's dealt with mental health issues and drug addiction, but if there are others just know that you're not alone, recovery IS possible, and your body will thank you for turning things around ❤️",1694880318,recovery

I’m currently 38+4. We were talking about visitors and his family, who live relatively close, are coming to visit ASAP. As in, probably the day of/days within baby being born. 

My family is visiting in early September, after only a couple weeks postpartum. All families know that I won’t be hosting as I’ll be healing and they are just there to visit baby anyway. 

The squabble comes in when my DH mentioned that I could go grocery shopping to “get a break” while family is visiting. Our nearest store is 20 minutes away. I kind of gave him a crazy look and said I had no intentions on leaving the house for anything short of a drs appt. If he needs groceries, that’ll be on him. I’ll be healing and resting and taking care of our newborn. 

His argument is that women go back to work as early as a week after birth so obviously recovery won’t be as hard as I think it will. That by two-three weeks, I should have no problem walking that much around the stores.

Just wondering what everyone’s recovery time was. Any help or insight is appreciated!

ETA: thank you so much to everyone who commented! Honestly I was starting to think I was crazy for thinking recovery would be longer than I thought but everyone has been so helpful! Please don’t be too hard on my husband!! This is both our first kid and neither of us know too much, though I do agree that he could put in the effort like I am to do research, like taking classes, reading books, and watching YouTube videos etc. He’s been supportive and caring this entire pregnancy, just a bit naive about this topic. I’m definitely going to sit him down and talk about what both our expectations/game plan is once baby is born.",1691386984,recovery

The California-based company predicted it would add 3.5m subscribers in the third quarter, disappointing investors who were looking for a stronger rebound in the second half of the year. Analysts had forecast that Netflix would add 5.9m subscribers during the third quarter.

In the past year and a half, Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, Comcast and others have launched streaming platforms, and there are more than 100 streaming services for consumers to choose from, according to data company Ampere.

3609,TIFU by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong',38984,aye68w,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aye68w/tifu_by_naming_my_password_recovery_answer_as/,1080,"This happened about a week ago. It still gives me shivers.

Obviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.

I spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.

A female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,

""What is your most prized possession?""

I froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

I wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.

So, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""I'm sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)""

""Dong schlong. Thank you, sir.""

I was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

I've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and I had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

EDIT:

Holy mother of schlong this blew up... Thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

And yes, looking back, I should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. But this had never happened to me and I think I just panicked. I'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

It’s a very long and convoluted story but I lost my license due to drug diversion. My license was suspended for 2 years in a non-compact state and revoked in 2 compact states.  Everyone was shocked - I had literally JUST been awarded “employee of the month” when the ish hit the fan. I have now been clean for 8 1/2 years but I rarely hear about nurses in recovery. When I initially got my license back, I sent over 2,000 resumes. I got hundreds of interviews but no one wants to hire a nurse whose license has been suspended (and I didn’t blame them!) I finally got a job at a non-profit that assisted unhoused clients who struggled with mental health issue. I was an RN on an ACT team. I ultimately lost that job due to not meeting their productivity requirements (80 units per week + ridiculously detailed documentation). I then found a job at another non-profit helping patients who were either terminal or HIV+ and needed help with medical compliance. Unfortunately, I was (literally) on call 24/7 for almost 4 months and I burned out. I then worked at a methadone clinic for 16 months until a city hospital decided to “give me a second chance” and hired me as an Emergency/Trauma nurse. (Emergency is where I started in 2003 - worked as a PCT, then nurse intern, then nurse extern, then RN). I have been back in the ED for 18 months and words can’t express how thrilled I am to finally be back “home”. Yes, it’s stressful but it’s my jam. I have been on the fence about posting this (someone else posted a while ago and was doxxed), but I have been thinking frequently about how few nurses are open about being in recovery. I have literally worked with hundreds of nurses and I know TWO who have gone through a nursing diversion program. (One is back in the profession, the other didn’t make it.) I remember the day I found out I was losing my license. I thought my life was over. My identity was so enmeshed with being an ER nurse. If anyone is struggling, please don’t lose hope. Keep trudging. You can make it to the other side! Feel free to contact me if you have questions or need to vent. I am about to start the process of seeing if I can get my license back in either of the compact states that revoked it. Fingers crossed!",1693134730,recovery
