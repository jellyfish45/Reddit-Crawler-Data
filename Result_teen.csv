So like six people or something, not much at all. I don't have many friends, for obvious reasons. I don't have any acquaintances. There will be max 20 people attending my funeral. They always say there's more people when a young person dies. That's not the case for me, if I'm still considered young at 27... Nobody knew me or liked me. When people got to know me, they dropped me. As they should, I suck.

I've tried everything these past few weeks to feel better. I exercise, I hang out with friends, I do things that are considered fun. I enjoyed nothing and just ended up crying myself to sleep every day. I'm crying as I'm typing this, I'm in so much pain.

I don't think there's anything else for me to arrange. It's just me in this life. My parents will get my money and that's it.

I am not 18. Or 16. Or 21. I am 39, soon to be 40. I had a great life.  Then I lost my job. Then I lost my house. Then my friends. Then  freedom and independence. I am now the stereotypical loser living with their parents. No job. No life. No happiness.

The crazy thing about suicide is that rarely does it come out of the blue.   It's a buildup of a lot of stuff.  
I wouldn't say all of this is my fault. The job market and economy is crap. I could work minimum wage again, but honestly when you have nothing to look forward to this is what happens.  America has gotten rough.

Take this story as a cautionary tale. Get help when you are younger. The older you get, the harder it is to change your thought patterns. Depression and Anxiety got to me, and have won. 30 years ago they didnt have the treatment and awareness they have now.  There is hope for you younger adults.

Too late for me. I screwed up too many times. While my classmates got married and rose up the ladder, I kept pace until 6 months ago.  Life throws curveballs like this, but it knocked me down and frankly nobody cares. I got left in the dust by my friends. My parents pity me while my siblings have great lives. The worse part about being suicidal is people filling you with false hope so you will shut up and leave them alone.

I had some good times, some bad times, and sad times in life. But depression and anxiety won the war while I won some battles. I did the best I could.

I hope that this can help someone so they dont end up like me.  Work hard, listen to your peers, dont burn bridges. Get therapy and medication right away if yoh are struggling.  Don't end up like me. Dying is tragic but having a really pathetic life before dying is even worse.

May others find happiness that I could not on this Earth.

everytime i feel suicidal, i just write, and write and write. i confess my trauma, i tell my hate. the things i can never say. i try to say everything. yeah its like a diary maybe but it feels like im writing an autobiography.

maybe that sounds too narcissistic. i dont know how else i would describe it. 

when i finish the book, ill kill myself. i wish everyone i loved or hated would read it. maybe so that people can finally see my side of the story. 

every single entry in that book is raw, its pure pain and honesty, maybe thats why it doesnt feel like the cringey teenager kind of diaries

i am two thirds done with the book.

edit: people have gotten the wrong idea of my book. this isnt something im going to publish like one of those novels you see in book stores. its just like a suicide note, but theres so much i have to say that im using a book. maybe i will post some pictures but it isnt something im going to publish. im not a writer, im not good at writing, im just a teen with a lot of things to say",1687370615.0,suicide

I've struggled with depression since I was 14. I've been making significant progress in therapy and I am the happiest I've ever been. But somehow I keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

I have a fear of being elderly and alone. I am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. I'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. And then today I realized that I pretty much already am forgotten about. I moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. My mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. The only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. She never asks me how I'm doing or what's going on with me. I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

So ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die.

6,69.0,Prepare for Suicide?,3,17bzh65,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17bzh65/prepare_for_suicide/,15,"Hi everyone, sorry if this post is a little messy or in the wrong place.....thanks for taking the time to read ;)  
I know that this is a very taboo subject but it has been something that has riddled my mind for a long time now. I am a 25 year old  average male that has dealt with severe depression, dopamine trouble, and substance/alcohol issues since I was 14 years old. I have been on 9 different SSRIs throughout this troublesome period with my most recent one (Vybriid) being somewhat helpful after finding it through a gene sight test. I have spent the last few years meeting with a telespych therapist weekly which I have found to be pretty successful. Even though I have made it this far....I just cannot take it anymore.  
I have lived an alright life, despite being a very troubled child and teenager. I got a very nice associates degree, great job making around $80,000 with amazing benefits,  had great friends through the years, and had an awesome relationship through high-school and college. I am currently acquiring my Bachelors degree through Purdue University (West Lafayette) online thanks to therapy. I really cannot seem to find the reasoning as to why I have dealt with suicidal ideation for so long. Even though I have been able to acquire and experience some of these great things, I feel that my struggle through it was hellacious and unneeded.   
This was not made for me to brag, but it helps to just give an idea and for me to reflect on some of the good things I have had in life. Besides a relapse binge on alcohol for the past few months I had previously spent this past year completely clean and sober from everything except marijuana. Even though I was clean, I felt even more depressed and suicidal with some positive change. I don't understand how some people can live such amazing lives or be so hyper focused on making them amazing while some of us carry the weight of suicide the majority of our lives. If there is a god, I have tried my best to ask for guidance and relief.   
Anyway, I have started to come to terms with the fact that I might fight this illness for the rest of my life and am finally coming to my end. I do not view suicide as a selfish act, as it takes an immense amount of pain to hold a gun to your head or fill your bedroom/car with inert gas. This is not just something that I want to do in the ""spur of the moment"" and it has been on my mind for a long time. Also, my friends and family have known I have struggled for a long time. Really I feel that they would be the selfish ones for keeping me here in this pain, despite trying my best to make my suicide the easiest I can for them. I pulled out a life insurance policy a few years ago, so that when I did decide to do it, the insurance company would still payout because my insurance has a suicide clause of 2 years. I am going to try and discreetly sell most of my belongings, close social media accounts the night of, I will put all of my pictures and photos (I love photography) onto a drive so that they can access some of my memories. I have no children and zero pets, so I am leaving no dependents behind. I will try my best to pay my debts down the best I can, but the insurance should take care of most of it.  
My question is, what else can I do to best prepare for this? I want the people that care to feel the least pain possible. I just wish we had a proper euthanasia program in place to stop these nasty and unplanned suicides from happening.  


I really think it is just my time to go. Some people become amazing people, some end up in car accidents, some die from cancer, some have great opportunities, and some were born a little blessed in every area.  


Everyone fulfills a statistic and I believe mine was meant to be suicide.

7,77.0,Small penis = suicide,395,huv6tj,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/huv6tj/small_penis_suicide/,90,"Just turned 27, still a virgin. Been with a few women but it never works, they look at me like I'm the most disgusting piece of shit on the planet even though there's nothing I can do about it. It's not even about just being small, I don't care that I have to sit to pee or that I can't even masturbate properly. It's about living a lonely, unfulfilling life and how much society despises guys like me. I'm never going to find a partner or know what love feels like and it makes everything in life feel pointless. Never going to have a girlfriend or get married or have kids, it's all a waste of time. All because of something supposedly so ""trivial"". 

I feel like at least half the people who read that title immediately thought ""how pathetic, what a loser"" and that's part of the problem, this is never taken seriously. It's hard to get through one day without seeing some kind of reminder that people hate and are disgusted by small guys, and yet it's somehow our fault for feeling bad about it. People say it's our attitude, and I have to wonder, where do they think this attitude comes from? Do you think we're born full of self-loathing and insecurity? I've been rejected by everyone I've ever been intimate with and it's always specifically because of my size. People, not size queens or shallow idiots, regular people have preferences and make it clear they don't like small dicks. And the thing is that's totally fine, you like what you like, no shame there. But why do people have to hate us so much on top of that? Isn't it enough that most of us are extremely unhappy? 

I was bullied constantly in high school after I was seen in the change rooms. Was called ""trans"", ""pindick"", etc. Then I'd come home and see the 'award-winning' Australian anti-speeding ad on TV every night (it's on youtube). I wonder how many other young guys saw that and knew that they were that disgusting, horrible thing that no one wanted to be compared to. That's just one example but it's everywhere and when it's directed at you it's hard to not become hyper aware of all of it. 

Despite the bullying, I think trying a condom for a first time is what made me realise how worthless I was. Regular ones were way too big, even snug ones don't stay on. It feels like every guy goes through this stage, it's like being put into categories that determine your value. Regular? Well, nothing special but at least you're normal, all fine. XL? Impressive, a real man who everyone will be happy with. Small? Ugh... just sit in the corner and don't bother anyone. I knew what the average was from reading online, so when I finally measured I wished I was dead, I've never felt more worthless as a person. 

You might think that because penis size is a private thing that makes it okay, and easier to deal with. But it couldn't be further from the truth. I'm short and really ugly as well and when people insult those things I hardly care, but penis size is different. When I walk into a room, people immediately know I'm short and ugly, and that's the end of it. What can they do to me? Not to mention that anyone who insults those things gets called out because neither are considered acceptable. But when it comes to penis size it's completely fair game. No one speaks up, and having to laugh along and pretend I'm normal to not 'out' myself is honestly exhausting. Being ugly and short doesn't bother me much at all, but having a small dick does. Size is inherently tied to our masculinity and self-worth whether we want it to be or not. I wish I could change and not care about it but I can't. 

I know that no one really gives a shit, it's all just words on a screen isn't it? People don't comprehend that we're real people and statistically you probably know at least one guy who is small and struggling to deal with it, it could even be a family member or a friend. You'll never know it though, because he laughs along with the jokes and keeps up the facade to appear normal while inside he hates himself. It'd be interesting to know how many men are depressed and suicidal because of this. I guarantee it'd be way more than you might think. Even on this sub there are countless posts from guys who are suicidal over their size. But as I said earlier this issue is not taken seriously, we're seen as ""pathetic incels"" and told it's our own fault. Size is trending up and society is just becoming more obsessed with bigger dicks and more disgusted by small, it's only going to get worse. 

There needs to be a way to detect this from birth, no sane parent would've kept me. Ah well, nothing of value lost, one less ugly small-dicked guy to disappoint people I guess. I've been so unhappy for so long, I don't remember what anything good feels like. Since realising I was always going to be alone and unwanted, even things I used to enjoy don't make me happy at all. It just feels like wasting time. Being born like this almost guarantees a miserable life, but at least I don't have to be here.",1595283714.0,suicide

I understand that I have it better off than those in poverty but living in wealth with no need to work for anything has been a miserable existence that has left me suicidal.


My family is what you would consider nouveau riche, with my father being raised in lower middle class and making everything by himself.


But rather than pass his drive and grit he has done nothing but overwhelm me with excess. As a teenager I used to be more introverted and would prefer to stay in and play minecraft rather than go out, this confused him and he pushed me to go out, spend money in clubs and restaurants with his friends kids and enjoy a life of excess. 
I guess I understand where he is coming from, never having had any of this I guess he wanted to give me all he never had.


But after years of unlimited credit cards, expensive habits, and substance usage, I find myself at 24 with absolutely no drive.


Why would I work? I have a credit card that I can get anything with, a nice car that takes me anywhere, for fucks sake I even have maids that clean up my room so I don't have the basic skill of organizing my surroundings.
I am essentially a 24 year old child.


I am sure the reaction I will get here with be overwhelmingly negative as this problem sounds absurd. Most of you will think me spoiled and out of touch with reality. The worst part is you would not be wrong, I absolutely am.

I stabbed myself in kindergarten because I didn't have any hesitations in the concept of harming myself and I felt no positive emotions. Another little kid jokingly told me they would attack me (in the child make believe violence way) and my response was that I didn't care if they did. My other memories are all just constant existentialism and a feeling of disconnect towards my own emotions and experiences. I remember being on the playground and questioning the concept of free will because of a constant feeling of just going through the motions without a genuine connection to my own choices and person. I was labeled gifted for my outlook, but in all honesty it's always just been a heavy suicidality. 

I can't remember a period in my life before being suicidal. I've always wanted to die. Literally always. That's part of why I can't wrap my head around the saying that suicidal ideation is temporary, because for me it isn't. It's never once changed, it never really started anywhere and it's never seemed to end much. I'm intrinsically suicidal. My only real dreams in life are centered around dying. It feels like it's the only thing that gives me and sense of comfort.

I'm wondering now if it really just means I'm destined to die young. Every therapist I've ever seen has been stumped and every person I've ever talked to has been overwhelmed or not understanding. I honestly think I belong in a mental hospital with how absolutely insane I must sound, or be i suppose, but I honestly feel further isolation from society would only make me want to die more, and I'd rather be dead than be crazy and stuck in a mind of torturous existence. I don't think I was ever meant to exist. 

I'm honestly not sure what to do at this point because all the years I've spent searching for answers have been to no avail and I'm just really tired of living this way. I'm holding out hope that support could fix me enough to function like a normal human being, but when all my life I've been told I need to fix my own problems and that no one else can save me, I figure that considering there's no healthy way for me to exist I might as well not. I've tried absolutely everything. There's not a single piece of preexisting advice that I haven't given numerous long-standing shots.

I'm also extremely accustomed to people simply not believing me. Everything about me is an outlier and it makes it impossible to find connection in my life.

I was a little disappointed to hear that from her but she’s always made comments like that my entire life. I’ve had a eating disorder in the past which caused me to lose a lot of weight back then. She felt the same way during that time too. I know I’ll never been any more then the measurements of my body to her since I can’t amount to anything compared to my older siblings.

Oh boy was I wrong after seeing my dad abuse my mom for 2 years I was put into several foster homes along with my brother's and sister but we were separated but still had communication. 

I was in countless foster homes maybe 6 and in all of them I was abused, hit with a belt, didn't get food, locked in my room 24/7 it was tough but later on after a few months I was reunited with my siblings in the same foster house there I lived a normal life for a bit but once I reunited with my family everything went to hell. My brother's were allowed to reunite with me but not my sister for legal reasons.

Once we reunited with my parent's the abuse continued it got so bad that there was fights maybe 3 times a week seeing how my mom got hit and couldn't do anything about it made me feel powerless.

My dad was battling cancer for a few years so me and my mom and dad decided to go to Mexico to see family before he passed away my brother's stayed with their real dad. In mexico things got worst, living on the streets, more abuse, sometimes day's without eating. It was bad but thing's got better over time for a bit

But the abuse's came and go years I lived to see my mom get tormented by my farther and I felt so powerless couldn't do anything

My brother's came to Mexico where we just saw our mom get abused sometimes I was hit that's when I started seeing thing's clearer than before my whole life I've been punished and gone through hell and my life is still that way but I couldn't do anything about it.

In 2021 my dad lost his fight to cancer and he passed away I felt useless I still remember everything vividly the weeks leading to his death how he screamed in pain and complained and vomited he couldn't stand up any more the day at the hospital where he passed I didn't want to go because I didn't want to see my dad suffer but I went anyways in that hospital room is where I felt the most useless in my life I always think back and think about how if I said something to him he would get better but all I did was hold his hand and tell him I love him.

My dad passed away June 15th 2021 everybody at the hospital cried my family members, my mom. It was hard I couldn't cried my aunt told me to cuz later on it'll affect me but I didn't cry not at his funereal or his burial

When my dad passed my family forgot about me and my sibling's we needed to sale pretty much everything to pay the hospital bills the funeral coverage's everything in the end we were left with nothing my mom killing her self working for us to be able to sleep and eat. That's when she met my stepfather geez sometimes I wish she didn't

My step father came into my life and well thing's have gone horrible countless fights, arguments, everything gone to shit. Today was probably one of the worst day's of my life my dad hit my mom on the head and she started to bleed all because he wanted to drink while listening to music on the speaker and my mom wanted to sleep he got physical with us he pulled out a knife I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared I really was but at the same time I wish he had stabbed me take me out of this life of suffering things have gone worse since he showed up.

I was molested by him twice I haven't told anyone, my depression has gotten worse to the point where I'm thinking about suicide, I've had multiple fake friend's just leaving me alone to suffer same with relationship's especially one that really hurt me, getting hit and yelled at by him.

Throw yourself into the sea and watch yourself fight for survival. You dont want to kill yourself, you want to kill something within you.""

I have been suicidal and depressed on the latter part of my teenage years. Even now i feel depressed from time to time, we all do i think. But i want to flip the common thought of depression on its head, just to look at it from another perspective. Im not denying that suicidal thoughts and depression has neurological base but im not going to talk about brain structure and all that stuff. I think you can deal with depression here and now.

People who are depressed and want to commit suicide are the ones that might love life too much. The universe is flowing through them at the speed so fast that they can't handle. They are too full of ocean of life and have too much feels. What they really are seeking for when they want to commit suicide is to return home, to the source, to rejoice with the vast ocean that is life. They very much want to live and they want to live authentically.

What they really want to kill is the ego, which fabricates the story of their life which they now realize is bizarrely illusionary. The idea one has to end ones life is actually a point of awakening. They want to wake up and they want to reach the bridge of life and get to the otherside, which could also mean death. Death feels very certain and very real. Life on the otherhand intangible and uncertain, it's always moving.

I think this is why many people have had experiences of awakening right after coming out of the darkest hours. Now when i feel sadness and negative emotions, i look them as an opportunity and an invitation to change the current narrative of my life that isn't working out for me, or to delete it completely.

I try to face my emotions head on, rather than suppress them, by metitation. I sit, eyes closed, hold my thoughts and emotions like a baby. Bathe yourself in your emotions. Listen to them. Listen to the underlying intelligence beneath the sadness because it's there for a reason. It's there to try to communicate something. It has to be heard. Don't fight it. Witness it, be friends with it, laugh with it. Beacuse ultimately they are part of life and part of nature and part of you. If you can accept bad weathers like storms, hurricanes or earthquakes as part of nature, then there is no reason why you shouldn't perceive sadness under the same light.

The storm can only pass if you let it come first.",1626526656.0,depression

My boyfriend (15 trans dude, I'll call him M) and I (15 m) liked each other for a while but were too scared to tell the other until I did back in April. M's last relationship ended with him breaking up with his boyfriend due to M not being able to handle his emotions and a relationship.  We started dating about 6 months later on May 31st and this is my first relationship.  I've already asked my mother (a very kind woman who's unfortunately had a similar experience as my boyfriend when she was young) for advice, and it did help.

  
So what happened is that last night, we hung out with each other where we usually do, but he was obviously feeling a lot worse than usual. We decided to suspend our relationship so he can get better, but I can't just sit around and watch him hurt. He grew up (and continues to grow up) in a structureless household with 5 siblings.  One of them (I'll call him Pat) pretty much raised my M.  But Pat was (and is) a complete asshole, and through talking with M last night, we discovered that one of the catalysts of his depression is Pat because he was the person that M was pretty much forced to look up, but this person is an abusive, gaslighting, piece of crap. So whenever Pat comes back (he was gone for a year), M sees this person who was supposed to be his older brother, but he just comes back to be abusive again.  M has attempted suicide in the past (I'm not certain how many times, but I'm not sure if the quantity matters).

  
M has already tried therapy, but has told me that all of his therapists ""gave up on him"".  I think he wants me to as well but I can't, so I made a reddit account so I can try and ask advice from other people who have probably had similar experiences because, as much as I hate to say it, this is unfortunately not uncommon.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know and ask questions if things are too confusing as well.  Thank you in advance!",1691181916.0,depression

(When my dad was younger, some people would ask my aunt if he had aspergers) Front temporal lobe dementia? Brain damage from a heart attack during heart surgery a decade ago? A Brain Tumor? Chemo brain? What is wrong with him? 

My dad is the most awkward and strangest person to ever live. I wish my dad was dead. I’m a 21 year old female, and My dad (M/60) is the root of my severe treatment resistant depression and severe anxiety. He is physically and verbally abusive, sexist, apathetic, cold, he is EXTREMELY socially awkward and is socially inappropriate, and sometimes acts psychotic. 

(Trigger warnings: suicide) 
Some background: I survived a suicide attempt via drug overdose on my 19th birthday. And I am going to start ketamine infusions this month because all antidepressants have failed me. I live with my mom (F/60) and my sister (F/22) and my dad. I am a freshman in community college (I started late, due to multiple stomach problems, Gastroparesis, Hiatal hernia, Stomach ulcers, esophageal ulcers, GERD, IBS, gallbladder problems/removal, 4 stomach surgeries, probably caused by extreme stress)....I’ve tried to move out 3 times since I was 16. I’ve stayed with a family friend but was rejected by their adult kids who didn’t want me living there, I’ve stayed with my grandma, but she lives extremely far away from my college, and she recently broke her leg and is in a rehabilitation/physical therapy center. I’ve stayed with my aunt, but my stuff was continuously stolen, all of my makeup was stolen, (they had a cleaning lady who came to clean once a week) and I was in a very small storage room that made me depressed. And my aunt says now is not a good time for me to be living there Because of her personal issues. So I’m stuck at home for now. I’m on disability for my Depression and paralyzed stomach, but I want to get a job this summer, hopefully I’ll be more mentally stable by then.....I love art, music, and dancing, but I am way too depressed and unmotivated lately to create anything. I am failing some of my college classes....


My dad is the most severely awkward person I’ve ever known. I bet my mom only married him because his parents had some money. He can’t form sentences properly, he has an awkward walking gait (he is hunched over and his neck will lean forward and bob up and down, has little arm swing movement, his hands are always in fists, and his feet drag and hit the ground loudly. Even hearing him walk gives me anxiety), he will only talk about his interests, uses awkward hand gestures to describe things that don’t match what he’s saying, He has an EXTREMELY loud voice, and he will interrupt people constantly while they're talking mid-sentence. He doesn’t even make eye contact with me when I try to talk to him, he will just say “uh-huh” or “oh” to everything I say. Recently I shared my dance video with him (I take dance classes) and his reaction was an indifferent “Oh.” But when I make a small mistake he will have a paragraph to say to me. One time I accidentally clogged the toilet at 2 am and the next morning there was some water on the ground. I cleaned it up, and my dad yelled at me and said I’m irresponsible, inconsiderate, that I don’t care about people (Lol what?). He makes inappropriate facial expressions at random times. He will make a painful cringe face anywhere for no reason, at a restaurant, etc. I asked him why is he making that face and he accused me of insulting him. He can’t speak properly. He recently asked me “D-Do ya think over-over proportion coronavirus?” And I think he was trying to ask “Do you think the coronavirus is blown out of proportion?” He also repeats words in every sentence. His new favorite word is “Basically.” Basically this happened and basically she basically did that, which happened basically” is all I hear. He takes HUGE bites of food and overly stuffs his mouth when eating. He’ll make random grunting noises for no reason, when he’s walking to the living or randomly. Sometimes I think he “stims” He will rub his hands together very fast for a few seconds. I’ve tried to get him to see a doctor, I’ve tried to get my mom to get him to see a doctor, but nothing is happening...I think the next part is probably one of the most socially inappropriate things he’s ever done


Last year I was helping my musician friend film a music video and my dad drove me and my sister to help. Her family and friends were there and it was great, we had a normal calm conversation about camera work, and then, out of fucking nowhere, my dad starting excitedly yelling unintelligibly and moving his hands erratically. He seemed to be very excited about something for no reason. He said “ITHHFKSBBF FUEHRBD WKSJDBR EJDJRJF!!!” All while smiling and moving his hands back and forth towards his face quickly. And then he put his hands in his pockets and thrusted his hips forward and did a dance and stuck his tongue out. 

WHAT. THE. FUCK. 

My friends and her family ignored him because they thought he was a homeless guy on drugs at first!!! He went up to her mom and tried talking to her but she ignored him (as she should). I know he doesn’t take drugs, I know him, and I was with him all day. I was too embarrassed to say he was my dad. And he waited outside in the car while we filmed inside. There have been several other instances of him doing weird shit like this, and I’ll look down in shame. I used to cry about it as a teenager. I never have any friends over. I’m introverted and have social anxiety, and I’d like to invite friends over, but I don’t want them to meet my dad or have my dad pull shit. 

He doesn’t have any close friends, his mom and sister cut ties with him, his nieces hate him his brother in law hates him, everyone hates him. and he only talks to random strangers about sports. That is literally ALL he ever talks about to people outside his family. Always sports. Nothing else. He can’t learn basic things like changing the tv signal from HDMI to the DVD player, he will get pissed if I don’t change the tv for him. He can’t learn the basics of playing a board game and he lashed out and screamed because he didn’t understand, and I was 15 at the time. He is extremely scarily obsessed with saving money, he never buys me or anyone birthday gifts or Christmas gifts. He doesn’t heat or cool the house, he digs in public trash cans to find bottles and cans to recycle them for a few bucks. When I was younger we’d go to subway to share a 5 dollar foot long, and he’d complain to the cashier “That’s expensive!” As if the cashier would lower the price just for him. One time I was at a restaurant and my dad bought a kids meal for me. I was 19 at the time. I’ll elaborate more on his extreme cheapness. He doesn’t care about anyone. 

My dad has abused me over the smallest things. He physically and verbally abused me when I was a teenager. He isn’t abusive anymore, but I have extreme anxiety around him, and he lives at home and is unemployed. Even when I’m not at home or around him, I am extremely anxious. I have constant intrusive thoughts about how much I hate him and I am seeing a therapist and we are working on skills to help me tolerate my dad. But it’s not working. I’ve tried EMDR therapy, TMS therapy. So I am looking for a new therapist and possibly DBT therapy so I’m not so sensitive about him. He is unemployed And has been for 10
Years because he has Basal Cell Carcinoma (undeadly, just annoying skin cancer), and takes chemo drugs. Also more than a decade ago he had a mechanical heart valve replacement and he had a heart attack during surgery. Maybe it damaged his brain, and that’s why he acts the way he does? I know he’s probably mentally sick but at this point I have no sympathy for him. He abused me over the dumbest things. Like I mentioned, he is obsessed with saving money. He never heats or cools the house (California summers are hell) and when he caught me turning the AC on he screamed in my face “I’m the boss of you, you fucking bitch!” Another time when I was 14, he punched me in the face because I was crying from worrying about a test. He’d push me, kick me, pin me to a wall, He’s called me ugly, fat, stupid, worthless, crazy, mentally ill, fucked up, bitch, etc. a year ago I asked him why he calls me a bitch. He said in a mean tone “Because you have mennal illness.” (He says “mental” like “mennal”). He also calls my mom and sister a bitch, and he has sexist rants about “Why are three females dominating me? Back then men were in charge!” And he says “But I’m the man of the house!” My mom ignores me whenever I tell her that he abused me. I think she’s afraid of divorce and losing money or maybe she’s afraid of being alone even though this fucker makes me want to end myself. Trust me, I’ve tried talking to her about it. She told me he wasn’t always like this...so does that rule out The autism diagnosis?

I had an eating disorder at 14, was very underweight, and I didn’t have a period for a year. Years later when I gained weight and became healthier (5”4, 125 lbs) He encouraged me to lose weight. He said “Don’t you wanna be like that? Not having a period?” He’s dumb.

On my 10th birthday when my mom bought me an American Girl Doll (costs about 100+ dollars) he was in his room, saw the receipt, and literally screamed at the top of his lungs for a good 30 minutes. And I mean SCREAMING. just unintelligible demonic yelling. I had been obsessed with American girl for years before my mom got me that doll. I was always playing with my friends dolls and looking through the AG catalog. It was supposed to be a special gift and he ruined it. I never played with that doll because of that. He obsessively checks everyone’s receipts. He has had public freakouts over items being “too expensive.” When I was 12 I wanted to see a movie with my friend and her parents, and my dad freaked the fuck out because of the “expensive movie tickets” and stayed and waited in the car the whole time. Another time when I was 10 he rented a movie for one dollar and if you lose the film you have to pay 8 dollars for the film. So one time my friend was over and my sister accidentally misplaced the movie and he screamed and cursed at her “you better fucking find it!” My friend asked me “what is wrong with your dad?” 

Gross: he never flushes the toilet or washes his hands to “save money.” He is disgusting. And he only takes showers at the gym. 

I guess a pro about him is that he has a strict daily routine and wakes up at 4 am every morning to exercise (damn I wish I had that motivation, I probably would if he wasn’t in my life). And then he spends most of the day cleaning. But if anyone interrupts his routine he flips out. When I was 13 I made an art piece of a portrait of a girl and I guess I made the forehead too big because he mocked it and said “ET, ET.” His responses are short and stupid. 

He also exhibits sexually inappropriate behavior. One time when I was 16 and having dinner with my mom and sister, my dad was a few feet away from us and while he was making a sandwich he vigorously humped the kitchen counter, and my sister noticed and said in an irritated voice, “Papa what are you doing why are you humping the counter that’s gross.” And he just kept going and he said in a defensive voice “I’M DANCEN!” (I’m dancing) And just kept going. And my mom said “No, stop.”


(Trigger warning? Possible child abuse?) To preface this next part, I don’t know what the hell happened in this situation, but when I told a therapist about it she called a social worker to come to the house. When I was a 4 year old He used to walk around the house in his tidy whities a lot, and he’d play this game called “the scissors” and he’d put me between his legs and close them tightly so I couldn’t escape and I yelled for my mom and she would just tell him to stop without questioning wtf was going on. 
He knew I hated it but he kept doing that stupid “scissors” game. Idk wtf that was.

I know most people will say I’m an adult, I should get a job now and save up and move out. Trust me I wanna do that, depression is kicking my ass lately. I can barely function and do my homework. I hope medical ketamine will have effect on my depression. I am trying to eat healthy and exercise. I am also trying to work on college apps, I want to go to an art school and stay in the dorms. Hopefully I’ll get accepted to an art school. My friend’s family has roommates, and maybe I’ll ask if I can rent a room (I’ll have to share a tiny bedroom with 3 other people but maybe that’s worth it to be away from my dad) There are many things I can do about the stress of the situation. I just want to know what the hell is wrong with him. Life would be so much easier if he was dead. I hope he has a brain tumor. Ngl, I’m not that religious or anything, but every day I pray that he will die today. We have life insurance, I won’t be on edge anymore and I’d honestly be much better mentally and physically. I know, I’m an asshole. Please, answer away. Thank you...",1583875991.0,mental_disorder

Before i type anything out, just a warning that the post will contain stuff related to self harm and mental disorder. So, please proceed as per your way. (I am not good with words and often fail to express myself. Sorry for that in advance)

So, I am a 17 y/o teen from India, turning 18 soon in November. A bit of background, as a kid, i was really carefree and dumb and outgoing. I did wat i wanted without thinking twice. It had its consequences which i didnt know about back then but it did affect me later, by quite alot. I sort of gave in to my mental problems at the age of 14. My father used to NEVER talk to me unless it was about studies, which is better now cuz he atleast tries to talk to me but its still is not enough as he just thinks of himself as my father and nothing else as in a friend maybe? I am naturally cuz of that, more close to my mother, which i love but now i am starting to hate it too. I have social anxiety now and i am a full introvert with almost no social skills. Its hard to make new friends and the fear of losing the ones i have now is always keeping me on the edge. I did, however, lost a really old friend of mine cuz of one stupid lie i told him.... I regret it still now cuz its hardly been a month since that happen. I started talking to one other friend of mine and he kept me sane through out the whole time. But cuz of that lie i lost a grp of friends. I have trust issues, i dont even trust myself. I always need someone to like babysit me with whatever i do. And cuz of that, being 18, being an adult is scaring me. I have eating disorder and prolly ADHD but i am not diagnosed for either of them cuz mental health in most of the places is not regarded as a real illness and is seen as something that lowers u in the eyes of ur surrounding people. And in India, people dont consider anything else as a mental disorder other than depression, as in if its not depression, its NOT a mental disorder. It goes to my parents as well which is why i dont bring up these two topics with them. I also feel guilty when someone around me goes through the same shit as me but i cant help them cuz i cannot help myself. It always leaves me regret on how i could have helped them or myself if i did this or that. I got man things going in my mind but i cannot express them in words alone cuz its just, too hard for me. I cannot express myself properly at all or my problems at that. So i never know what is truly wrong with me.

I have decided, to end it all on my birthday, which is 4 months from now on. The fear of death and the face of my mother crying over my body is trully horrifying to even think about. I dont even know if anyone else except her would care about me being dead so i will just put an end to it all. My mom got my little brother so she will not be sad for long time as well. I just hope that if there are people like me, dont be like me. Seek help from friends, family, anyone. I know i shudnt be the one to say that here but there is always a shining light in the end of the tunnel. Find our shining light. I got none so i will leave this place to find it in another life maybe. Its still scaring me to even think of, what comes after death.

thats all i guess. i got much more to say but i dont know how so i will keep it till that. If u read it, thanks for your time.

I just need to put this out into the ether I guess. I really am having troubles going on. Its too long of a story to go over for what feels like the ten thousandth time this week, but to sum it up, I'm the father of a 14 year old kid who's own depression, anxiety, and mental disorders (borderline personality disorder) has caused a complete colapse of my relationship with my partner. I've stuck with my partner through thick and thin over the last year, but my child's sociopathic behaviors have proven too much, and she has her five year old to think about. Yes my child has been diagnosed, but getting the kid to accept help is incredibly difficult.  


So now I'm here, alone with my kid, trying to get her help, and she's just gone. And no one's called me to see how i'm doing. I cant afford anything so I need to get a second job. I'll have to work 14-16 hour days just to make ends meet. I'm alone. I feel abandoned by everyone. Meanwhile she's got an extensive family, some significant wealth saved up, so she can afford to go. I've got no money. No time. No support. I'm supposed to care for myself and this sociopathic teenager of mine, and I don't know how? I'm just so overwhelmed.  


I keep looking through all these suicide help lines and I keep thinking about how I can't handle calling them. I don't want their bullshit platitudes. ""Oh, its so tough what you're going through. You're so strong for calling and seeking support."" I don't want any of that. I just want it to be over. And what happens after I get off the phone. No like they can do anything. It just goes back to being the same as soon as I hang up. Like I said, I don't know why i'm posting here. I don't expect anything. I just need to get this out of my head. Everything has collapsed, and no one's reached out to see that I'm doing okay, because i'm not. I'd go to the hospital and check myself in, but then I get the anxiety that I'll lose my job, and then I'll lose my house and how do I take care of my kid then?  I can't afford to stay at the hospital. There's no answers, theres no solutions.

I wish I wasnt like this. I wish I didn’t have to be such a fucking burden to everyone. I’m 17 and I’m a pathetic excuse of a human being.

I try so hard to love myself but it’s so glaringly obvious that I’m a disappointment to my friends, my family and everyone else.

When I came out as gay last year my dad stopped asking or caring about my romantic life. I wish I was different.

When I was younger my old step family used to bully me and honestly I deserved it. I held everyone back and ruined everyone’s fun. My mum was right when she said I ruined Christmas when I was 7. I couldn’t control my anxiety and it annoyed everyone too much. I ruined a holiday because I was too scared to get on the plane after 1 bad plane ride with turbulence. I’m such a coward.

My mum said I was the cause of her mental issues when I was like 12 and I feel so guilty. Why the fuck do I have to have anxiety and mental issues. I also held her back when she wanted to date again after my old stepdad cheated and left her because I was scared that men would assault her. I used to stay up all night crying because I could hear her having sex and be drunk. I hated it but it just shows how I ruin people’s lives. 

I’m autistic and feel like an alien. I don’t fit in with anyone.

I don’t want to feel sorry for myself, I just feel so sick and tired of the pathetic failure I am. My friends are getting ready for university next year while im at home rotting and trying to find a job. I’m too mentally ill to do everything they are doing. I have depression, panic disorder, autism and anxiety. 

I thought I was ok with my sexuality but I hate it so much. I feel nothing but envy and shame. I resent others for just being happy. I seriously don’t deserve love.

I want to be the best version of myself I can be, and I try and be kind, but I feel so miserable and ashamed constantly for still breathing. I get therapy twice a month but it doesn’t help. They just worm their way around the problems. I can’t change therapist either.

How many times have i motivated myself, convinced myself, made attempts to improve my life one way or another. Whether it was something big like staying at a job for more then a damn month (if i could even make it that far) or something small like attempting to talk to strangers. I would have hope that I'll get somewhere. That I'll be a changed man but then some bullshit will happen and I'll give up. 

To be frank when i was 9 i was convinced to my core that i was going to kill myself at 24. 
I had no premise for that. All i knew at the time was that i had gcse to worry about. I couldnt even see myself at 20. 
Told my mother and she thought its all in my head. Fast forward today, im 24 and lemme tell u i feel like a fucking prophet and im not happy about it. 

I'll admit i give up easily heck sometime i give up before giving it a shot because i dont want to do it or that its pointless. Like for example never done my homework as a teen. Never. Becuase i didnt want to do it. Rarely studied and even then it would last 10/15 min since i didnt like it. Yet i think its misunderstood that im not trying or making effort. At some point i just safely assumed my best is simply nothing for everyone else. Added in with the fact i have a ego that crumbles the more i interact with people and u'll get someone who cant stand being in a job. 

Self aware enough to know my flaws yet fully aware that i have no intention of doing anything about it. At some point i questioned if i was leading myself to a predeterminded path that i place on myself as a child but no. If theres one thing i can trust myself in, its that i would never place harm to myself. Even if i had a clone i know it wouldnt try to hurt me nor would i. 

Im going off topic i think. Im going to die at 24 from my own effort. Tried to stop that from being true. Even thought that maybe I'll be a changed man thats why I'll be dead ha. Hope leads to despair. No matter how many times it happens i somehow think i have a chance if i do what everyone else can already do. Staying at a job.
Im not going to lie, im writing this at my workplace when im suppose to still be working. Its my third day working. I dont plan on coming back after this is done. And its stupid because i was mentally prepared this time. I expected all the things that i thought would have to happen and it did. I had other choices for a job but i refused to deal with customer ontop of the co workers and boss.  I dont have the luxury to fall back on someone for support so this is all i have either. YET i cannot for the life of me plan to stay here for even another week let alone another hour.

 If ur not social, if u dont have connections, if u dont have any goals or ambition and if u dont have a great dad. Ur fighting life on hell mode. Doublely so if ur taking the piss with ur own life like me.  

My saving grace is that im still a virgin. Im actually glad to know that even if i feel like my life is fucked. At the very least i didnt have to deal with a messed up relationship.
My only regrets is that i couldnt finish xenoblade 3 because i felt so stressed. 
Maybe i really am depressed afterall and ive just been in denial. Not like that would have changed the outcome. 
To be honest the support i would need requires a brand new life with a brand new save file haha. Its fucked up.

Most of the time I just read through posts. I know that a lot of us on here are suffering, hoping for someone to talk to while we stand here on the brink of oblivion- and I’ll internalize it. This is the pain we’ve all felt for such a long time and It leaves me to think about my own life and actions.

I’m twenty two years old. I dropped out of college after having a mental breakdown at 19. It was a culmination of coming to grips with being groomed by someone I trusted in my teens, a toxic on again/off again relationship with my Ex, coming to grips with my lack of sexuality and how many people didn’t believe Demisexuality to be a thing, as well as manipulation of someone I saw as a friend.

I made my last attempt on my life. In my car, but I was so terrified of hurting someone else with my original plan that I returned home and turned off the lights.

I overdosed and no one in my family did anything about it. Didn’t take me to a hospital. Just, MAYBE checked on me. I joke about it sometimes. Oh! My longest ever nap was a week and a half! LOL!!!! And they joke about my sloth vice as well. But I don’t think they know about the circumstances. And if they do…

I didn’t do anything about it. After I woke up I hid the note. And for years I let my mental state break more and more, until I went to therapy.

And I wasn’t entirely truthful- nor did I complete my therapy sessions.

I dropped it because I didn’t want to discuss my mom and how she might be a player in my issues. The emotional incest and spousification. How my bio-fathers abandonment and token attempts at seeing me actually furthered my abandonment issues. Or how my step father’s comments had actually broken me. I didn’t want to face the truth.

Then came 2020, the fights, the pandemic, the threats, glimmer of freedom only to lose it, and recently… my being thrown out. Only to be ALLOWED back once family noticed.

I’ve come to realize that… I can’t ignore the lines on The wall anymore. This life isn’t right for me. I need a plan for the future if I hope of finding inner peace. And I’m so close.

Recently I learned that I finish my AA degree in august. Then I plan on transferring out of state (or at least farther away) and moving into my own home. I’ll finally be able to put space between myself and my family’s fighting. and allow myself the chance to grow into myself. I secretly plan on changing my degree towards a history degree. Without the added teaching component my mother’s husband is obsessed with me having. Then I plan on graduating, finding a job, and settling down.

I don’t see myself in a romantic relationship but I do want to have kids by the time I’m thirty. Adoption or a Sperm donor seem like a fine alternative. But who knows.

63,721.0,No path for my life exists that isn't pure misery and despair - why keep walking it?,9,vrdonc,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vrdonc/no_path_for_my_life_exists_that_isnt_pure_misery/,0,"I'm really, really struggling to see the path that leads from where I am now, to actually being happy. Or at least, being *not* miserable. If such a path doesn't exist, if I really am ""destined"" to be miserable the rest of my life...why even bother walking such a path?  

I am honestly just so ... sad. All the time. Loneliness has consumed my life and my thoughts. I'm at work with a pile of tasks that I have no intention of doing anytime soon. All I can think of is how daunting the rest of my life is right now. Because I can see it clearly. Another 30-40 years of getting up, going to work, coming home to an empty house, eating dinner, playing video games (until arthritis and carpal tunnel catch up to me, then just watching movies), then going to sleep to do it all over again. The weekends just remove work from the equation. That's all my life has been the last 5-8 years, that's all it will be until I die.  

Why do I not only think this, but absolutely *know* it, with every fiber of my being? Quite simply, because there's no way anything else is possible. I know myself well enough to know I will never have the motivation, discipline, or sheer willpower to change anything about my life. The ability to force myself to work out, or change careers, or make friends was bullied out of me at a very young age. What few friends stuck around are long gone. The only people that remain in my life are biologically programmed to do so. Once they are gone, I will have no one, until the day I die.  

So what do I do now? To say my future sounds bleak is a gross understatement of affairs. How am I supposed to move forward knowing that the ONE thing that I've always wanted, the ONLY thing I've *ever* wanted - to be loved, cared for, hugged and kissed, to have my hand clasped in my lovers' - has never been, and never will be, possible? That no matter how many strangers I try to talk to, no matter how many MeetUp groups I attend, no matter how many jobs I start and lose because of my poor work ethic, I will never make another *friend,* let alone a partner?",1656958621.0,despair

The media is literally packed with sentimental and grand talks about the achievements of these young people and what exciting possibilities the future has for them etc. There's also concerned speculation about how corona restrictions have been affecting the spirits and mental health of the youth - They are the future, after all, and fragile important creatures!

I'm post-college of six years. I usually don't care about the high school graduation hype, about 95% of people graduate in my country so it's not that big of an achievement really, more of a rite of passage. I've thought it's mostly about older people reminiscing their own youth or parents sentimental about their kids growing up, not to mention teens thinking their every single grade has some sort of deep effect on their life.

But this year I just got pissed, then sad, then pissed again. What future, what exciting opportunities? Did I miss it somehow? It's been nothing but misery and rejection and struggle and numbness for me, and not for lack of effort on my part. I look at these kids (i.e. myself as a young person) and think how naive they are, how they have no idea what abyss lies ahead of them. Then I remember, hey, these are normal people and not sad losers like me. They will dream of becoming veterinarians and engineers and lawyers and they'll do just fine. They won't become suicidal by the age of 30 after a string of meaningless and straining minimum wage part time jobs.

Then I think about the general concern over these young graduates. I feel ashamed, as if nobody is really concerned about me and I don't somehow deserve it. After you go to college and graduate it's all just silent lonely struggle. You are expected to succeed, or fail in silence. You lack the security of older people and the protection aimed at younger people. You are nothing, no one.

I have been suicidal and depressed for 10 years and have decided life just is not for me. I know how selfish this is but I can’t help it. I am so self destructive that I can no longer continue existing with my own character. I can’t keep living with my own thoughts, in my own head. 

The scariest part is I know all the things I need to do to improve my situation but I won’t do them. I won’t exercise, self care, eat healthy, socialise, meditate, get a job/go to school. It’s like I deliberately do it to torture myself because I hate myself so much. I want to want to help myself but I dont. Or at least not enough for it to equate to action . Day after day goes by and I tell myself it will be the day I start to take care of myself but I can’t muster it. This has been going on for 6 months now.  I’ve been trying to stop, to just take action but it’s not happening. 

I have been in the mental healthcare system for all of the ten years, the first time I was hospitalised for an attempt I was 15. My family have always been very supportive, including financially, of me and my mental illness. Years of therapy, psychiatric care.
I plan to go by nitrogen exit. I’m terrified. But ultimately it’s what I want to do.

My biggest pain is knowing my mother will be left with no real strong support system. My family moved to the country I live at now 8 years ago and we have no other family here, my mother is a very independent person who likes being solo so hasn’t made any intimate friends.  My father passed three years ago from cancer and my one younger sister moved away to Canada a year ago. 

I know that my actions will cause them incredible grief for some time. My biggest fear is that it will have the kind of impact on them in the way my mental illness has on me (traumatising them lasting years and years and years). My fathers death was heartbreaking for us all but eventually, slowly we healed and my mom and sisters spirits lifted again, they found themselves and happiness and peace again. I’m afraid suicide will have a different effect somehow. I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t. I hope it’s just narcissistic of me to think so.",1573571998.0,despair

I've battled depression for around 8 years now since I was young, around the age of 12. I'd matured quickly and have had issues understanding why I should bother living - the point of life, or whatever. I've had lots of thoughts and a single close call of suicide in the past.

For years I've been improving my mindset about things and trying to think more positively. Even a prospect of going to uni later this year despite being in a pandemic.

Everything has come crashing down recently as I realised something fundamentally important to a successful life. The height of a male.

Anyone reading this will probably think it's petty and an almost trivial reason to off yourself. However, I find myself to be in a very dangerous position because of it. I've always had the mindset that I can correct or fix something. But this is obviously not the case and it's fucking vexing. I've never felt so irrationally angry in my life. I guess it's because it's out of my control that it's so frustrating.

I've had serious thoughts about ending my life over it. All my role models, every single male, friend, hell even most women tower over me. The feeling of insignificance, weakness and not feeling like a developed man has haunted me these past couple years. Yet I had hope for growing taller, and thus waited patiently. Going on 21 now I can safely say that it's finished. Was probably finished at 18. Nothing could have prepared me for this ultimate diabolical hell that is living life as a short man.

The only thing that brings me respite is knowing that there are people out there with worse birth defects, diseases or issues. And that I should be grateful for being healthy, at least physically.

Honestly, I'm scared of the future. It truly does not bode well and I can say with 100% certainty that I am at my wits' end.

68,749.0,Considering suicide more out of laziness than despair. ,29,i2jun,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i2jun/considering_suicide_more_out_of_laziness_than/,20,"More and more, I feel like I'm just not cut out to be an adult. 

I'm 28 years old. I'm mostly self-sufficient. I've got a job pays decently well (though I have to do freelance and will probably need a third job on top of that), I live in my own apartment, I cook for myself, and mainly do all the things people are supposed to do in order to maintain their lives. 

It's soul crushing. I've already made the decision that if I were suddenly to find myself in a life threatening situation, I wouldn't fight it. I want a bus to careen off the road and hit me. I want to be struck by lightning. I want to have a sudden, fatal heart attack. I want to just not have to be alive anymore. 

Everything costs money. Food costs money. Rent costs money. Electricity costs money. The simple act of being alive, it seems, costs money. Being alive, living, is an effort. A huge effort. It's not a default state but something that must be consciously maintained. You have to eat. You have to have shelter. You have to go to the dentist. You 
have to go to the doctor. And these all take time and cost money. There are no alternatives. Capitalism won the Cold War. This is society. This is the way things are done. This is LIFE. 

And Communism was no walk in the park either, at any rate. 

We work to get money. We wake up. Brush our teeth. Put on a tie, unless it's casual Friday. Run to catch the train. Elbow some guy in the gut because there's not a lot of room and you need your 1.5x1.5 square. We get to work. Get our coffee. Do something we hate. Something that goes completely and utterly against our principles. It's like a Jew working at a pork processing plant. But the money's good. You're not in college anymore. It's time to put all that idealism away. It's time to be an adult. You're not getting any younger. Do this. All day. Every day. Until you die. 

Life is full of worries. That project needs to be completed by Friday. That freelance assignment needs to be done by Monday. You've got to call the exterminator and get these silverfish out of your bathroom. And these are just your immediate worries. Meanwhile, oppression is happening on a mass scale all over the world. You directly benefit from it. In fact, part of your job is contributing to it. In a small part. But still a part. How did this happen? How did this become your life? 

Other people deal with it. You're not so self absorbed as to think that you're the only one suffering. You're not so naive to think you have it so bad. You live in a first world nation. You can get clean water whenever you want. You eat every day. You're comparatively healthy (though, you do smoke a lot...) What makes you different? Why can't you just accept what millions, billions, already accept? Why can't you just work for a living and like it? You entitled little shit. You're exactly what's wrong with America. Everyone works. You hate your job? So does every god damn fucking person in the world. THEY don't wanna die. Why do you? 

Because it's like a light switch going off in your head. One minute you're here. The next you're not. And all your problems vanish. You vanish. It doesn't matter that you've worked as hard as you can but you can't complete that project. It doesn't matter that your freelance assignments have dried up. It doesn't matter that you need to find a third god damn job on top of the two you already have. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Because you're dead. You don't have to worry about anything. Life is no longer happening to you. There's no need for decisions. No need for stress. No need for work. There's not even a need for a burial plot -- you don't care what happens to your body. Let some necrophiliac carve your corpse full of brand new orifices for all you care. 

You don't have to worry. About anything. 

Change jobs? God, even MORE fucking work. Sure, you can do it, but it's so much effort. Scouring jobs boards, going to networking events, writing cover letters, it's all so much much work. And you'll still be miserable. It's not the specific job. It's jobs in general. It's life in general. It's responsibilities in general. There will always be something that grinds you into dust. One leg gets tired, so you shift your weight until the other leg gets tired and then you shift your weight again over and over and over. I just want to sit down, but everyone else is standing. I'm just fucking lazy. Things that come easy to others is an arduous task for me. Getting out of bed, even, depresses me because I know it will be yet another day full of soul crushing responsibility. I'm not so entitled to think I deserve to not have to do with every god damned person does. But, still, I'd really rather not. I don't want to have to take care of myself. I don't want other people to take care of me. 

So: death. 

I don't know what, exactly, I hope to accomplish by this post. I only intended to write a paragraph or two and everything just came pouring out. I've been thinking these thoughts for years. I've never shared them with anyone. To outside observers, I'm the most cheerful fucking guy in the world. But I'm rotting like a soft log in a shallow pond, from the inside out. And one day. I'll split. 

tl;dr -- life is too much effort to maintain, so I've been considering giving it up. ",1308353627.0,despair
69,752.0,21 and Despairing,2,370pjy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/370pjy/21_and_despairing/,4,"I’m a twenty-one year old male, still living with my parents. I’ve been dealing with depression and social anxiety/phobia for about six to seven years now. I’ve considered suicide many times in the past, but only recently have I started thinking about how I’d carry it out. I’ve chosen my method, but instinctual fear is still preventing me from doing it for now. I want to get help more than anything, but my anxiety prevents me from doing so.

(I apologize for the following wall of text, but there’s a lot I want to say.)

I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high-school due to the schools around my area being rather trashy, so I didn’t get to socialize with kids my own age until I was a teenager and got more involved in my hobbies. I eventually lost interest in my hobbies due to the depression. Or maybe I was never interested in them to begin with and I was only faking interest because of my parents insistence that I do something other than sit on my computer all day, I don’t know anymore. Nowadays I don’t have any friends that I keep in touch with other than my group of online friends who I’ve been gaming with since early adolescence. I should also mention I’m addicted to video games to some extent, probably because it’s the only social outlet I have left.

I’m also a perfectionist; I can’t handle any sort of rejection, criticism, or anything negative from another person without feeling crushed to the point of wanting to kill myself. If I do something wrong and somebody points it out to me, even if they only mean to help me, I immediately fall into a crushing depressive episode. It can be the smallest, most insignificant thing in the world, and I’ll make up a reason to immediately abandon whomever I’m with at the time just so I can sulk by myself.

The biggest problem is that I’ve never been able to express these feelings to anybody, not even my parents. They can be judgmental and extremely difficult to talk to, and I’ve had some really bad experiences with them in the past regarding my feelings, especially my father. It was around the time my social anxiety and depression really started taking control of my life, so whether there’s a connection there or not, I don’t know. No matter how much I want to get help, I just can’t get myself to tell them about my problems, just because I’m terrified of how they’d react and that I might make my situation worse.

(For what it’s worth, I *have* discussed my issues with two of my online friends, but they can only help me so much when they have their own lives to live and are thousands of miles away.)

Before I graduated high school, people constantly asked when I was going to get my driver’s license. I passed the paper exam, got my learner’s permit, (which expired last year sometime I think, so I’ll probably have to take it *again,*) but simply never went back to take the actual driving exam due to my anxiety.

Once I graduated high school, people asked me what I was going to college for. Of course, I had no intentions of going to college; I planned on being dead by the time I turned twenty-one, but I went with it at the time. I said, “Oh, Iunno, I’ll figure it out,” or something to that effect. By the looks on their faces, you would think I’d just admitted to murdering innocent children. Their insinuations were clear as day: “Go to college or get a job, or you’re a loser.” I’d like to think these are just cognitive distortions of mine, but once again, I *know* these people. They *are* generally unpleasant people, (to put it gently,) but even though I reminded myself that, I wanted to hang myself every time I heard that question anyway, and I heard it almost daily for at least a year. I couldn’t handle that kind of pressure, and so I withdrew.

My withdrawal from society and procrastination after high school really put me into a slump. How am I supposed to live like this? Getting older terrifies me, and is one of the reasons the scales are tipping toward suicide more and more every day. I can’t stand looking at myself in the mirror. I have no control over this, and it frustrates me to no end that I can’t shake this feeling that I’m running out of time. I want to do things with my life but I just can’t find the strength to do it.

I’d probably try to pursue a career in writing, but I can’t pursue it because of my fears of being criticized. I’d probably be able to manage college if I was able to get psychological help, but because I’m not independent, there’s no way I can get psychological help without my parents’ approval, and I can’t get my parents approval without talking to them about it. And even if I do bite the bullet and talk to them about it, there’s a chance they might invalidate my feelings and deny me my help, and then I’d have to deal with the aftermath of my parents not handling things properly.

Like I said, my parents are somewhat old-school and closed-minded; they stigmatize the hell out of everything. They say psychologists are nothing more than scam-artists trying to get money from you, people who take anti-depressants or other medications are pathetic, etc.

I’m afraid if I expose my feelings, they might try to kick me out in some kind of ‘tough love’ act in the hopes that it would force me to ‘get over it’ or something, when it would probably only result in tragedy. If I told them “I’m going to kill myself,” they would probably reply with something like “People who kill themselves never say that, they just do it,” or something equally ignorant. Of course, I don’t *know* if something like that would happen, but their track record with this kind of thing is terrible. It seems like every day I start mustering up strength to tell them, I’m reminded in some way of why it might just be the death of me. I just get the feeling that they’re going to fall into denial about it or take the tough love approach, just because they can’t have an unstable son. They care more about me being socially acceptable than my mental well-being. It would be *embarrassing* for them.

On the flip side, I believe my parents do love me as much as they’ve said they do. I know they would never intentionally harm me, but I just don’t think they would understand what I’m going through due to their closed-mindedness, and may react in a potentially destructive way toward me.

Financially, my family is well-off, and my parents plan to pay for my college, but of course, I can’t do anything with it because of my issues, which is the most frustrating part. I have all the opportunity and yet no will to grasp it.

So, my life has devolved into an awful cycle of wanting to try and get help and gain independence, deciding the risks aren’t worth the reward, and then contemplating suicide until I fall asleep. When I wake up, it all starts over. The only time I feel at peace is when I’m dreaming. When I’m forced into social situations, I fake happiness – and after six years, I’ve gotten damn good at it, too.

But I’m tired of faking it. I want out of this. And I will get out, one way or another.

This has led me to bottle up my emotions for a long time. 

One day I realized how close I was to killing myself, and part of my healing process is writing.  

Here is one of those stories.  


Depression

There was a boy.  By fortune of his birth, he was born at a time of never before seen prosperity, in a place some say was taken, but was now protected by a brave few who were willing to sacrifice for their own for the whole. 

“See?” The gods said quietly, seeing as he was a quiet child, and gently for the same reason.  

He was raised by the similarly fortunate who taught him the importance of work ethic, the need for personal responsibility, and the power of unconditional love. 

“See?”

He was blessed with a large family which let him experience the Love of others.  

“See?”

He was provided a story book childhood, with Mothers, Fathers, Grandparents, Brothers, Sisters, Aunt’s, Uncles, Pastors, Friends and even animals who loved him.

“See?”

But there was another voice, also quietly, but not so kindly.  And more nagging. 

“Why you?”

He excelled academically -“Usually”- because of teachers whose passion and Love let them better understand the complexities of what it means to be human.

“See.”

He was taught the miracles of the natural world, and the usefulness of creation. 

“See.”

He grew this way, with challenges- “screw-ups”-but with few struggles - “coward!”

“See.”

Within him, seemingly inexplicably grew a lack of Love for himself -“ingrate!”

“See.”

With young adult hood came a shocking understanding of how -“worthless”-the world could be.

“Evil is everywhere.”

That naturally brought questions -“fool”-about why things were they way they were.

“If not us, the other will rule with cruelty and lies.”

His religion -“its a crutch”- gave him answers through genuine Love, compassion, and interest in his growth as good, honest, and beneficial member of their society.  

“There is no other way.”

But, he also learned the price for disbelief was eternal torment in the underworld. 

“Which you deserve for your sins.”

He saw war, famine, greed and hatred running amock in the world beyond the mountains, even though he -“coward!”- remained safe.  

“It will come for you!  Only I can save you.”

He wondered why would the gods allow such suffering.  How they can claim perfectly unconditional Love when they allow the sickness in the world-“they don’t care”.

But the sickness was incurable, and he felt helpless -“weak.”

The nagging voice grew louder, and drowned out all others.  

It made him forget what he was supposed to see. 

His self loathing -COWARD!”- grew with his despair.  

But, despite the seemingly ever-present sickness, he prospered -“took!”- and even found Love.

“See.” Still as quiet and as gentle as ever.  

He married the most beautiful and selfless woman in the infinitely massive universe -“you can’t understand”- and was blessed with a child, the kind also only heard of in story books -“you aren’t ready.”

With relatively few mistakes, he grew in experience and skill, and was able to use to his abilities to be the man he was supposed to be -“you never earned it.”

But his despair also grew -“YOU ARE WEAK!”- until one day he decided to end his life. 

“See?”

As he stood by the cliff he asked himself:

“Why am I here?”

“There is no reason!” The voice said. “You have failed, and you will fail them too.”

“See?”

“You are sick. They will be better off without you!”

“See?” The same quiet and gentle voice was back.  

“Step off.  Your worries will die with you.”

“Stop.”

“See.”

“What am I supposed to see?” He begged!

“Pain? Suffering? Cruelty? Death?” He sneered.  “I see them every day, and I am to weak and foolish to stop them from destroying my world!”

“Them.” In that familiar gentle voice. “Your wife. Your Child.”

“HOW COULD THEY LOVE YOU! JUMP!”

“See them? Your Mother? Your Father?”

“YOU FAILED THEM! JUMP!”

“See them.”  It was never actually a question. 

“Your Brothers. Your Sisters.”

“YOU TREATED THEM LIKE DIRT! JUMP!”

“See them.”

“Your Aunts. Your Uncles.”

“YOU DIDN’T EVEN KNOW THEM! JUMP!”

“See them.”

“Your Friends.  Everyone you know.”

“IF THEY KNEW YOU, THEY WOULD HATE YOU TOO! JUMP!”

“See.”

“HA.”  The voice laughed.  “YOU ARE TOO COWARDLY TO EVEN LOVE YOURSELF!”

“NOW STOP BEKNG A COWARD! JUMP!” It hissed malevolently.  

“See.”

“You were there all along.”

“Forgive yourself.  You are Loved and forgiven without condition.  You must Love yourself the same, so you can Love others.”

“LIES!” The voice seemed weaker.  

“Look and See.”

He opened his eyes and saw his wife and child.  He finally truly saw the way they Loved him, and it was more beautiful than the sunrise!

“I See! I SEE!  How did I miss this, when it was here all along?”

“BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL WEAK!”

“See.” 

The Love he had ignored for so long coursed through him, and he wept as he turned from the ledge.  

“See.”

“THERE IS NO HOPE!  YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME!  THE SICKNESS IS TOO STRONG!”

“Keep looking.  It’s there to see, as long as you are willing to look.”

He began walking and kept Seeing more, but the screaming voice was still there.  

“See.”

“LOVE IS WEAKNESS!  IT HAS NO POWER!”

“See.”

Fear would find ways to explain away what he was seeing, but the quiet voice remained. 

“See.”

Again, he decided he must die, so he began killing himself.  

It was a slow and painful process.  

The part of himself that he was killing didn’t want to die.

It bit and thrashed like a wild animal with its foot in a snare.  

It took constant effort, and constant refocusing, but the Love he saw filled him, and allowed him to push on. 

This took away fear’s power, but slowly.  

Sometimes the fear rushed back with renewed strength, hissing wildly, and at times nearly toppling his newly built defenses. 

But now, they were tall enough that he could see past the attack. 

“Now you See.” The quiet voice said in it’s unfaltering tone.  

“If you keep looking, you will See through every moment, good and bad, beautiful and hopeless, painful and horrific, and you will find it.”

As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

Strive to be happy.

I understand that I have it better off than those in poverty but living in wealth with no need to work for anything has been a miserable existence that has left me suicidal.


My family is what you would consider nouveau riche, with my father being raised in lower middle class and making everything by himself.


But rather than pass his drive and grit he has done nothing but overwhelm me with excess. As a teenager I used to be more introverted and would prefer to stay in and play minecraft rather than go out, this confused him and he pushed me to go out, spend money in clubs and restaurants with his friends kids and enjoy a life of excess. 
I guess I understand where he is coming from, never having had any of this I guess he wanted to give me all he never had.


But after years of unlimited credit cards, expensive habits, and substance usage, I find myself at 24 with absolutely no drive.


Why would I work? I have a credit card that I can get anything with, a nice car that takes me anywhere, for fucks sake I even have maids that clean up my room so I don't have the basic skill of organizing my surroundings.

I am now the stereotypical loser living with their parents. No job. No life. No happiness.

The crazy thing about suicide is that rarely does it come out of the blue.   It's a buildup of a lot of stuff.  
I wouldn't say all of this is my fault. The job market and economy is crap. I could work minimum wage again, but honestly when you have nothing to look forward to this is what happens.  America has gotten rough.

Take this story as a cautionary tale. Get help when you are younger. The older you get, the harder it is to change your thought patterns. Depression and Anxiety got to me, and have won. 30 years ago they didnt have the treatment and awareness they have now.  There is hope for you younger adults.

Too late for me. I screwed up too many times. While my classmates got married and rose up the ladder, I kept pace until 6 months ago.  Life throws curveballs like this, but it knocked me down and frankly nobody cares. I got left in the dust by my friends. My parents pity me while my siblings have great lives. The worse part about being suicidal is people filling you with false hope so you will shut up and leave them alone.

I had some good times, some bad times, and sad times in life. But depression and anxiety won the war while I won some battles. I did the best I could.

I hope that this can help someone so they dont end up like me.  Work hard, listen to your peers, dont burn bridges. Get therapy and medication right away if yoh are struggling.  Don't end up like me. Dying is tragic but having a really pathetic life before dying is even worse.

I stabbed myself in kindergarten because I didn't have any hesitations in the concept of harming myself and I felt no positive emotions. Another little kid jokingly told me they would attack me (in the child make believe violence way) and my response was that I didn't care if they did. My other memories are all just constant existentialism and a feeling of disconnect towards my own emotions and experiences. I remember being on the playground and questioning the concept of free will because of a constant feeling of just going through the motions without a genuine connection to my own choices and person. I was labeled gifted for my outlook, but in all honesty it's always just been a heavy suicidality. 

I can't remember a period in my life before being suicidal. I've always wanted to die. Literally always. That's part of why I can't wrap my head around the saying that suicidal ideation is temporary, because for me it isn't. It's never once changed, it never really started anywhere and it's never seemed to end much. I'm intrinsically suicidal. My only real dreams in life are centered around dying. It feels like it's the only thing that gives me and sense of comfort.

I'm wondering now if it really just means I'm destined to die young. Every therapist I've ever seen has been stumped and every person I've ever talked to has been overwhelmed or not understanding. I honestly think I belong in a mental hospital with how absolutely insane I must sound, or be i suppose, but I honestly feel further isolation from society would only make me want to die more, and I'd rather be dead than be crazy and stuck in a mind of torturous existence. I don't think I was ever meant to exist. 

I'm honestly not sure what to do at this point because all the years I've spent searching for answers have been to no avail and I'm just really tired of living this way. I'm holding out hope that support could fix me enough to function like a normal human being, but when all my life I've been told I need to fix my own problems and that no one else can save me, I figure that considering there's no healthy way for me to exist I might as well not. I've tried absolutely everything. There's not a single piece of preexisting advice that I haven't given numerous long-standing shots.

I'm also extremely accustomed to people simply not believing me. Everything about me is an outlier and it makes it impossible to find connection in my life.

I don't want to blurt it out on social media but there is a lot of suicide and mental health issues in his family, and his eldest sister tried to take her own life in his room multiple times when he was quite young, and it has affected him significantly.

 Later into our sleepover we were laying on my bed just talking and again the conversation got very deep. He asked me if I've ever been suicidal, to which I replied yes. I'm only passively suicidal (not invalidating anyone!!) so I only touched on it briefly and we talked about that a little, then he told me how he has been depressed for so long and feels like it will never get better. He told me about how all he could think about was ending his life when we were hanging out with friends, and how he sat in the park alone for half an hour when we had all gone home. He feels extremely hopeless, mental health issues and depression runs through most of his family. He cried in my arms and told me he hasn't told anyone how he feels at all. He doesn't open up about his feelings to anyone so it was a big step for him to tell me; I think his mum knows he is depressed, but not the full extent of it. I know I should tell her but I need to find a moment to consult with my own first. After he'd gone home the following day I left him a massive goodnight paragraph telling him how much I loved him and how I couldn't bear it if he wasn't here, I said I was proud of him and he is a wonderful person and a few more things.

Mentions of alcoholism and hallucinations. Just a heads up.

I don’t even want to post this, but I guess I need advice. Look, I know this is cringe and I’m sorry. I don’t vent a lot, so this is a change of pace for me. 

I’ve always been haunted by the thoughts of killing myself, ever since I was young. I don’t think life has any meaning, honestly, and I see no reason to keep living. There’s the occasional pleasure or two, but what really is the meaning of life? Some say it’s to reproduce, some say it’s to get the big bucks, but I don’t think that. You’re here, just existing, for no real purpose. But it isn’t that bad. You can do whatever you want, I guess?

Lately, my suicidal urges have been getting worse. I don’t see myself living in a few years. I hate everything.

I keep seeing things in the corner of my eye, or just kinda straight up hallucinating. I don’t hallucinate 24/7, but I have struggled with seeing things occasionally, ever since I was around six? The most popular being spiders. I always used to hallucinate spiders. I’m not even scared of them. :-( These hallucinations can range from seeing bugs, to seeing black figures.

Oh, yeah, my sleep schedule is also fucked. It wasn’t always like this. Only started a few months ago. I only get like, four hours of sleep everyday, if I’m not pulling an all nighter. I stay up late because I find that to be the time where I can just enjoy myself, being alone.

Not to mention I have terrible anxiety, and I can’t even post anything online without being fearful, but I don’t get why I’m so anxious. I guess it’s just that I want to avoid drawing negative attention and judgement.

I hate attention. I just want to be left alone. I don’t want anyones opinion or judgement on me, and I don’t understand why. I’m avoidant. Anti social, if you will. Why do I have to go through all these insufferable interactions? 

I go out of my way to avoid talking to people. I don’t want to have to put up with bullshit arguments when I could rather be sitting in silence, doing what I like by myself. I always expect the worst, thinking I’ll get judged on by every thing I say, so I’d rather just stay quiet. Plus, people are so awkward nowadays. I have to engage first and put on this happy, extroverted facade, or I get ghosted. I’m sick of this. 

As shocking as it is, I’m a lonely teen, and I never had friends growing up. I used to get teased and bullied, because I was always a shy kid. I never really had friends, and I don’t get why. I wasn’t flat out a bad person or anything, I was just shy, and awkward. Defenceless. 

I have okay grades, I’m not that stupid. But I don’t have friends. I’m not bothered by that fact anymore. I used to be depressed about it, but I think I prefer being alone now. 

Bad home-life. My dad was a douche and an alcoholic. Not gonna talk about what he did. But, frequent arguments is what I remember from my childhood. My mom and dad split up, yadada. My entire family hates my dad, and I don’t even like calling him my father. Anyway, been through two stepdads now. Arguments, pretty much weekly. I hate having to listen to this. I’m happy I have a house and food and all that, I just wish I didn’t have to live through this anymore. I want to be left alone.

Im grateful to have found this community on Reddit and hope that I can get some god advice from some of you out there.

I, 25F, have struggled with depression my entire life. I have also spent a good part of my life working on finding happiness and being proactive in finding this on a nearly daily bases. A few years ago things were so bad, mentally, that I believed I had Borderline Personality Disorder. I have put in all sorts of work to the point that I no longer can relate to that version of myself. However, I still get spouts of very low vibrational states and clear chemical imbalances AKA depression.

Since I have worked so hard to build a suit of armor full of tips and tricks to trick myself into being happy/content, this has also lead to me being a major safe space for a lot of the people in my life. Which has ultimately resulted in me being someone that people lean on for support when they are feeling low and typically me reciting one of the many phrases I tell myself - ex: ""Everything is temporary."" ""its ok and healthy to feel."" - and listing some things I feel like might help - ex: listening to music, take a walk, distract yourself for a bit, care for your inner child, etc.. In light of my general attitude towards life, the one I have worked so hard to cultivate, I commonly refer to myself as having ""Robin Williams"" syndrome.. by this I mean that I am a lot sadder than people tend to recognize. I do not feel as though the people who come to me with their issues in mental health or suicide even recognize that I also struggle with these things. It's a delicate balance of trying to make them see that I can relate and also not make the conversation about myself.

Ultimately, I don't feel seen or like I have someone to lean on in times like this. I have some friends that bring up suicide so much that I don't even feel like I would be taken seriously if I were to explain that was how I was feeling. The power of the word has been taken away.

I can not talk to my family about this because they have never accepted my depression or anxiety as anything more than a phase. Nor do I want to put any of it on them. My mom is a single mom who struggles enough with her own loneliness and my sister is younger than me and I don't want to burden her with my issues when she's the one person in the world I really SHOULD be a support to.

I commonly find myself feeling the most existential dread while I am at work. **I am wondering if anyone has any tips for how to navigate this while at work especially when I feel like I am everyones support and do not have my own.**

When I am at home, I can simply melt into my own world and escape from these feelings. When I am at work, I become irritable and completely freeze up/overwhelmed.

**Also if anyone has any tips for being the support to others.** I want to be a safe space but I also wish that they saw that I am struggling to. Even more so, the more they talk about their struggles the more triggered I become and less able to hold it together myself.

i dont know how to sugar coat it, or if i even want to. but this urge has been around since i was very, very young. i have childhood trauma, so i dont remember much from my young years. but from what i do remember, it has always been like this. 

i dont know how to say this, so if it doesn’t make much sense im sorry. i want to kill someone. pretty straightforward, but, its not just that. i want to watch as the life leaves them. i want to see them struggle. i want to feel them scratch my arms as i strangle them, begging for me to release their throat. i want to watch blood drain from their bodies as i stab them repeatedly. i know im a terrible person for wanting this. but, i don’t really care. nothing really matters in the end, so, why would i?

i know there’s probably people here who have lost loved ones in similar ways, viewing me as a monster. i think they’re right. this is why i believe i deserve to die. im nothing but a freak. always have been, and probably always will be. i want to die, because im worthless. all i do is hurt others and myself. what type of life is that?

i could be someone so much better in my next life, if there even is one. i dont know what comes after death. thats the only reason im still here. im a coward, afraid of the inevitable.

I’m really bad at formatting i apologise. 

I don’t feel like i actually have friends. I only really have one that i regularly talk to but he lives all the way in england. I’m in Scotland in the islands and it’s so fucking isolating.

I’m 15 and i spent most of my time alone. The only person i’d consider an “irl friend” NEVER wants to hang out with me. Whenever i ask she pretends she doesn’t get the text for hours. I’d rather her just say she doesn’t want to. I just feel so drained when we speak. I tried to leave the friendship hut she made ne feel guilty when i tried so i stayed.

The friends i had this summer were all ones i met online through a cosplaying community. One of them committed suicide recently and i just feel so so upset. I couldn’t stop crying for the first few days after finding out. Even now when i think of him i start to tear up. 


Living on a little island makes everything so much harder, I want friends and i want to go and actually DO normal teenager things. I want to go bowling with my friends or  something.

I didn’t always live here i moved from the mainland. It’s so so painful to see the people i was friends with before posting on instagram that they’re hanging out together. I don’t even recognise most of the people in the pics. 

I’m queer and living in a household that isn’t accepting of me. I’m terrified every day that they’ll find me out. It will make life SO much worse. It’s going to be years before i can leave this shitty place. I dont even know how i can afford it. I’ve got a job currently and plan to get a second one to work after school when i’m 16. 

I don’t even know how to explain how i feel. I want to die but i’m too scared to try. I can’t really make any friends either. There’s less then 40 people in my year at school and they all think i’m weird. They make fun of me and i don’t know why. The friend i mentioned earlier is fairly “popular” she’s nice and pretty and gets on with eveyone. When people talk to us they’re really only talking to her. I get weird looks if i try and speak. 


I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m so tired of feeling alone and not speaking to people for days. I felt like this yesterday and told myself i wouldn’t do it and id see if i felt the same after sleeping and i do.

I'm 16 and truly thought I would've killed myself by now. I was never very good at anything starting elementary school and any passions I did have were stomped out by others i.e wanted to play music but, my parents wouldn't let me, I wanted to play baseball my parents wouldn't let me, I wanted to play chess with the locals once again my parents wouldn't let me.

I gained my freedom starting my highschool years (I.e allowed out and got a guitar) but, it wasn't really freedom. I went online for 7th grade to 9th grade and started a new 10th grade. I was lonely since I've always been pretty isolated because I was never allowed out much; for context went to a priv school before far away and I was starting at my local public school.

Well I'm an anxious mess since I've never socialized and I'm realizing now my anxiety is crippling and I can't talk to anyone and nearly cry on the rare occasions other people talk to me. So I have freedom I guess but, I can't do anything with it. I can't go out, anxiety and I'm always so drained from school I don't have time to anything I would've wanted to; I just sleep my days away


I also feel envious of everything I've missed. My old school was a religious thing so I didn't have any clubs, sports, or electives in middle school so I just feel kind of behind now. I'm also to anxious to even join any clubs or sports.

I'm in 11th grade now and everything is so much worse. I can't get through a full week since it's to overwhelming and I pretty much cry everyday in class silently. My parents are also pretty furious with me and keep asking what's wrong with me and belittling me. 

I just can't do it. I have no friends, no hobbies, no family that gives af about me. I also don't feel I have much of a future to look forward to since my grades are shit since I don't show up and can't do the work since lots of group stuff and I can't talk to anyone.

I just feel utterly hopeless. I felt this way when I was really young to but, I always figured it'd get better as I got older; I figured I'd find something or someone but, that hasn't happened and, I don't feel like it ever will since I can't even go to school how am I ever going to move out or go to college? I don't know if I even want that I don't think I even enjoy anything.

I asked her if she wanted her b day presents earlier and she said yes so I gave her some fridge magnets of famous paintings. (She had collected some of them and I knew she likes paintings)



While I was wrapping my brothers presents, my mother asks me in 'that tone' when I'll ever get a scholarship, I said I got some but didn't want to tell the amount. Then for some reason that icked her and goes into her incessant aggressive nagging how I 'never earned a cent' in my life.



Now I have fwo sibs, my older sister was the golden child so parents sent only her to a posh private high school and then fucking NYU PLUS the law school at the same univ. When we could barely afford a state univ. Sister never worked real 'part time', the had posh part times like teaching SAT class in parents' country for rich kids for *a mont*h for like over *5 grand.* My younger brother never worked a part time and now parents are paying 100% for his law school.


I am 100% on student debt which is okay since it's my 2nd time in undergrad college(fucked up grad school due to severe  anxiety and clinical depression). 




Even with my severe social anxiety(lifelong selective mutism, still have trouble simply going outside), I wanted to work a parttime like many kids, so in the past, even if for a few days, I attempted Mcdonalds, a convenience store in the busiest intersection in my college town, and as a last resort overnight shifts at a sorting facility. (Which often makes the news for being brutally physically demanding, even for healthy men in their 20s that they quit after one shift) I worked the most at the sorting facility cuz I didn't have to talk much, though sometimes people yelling at me scared me. I couldn't walk properly for 3 days after one shift. Like I couldn't bend my legs. And now I'm constantly doing online surveys for the tiny amount.



 And last semester I got like 80 USD from school for placing 2nd place in the whole univ for an English competence exam. And with that, even though I have student debts, I wanted to give my family small gifts. Spent a total of about 50USD for both brother's and mother's presents.



Yet both parents are now screaming at me how I didn't earn a fucking cent in my life.



In my time in grad school, I taught undergrad classes, helped someone else's research waking up at 4am and leaving lab at 7pm for a whole month-no weekends, every single day- took care of medical waste (aka frozen headless rat corpses, blood and detached skull with no brain), cleaned *dozens* of rat cages full of rat urine and shit, cleaned the rat room(where lab rats were kept), while lab seniors stole over 2/3 of my lab stipend.


Both my siblings have more than healthy social life. Sister has had over 10 boyfriends, as she is tall and pretty from my parents spending a fortune for her private basketball lesson when she was in middle school, and expensive braces when when was in elementary school. My brother also had braces. Me? I didn't care much about my teeth but mother teased me my teeth looked like a farmer's every. Fucking. Time. She saw me all through my 20s, so I finally broke down and asked for braces since by then I was so self conscious about my teeth and looking like a duck, plus I was having physical difficulties(biting my tongue, mouth, etc). So got mine at 30. And it was way cheaper than both my siblings cuz I didn't need to extract anything. Also while both siblings went to a big dental hospital downtown, I went to a local small dental clinic. My sister got expensive sushi place as a 'reward' each time she went to her dentist as she cried about it hurting. I didn't even think about or want that, I was so grateful for letting me have my braces alone.



So I got upset how she always accused me of 'never earning a cent' so I tried to tell her stop doing that, but she cut me every time until I went into a complete mental breakdown then father gets angry at me for 'yelling' at mother at which point I yelled back with a curse. And now both were not even interested in why I got so upset in the first place.


I took the magnets back, and my imnocent brother's presents, because I 'never earned a fucking cent' and threw them away in the trash can.


And now I want to die. In the heat of the moment, I stabbed myself in the neck with scissors that I was using to wrap the presents (RIP), of course when I was by myself in the bathroom, but it was too dull, unfortunately, and kept slipping.


Now I'm back at my place and want to fucking die. I spent what little I had for their presents, I know I earned less than my sister(who's now a partner in the biggest lawfirm in the fucking world), but I did what I could. I am afraid of even stepping outside, but got drunk on xanax because I truly wanted to earn sonething on my own.


And because I'm currently in school, on partial welfare (because gov thinks my parents are too rich to give me full welfare lmfao), my kind parents help me with rent and food. My bra is ripping apart but I hate my boobs so I didn't spend on a new bra but bought family b day presents.



Now it is all fucked up and I want to fucking hang myself.",1691539820.0,anxiety

I have struggled with depression, anxiety and health anxiety. 

Nothing has ever compared to the intense, overwhelming fear and panic I’ve felt as with health anxiety. I have struggled so bad dealing with this anxiety that for a brief moment for the first time in my life I truly wanted to un-alive myself to make the suffering stop. But I WANT TO LIVE. That is the issue. I want to make it to 30 years old, even 90. 

When I was depressed I was CALM, nothing bothered me. I never felt the need to un-alive myself. I felt the empty void, but it was so much easier to deal with than my anxiety

I’m so emotionally unstable I cry at the smallest things. It pisses me off. 

I’m constantly on edge, panic attack ready in hand at any moment. Im a frequent visitor to 3 hospitals in my area as my anxiety symptoms get so severe I genuinely think I’m dying. I have one thought, im think I’m dying. I have a weird body sensation, I’m dying. I see a cancer commercial - I have it (even spelling the word makes me uneasy). 

I have 2 family doctors (they don’t know about it) - I don’t like the answer from one doctor, I go to the other. One won’t give me an unnecessary medical test, I’ll see the other. 

I go to the hospital and make my symptoms sound so much more severe than necessary hoping they’ll give me an X-ray or mri or something. 

I’m saving money (approx 6 grand) to be able to fly to the states and pay for a full body MRI scan for no reason other than peace of mind, knowing after googling, that it still can’t be 100% accurate and I’ll just hyperfixate on my results. 

I have anxiety about the anxiety medication 

I’ve become obsessed with scanning my food  and beauty products to avoid any carcinogenic ingredients. 

I struggle with emetephobia (fear of vomiting) - I manipulated my doctor into prescribing me a few Ondansetron (zofran) pills - a chemo anti nausea pill - that I carry around with me everywhere I go incase I feel nauseous 
(Before I was blessed with these literal life savers of a pill - I would in one sitting, easily eat 4 tums, 2 gravols, and I kid you not - chug an entire bottle of Pepto bismol - to prevent myself from throwing up - wouldn’t always work)
My emetephobia is so bad my own mother thought I was junky in withdrawal because I was shaking, crying, panicking just because I didn’t want to throw up. 
I try my best to only take my ondansetron as a last case scenario as I truly fear when I run out, I won’t get more. 

I will not eat meat unless it is well done. I will not eat any food that is left on the counter for more than 30 mins (even though there is a 2 hour window). If any meat has a slight discolouration even proven safe to eat, I won’t touch it. 

I can’t stop googling any little thing - which leads to spiraling for days. I will Google for hours even days learning about one or more specific illness. 

My anxiety and panic gets so bad I often throw myself into SVT (hitting 210bpm easily) - then I’m convinced I’m going to drop dead from cardiac arrest. I fear getting a catheter ablation even though it could potentially get rid of my SVT - I’m scared due to the small chance I may be the unlucky 1% who ends up with a pacemaker. 

I often cant sleep, i often think I’m going to die if I go to sleep. I lay in bed shaking, hyperventilating, heart racing and fear never ending. My shortness of breath gets so bad that I bought a pulse oximeter to ensure I’m not dying. But I still think I have lung disease because I can’t fkn breathe. 

I hate being told I’m young and healthy and doctors don’t take me seriously. I’ve already had my appendix taken out and I’m dealing with SVT and anxiety. So clearly I have legitimate health issues. 

My poor bf tries his best to help. Just me being able to tell him what I’m experiencing helps - but it’s just so he can tell the paramedics what my symptoms were should I go unconscious. I ask him once a month how many compressions to breaths there are in CPR (30-2). 

I fixate on a new disease or health problem almost weekly. Then I make a doctors appt to see if whatever symptom I may or may not actually be feeling is a legit concern for whatever disease I believe I have. 

I stress that I’m going to inherit my parents god awful genetics. But the doctors won’t give me an MRI to make sure I don’t have a brain tumour like my mom. They won’t give me a heart echo to make sure I don’t have heart disease like my dad. They won’t do a scope to make sure I don’t have stomach cancer like my step dad who died. 

I take pictures of my literal shit to make sure it’s normal. I want to order a FIT fecal test, but you have to be 45, I was going to order a fake ID and get an online doctor to order one for me. 

I feel the urge to photoshop/illegally edit documents so I can qualify for specific medical tests

I suffer in silence. My family does not know the severity of this. I only mention to my bf when I’m at a point of extreme suffering and I truly believe it’s my end, I only tell him when I think he needs to know just so he can call 911 if needed. 

I refuse to try medication. The only medication I’m on is birth control. I want to get off it because it can increase your risk of ovarian cancer. But I don’t want to be pregnant - due to the emetephobia. 

I’ve tried a therapist - used up all my work benefits already - on the only 3 sessions I had with him. I couldn’t stop crying anytime he asked me a question or got me to do something. I felt he was annoyed with me. I fear ever getting another therapist (like I could afford it…) I fear the same thing that they will be annoyed that I cannot control my emotions and that there really is no helping me

This is never ending. I sometimes have a good period (maybe a couple days or a couple weeks at a time) where I feel okay and suffer minimal or maybe not even at all for a bit. But I find I always at some point go back into the extreme spiraling that lasts for days/weeks until I ultimately crack and send myself to the hospital. Repeat this cycle. 

Never ever would I have imagined that I would deal with anxiety - let alone get to the point it makes me feel like I need to un-alive myself to end the extreme intense suffering it brings me. 

I have never thought in my life I would be dealing with this. Nothing bothered me as a teenager, now I can’t even live. But I WANT TO.

And now, with the effects becoming more and more apparent (look at how hot it is in the southwest!) my mental health too grows worse. On occasion, I’ve voiced my concerns to others, but these people are ones who don’t spend all their time dwelling on these fears. As such, a simple “oh, it’ll be fine,” isn’t very reassuring. Sure, progress has been made. But it’s not enough. The government will continue to allow soulless corporations ransack and pillage the planet of all natural resources, selfish billionaires funding harmful, planet-killing exploits, and capitalism will continue to destroy everything that the common person needs to survive. Greed will kill us all. And it’s obvious the bad future is the one my generation will inherit (I just turned 18). Others may say that abstaining from the news will help, but even then it won’t provide a complete escape. How can I blame the consistent above-freezing temperatures in the winter and sweltering summers on some anomaly? 
And let’s not forget how climate change deniers are still allowed to express their harmful opinions and influence the impressionable public. Politicians will continue their empty promises, on the right and left, until there is quite literally no more clean air for them to breathe, and are forced to drink the same dirty, rationed water as the rest of us. 
And it will only get worse. The trees will wilt in the summer. The forests will grow silent. The food on our plates will diminish in amount and variety. Gone are the days I will be able to enjoy anything that’s not made of crushed up bugs and soy. 
And my generation is still quite powerless. I can’t do anything. Myself and everyone my age can only sit on our phones or stage an unsuccessful protest. Leaders have never listened to brightly colored signs carried by teenagers, and it seems they never will.
It’s also the little things that trigger this feeling. I have a few good examples of this. When I was a kid, no less than 5 years ago, one of my favorite hobbies was to go looking for salamanders. I’d do it for hours, and I’d find loads of them. Nowadays, it’s much harder. I went looking for a solid 30 minutes one time, and only found two. 
As little as 2 years ago I would be greeted by the sounds of crickets and the beautiful flicker of fireflies. Now the night is dead and quiet, and I am afraid this will spell doom for the birds. Wildlife means a lot to me. 
Butter, tomatoes, and certain products are becoming more and more expensive. This is directly the result of climate change induced events. This could play into an Oryx and Crake like scenario, where I am forced to eat mushy paste with an unidentifiable taste, sipping dirty water. 
Snow in my state (Connecticut) is a rarity. While CT is known for its aptly-named “bipolar” weather, the winters are consistently mild and warm. This January, there was a 2-week stretch of days where it was 40F or above. My friends like the warm weather, but it gets me all kinds of fucked up.
My parents and friends are unaffected and don’t seem to understand. No, my parents aren’t climate change deniers, nor are they rightists. But they DID live for 45 or so years where the earth wasn’t fucked, and had no reason to worry otherwise. The birds tweeted and the food was cheap. Blissful ignorance. At that point, climate change was a far-off concern. I’ve told them about my worries about it (not the suicidal part, I’m NOT going back to a treatment center) but they don’t fully grasp it. No I’ll will toward them, but damn it makes me feel isolated. I don’t tell my friends for fear of being ostracized because of said anxiety. When I go to chat rooms or read articles about this stuff, it’s all the same people with the same feelings. The news fucking kills me. 
While defeatism is harmful, it seems like it’s the only viable option. Why be optimistic about our future? It’d be like hoping a rotting pumpkin could suddenly regenerate, and become a fresh new plant. Or something like that. My point is THERE IS NOTHING TO BE HOPEFUL FOR. 
I’m close to getting into college, and starting a new chapter of my life. But what good is getting a degree for a job that will have no demand in a now-scarred and broken society? 
For a while I have been toying with the idea of taking my life, for a variety of reasons. There was one time when I made a vow that I would do so. It was in January of 2022, on an abnormally warm night. I knew that I didn’t want to live in a bleak, desolate future, one fractured by climate change. I said I’d kill myself 10 years from that date if nothing was done to fix it. 
Then I thought about cutting it down to 5. 
Now, I’m thinking sooner. Hell, part of me wants to just get it over with now. I don’t care if there’s nothing after death. I’d be at peace. And my miserable life would end. If anything, I’d be doing myself an act of mercy.
These thoughts come through my head daily. They grow louder, and louder. I’ve even considered to start drafting my will. One of the only things keeping me on this earth is the fear of hurting my family. But this too won’t stop me for much longer. It’s not the ideal solution, but the most sensible one for me.

I don’t know what I’m seeking by writing this. Maybe it’ll go mostly unnoticed. At this point I can’t think of any tangible, meaningful reasons not to end it. Most of the things that people say you should live for are tied back to the earth and nature, and if those are gone, what’s the point? Apart from a few positive, very small and localized stories, there is nothing but doom and gloom in the way of climate news. Heat Wave this. Record breaking temperatures that. Food shortages. Refugee crisis. Want to know why you can’t afford that steak? CLIMATE CHANGE. Know why half of the world will be uninhabitable? CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

tl;dr anxiety and grief about the climate and bleak future are making me want to take my own life. I feel hopeless and can’t think of any good reasons why I shouldn’t kill myself.",1689458435.0,anxiety

As the title  says is enough

I’m a very ugly male 

Im 6ft tall, lanky long legs short torso, black hair high receding hairline and bad yelowy skin

10 years ago I worked in a pub. I loved the job but there was a problem, my looks. You wouldn’t believe how evil and sly women can be 

In short I was the only gly guy there, the women managers would pin things on me that were other guys fault but they are not blame them. They’re hot shit can’t have them thinking less of her through snitching.


The favoutism got so bad I was forced out because they wanted ‘a hot n nice one in’ instead so they mixed up my shift and I ‘didn’t turn up’ acc to them so they fired me.

Was even forced to pay my last 4 weeks wages back idk why 


So yea thanks my looks for ruining a job I loved 


tho that was 2015 it still hurts the same

Girls calling me a ‘Ming’ for messing up their ticket entrance when it was the computer 


One night I was called things and it by guys I worked with 


▪️Once I worked outside with another guy and 1 more was inside. I turned my back then back forward to see one whispering to the other ‘swap with him please I’m not standing with that’ then they ordered me to go back inside 


Since then I don’t leave the house, I drink 2 litres of scotch a week and watch my favourite tv shows every night at least, I smoke a lot of weed.

My youth was wasted on video games instead of skill development, social skill building and relationships. Had a total of one girlfriend in my life in college. 

Truthfully, can anyone give me a single reason of why I should continue living? Anxiety stops me from doing anything at best. At worst, it eats me from inside out, and I flood tears until it stops. Entire days go by without me doing anything by daydream about misery and inevitably set off a panic attack.

Feeding the anxiety will make it worse for you overall, but its almost like my brain WANTS me to gravitate that way. Plus, those who suffer from insecurities and shit will almost always never get over being anxious. it will always come back. There's no curing it, once its part of you, it's natural. It hits at random moments, too, the big anxiety attacks. I'll be a great conversationalist one second, and a boor the other.  One second I could love a friend, the next I could ruin his day by being an angsty fuck.

I also kind of feel like it makes me a worse person. The worse the anxiety, the bigger of a complete, unlikable asshole I am. I axed the relationship with my best friend because he made a small criticism and I saw it when I was feeling shit. I took it out on him pretty bad, saying some awful shit, and blocked him when all he could say upon seeing the wall of abuse was, ""dude, why?"" I felt the worst I'd ever felt the next day, and had a gigantic breakdown. I hate myself.

Her ex boyfriend was controlling, she couldn't see her family ever and i think she's been feeling guilty over it and hid her relationship for the most part. 

On my side, I've been in a relationship with a lot of trust issues, she had cheated on me like 4 days into our relationship and it had been pretty hard to gain trust from there on out really. I have pretty bad self esteem myself and mostly i really fear abandonment (ADHD comorbidity most likely) 

We knew each other for years and had dated for a bit but we're both quite introverted and we mostly had communication issues and different lifestyles at that point. I must also point out that i tried to hit her up a few times during those years and i found myself thinking about her and catching up on the social's from time to time ... kinda feeling like we had ""unfinished business"".

It so happens that now (7 years later) she was working with a friend of mine which i had no idea until i noticed her name on her work outlook page and asked her about it. 

We ended talking to each other a bit on messenger and like, we really hit it off naturally, it's like we'd never stopped talking to each other. I was a bit hesitant at first coming from hard times with my ex gf at that point and clearly having trust issues but we ended up seeing each other. Again it was ""love at first sight"" no but really ... It's like we we're just bonded by this invisible force. We talked and talked for hours drove around and it felt really easy to open up about what was happening in my heart and in my head. We then had this night were i proposed to install foot LED's in her car (Old inside cause she had some in her car years ago and i used to give her a (jokingly) hard time for it). It just felt like we were kids hanging together, i had this deep sense in me that i was myself with her, it felt like my chest was opening up for the first time with someone in years, if not ever. 

After that we started hanging around and just listening to music and like quickly we went the next step. We kissed on a Two Feet song in the middle of installing LED's in a Canadian Tire parking lot, but it felt like the best kiss ever, can't put words it just felt like our veins we're connecting together and we we're sharing more than just our lips on each others. 

From then on it was just love for days, i felt really good loving her and we really had this deep sense of easiness, something i never really had before in a relationship it felt easy, but deep and sincere at the same time. 

Months go by and i still feel the same way really, we end up with a temporary apartment that we spend weekends in together watching movies (also smoking weed but.....) 

The sex is also amazing, intense, purposeful, love fueled, we've really been able to explore and open, it was up she's the most beautiful girl and like i felt the same way back then when i didn't know her so, unbiased here.

Having that much .............. Unprotected sex. Ended up like you would expect .. We we're both like noticing changes ... boo... MOOD changes ... so we kinda knew deep down it was going on but one morning she took the test and ... positive ...  To be honest it felt scary and sad but also good, i felt like she was the right person and my mind and my heart were low key contemplating the idea of building a family with her. But in practice, the timing was bad. Our relationship was young and we're still pretty young and she was at the start of her career job so we both agreed to go the abortion route even tho i felt we both had feeling about that but in the end it felt like the right thing to do. 

The day came and ... honestly it felt weird but fine, we went home and really never talked about it again that much. 

2 weeks later, i get in a bad car crash, my car (which i loved really I'm a big car guy and i spent hours working on it) 

From then on, my mind honestly starts falling apart ... I'm grieving the loss of ... a child i guess ? And now I'm grieving for my car too. Even tho i try keeping myself above water it just feels like I'm going down this hole and giving my everything, accident PTSD, work schedule stress with bosses that don't understand what I'm going trough ... About a month later i lose my job. At this point we're moving in together in our like permanent place 2 days from then and stress just keeps piling up, i try to keep it above my head but like, my good old friend anxiety is climbing up the ladder fast to bring me down. 

Our relationship is holding strong nonetheless really, we're talking a lot about how we like some things and some others less as far as living together goes and we find solutions to make it better for the two of us ... All this time from now on it really feels like we're an incredible team from every angle.

Although ... I'm still falling apart inside and the more it goes the less adequate i feel to her and it just seems like I'm worthless, unemployed, at home, doing not much to find a job cause i can't help myself thinking I'm not worth it. To be clear, i still try to do my best to her and take as much as i can so she can feel good too. (Chores, waking up with her in the morning even though i could be sleeping, prepping coffee in the morning that kinda stuff...). I try to keep up with everything that makes me more anxious too like, calling for jobs etc. But it's like rollercosters really.

Time goes by a bit and we had vacation planned with her family, anxiety is coming up, it's a 8 hours drive, we had a bit of an argument few days prior and haven't really talked since. So the day comes up and, i feel incapable of going, agoraphobia i think it is in the end but like, I'm overwhelmed in anxiety from everywhere. On one side i really don't want to deceive her family because we're close and i like them a lot really. But i just can't, i freeze, i let myself fall into anxiety and i let it control what i want at this point. At first she's real mad but then we talk and she's you know ... ""Fine"" about it. 

2 days go by with her not around and, at this point it's bad, I'm making plans about killing myself and i can't bare to think about myself for more than two seconds so ... I tell myself, GO YOU DUMBASS GET OVER THAT ANXIETY. 

So i tell her I'm gonna come over and do it, i kinda feel odd still, going long distances is really an anxiety trigger for me. Especially alone. 

So i still make it 3 hours into the drive and like, I'm really anxious at that point, my smartwatch is telling me i have 90 something % stress and i this point I'm sweating i feel nauseous and like i feel it's going down so i text her like, i might stop for the night 3 hours away from were you're staying and she answered my something like ""Well, Maybe you should turn around if you can't do it"" but to me, at that point, it felt like ... Satire?  So like now i feel rejected and the gates of my heart have closed ... I'm turning around for sure. It feels wrong but i just can't help it. She calls me a few times but i really don't wanna talk cause really i just wanna die at this point. She then sends me two voice messages we're she's shouting at me and like, it's this anger i never felt before. Like i had chills listening to them and i couldn't like stop hearing it in my head. It felt like i was thrown back into my old relationship and everything was crashing against me. 

I get back home in the end and she's really pissed and sad, really not talking much that night and i feel like she want's us to be over. At that point i find myself having disappointing a whole lot of persons i really love and it's turbocharged my anxiety to the top and my self esteem is at peek low. 

So, here we are, that night ... 

I'm in IT, i don't know her password but i kinda know what people use as passwords usually so ... I open up her computer, check the hint ... Was pretty obvious so ... After a few tries, it goes trough. 

I'm feeling it reach inside my chest that rush of self sabotage that is happening, my mind telling me ""go look at everything and prove yourself that you're a worthless pos"" 

At this point i open up messenger and the only think i think about is her ex, her abusive ex ... And i can't get the tough out of my mind that he's better than me to her or was you know ... She's been with her 4 years and on my side ... I'm worthless soooo. Better check out how it was... 

As it so happens, it's like had told me before, i found out he was a way fatter piece of shit than i am so, i feel stupid as fuck and it seems like I'm snapped back to reality as fast as Eminem in 8 miles. Now i feel confident in our relationship cause, I've seen he was bad to her and that she wasn't how she is with me.

But now ... I've snooped and i feel bad for it, I've broken her trust like her ex did and i kinda know it's not gonna end well if i tell her but, she's still 8 hours away and i still have agoraphobia but ... She's still there for 4 days, F THIS I'm going. 

So i go, really like, can't believe it myself to have made it so far alone, without dying of anxiety. 

At first she's like a bit mad still and emotional about me turning around but. We end up having an awesome time there, it felt refreshing and i felt good with myself for being there... Deep inside tough, there's that snooping thing poking me in the heart from time to time but i really don't want to mess up her vacation more than i already did so i wash it off for now. 

I really don't think about it for a few days after we're back home. 

So at that point, vacation is over ... But I'm still unemployed so i stay home. 

Dear anxiety is back, i go into our office room and i see her computer laying there, and i can feel it come to me like ... What if i missed something and in the end he was actually better than you ... ? 

So i type her password, open up her browser .... stop. 

I went to the bathroom and i looked at myself in the mirror in disgust, how can i do that, why did i do that. We built that relationship on trust and solid bases and I've felt satisfied in every way with her. 

Just not with myself.

I got to my computer, confessed to what i had done on a notepad++ file and leave it open for a while, trying to think about the ways everything is gonna go down and try to have a last moment in what used to be a healthy relationship. I take i deep breath and i send it to her ... 

\*Silence\*

She comes home from work, tells me we're done and locks herself in out bedroom.

I feel atrocious, anxious, overwhelmed. I can't believe it, I made her that sad by going into past traumas and violating her privacy for no other reason than my own feeling of worthlessness,

I try to talk to her but at this point she's really closed and my fear of abandonment kicks real hard. I did that to the person i cherished the most. I really just wanted to impact only myself in this and not her ... 

Now i have bad separation anxiety it feels like i can't let go and she really doesn't want us to be together anymore ever and we're moving out once we find new places. 

But my heart is still there, in that healthy relationship where i feel like we had everything but now things have changed just, so fast, so abruptly ... I just can't let go and it's making it harder on her too so... 

Long story guys sorry but, 

(TLDR:)

I just wanted to know if some of you we're ever in a healthy relationship that you sabotaged in a similar way in a single isolated event when everything else about that relationship was fine ... 

If anyone did, how did it turn out ? 

If bad, how can i make it better ? 

How did you guys got trough snooping yourself or how did you feel getting snooped on?

And how can i let go on someone i really think is the love of my life ....",1661561044.0,anxiety

Unfortunately I found myself in one of those bad situations this year. I try to keep a positive, “you can do it” mindset but lately i feel horrible frequently. When I was a 6 y/o child, my parents had a nasty alcoholic divorce and my sister and I quickly moved into a more affordable house with my mom. For the next 15 years my Dad would relapse every few years, detox, rehab, and also got remarried 4 times. He was not really there for me and did not teach me much but he was wealthy and occasionally bought me things out of guilt. I lived with my stepdad and mother and my stepdad was abusive and kind of creepy. His own biological children hated him and he would try to do this weird “tough on me” father son bullshit with me as a substitute for not being able to parent his own children. Him and my mom screamed at each other every single day. My mom wished him dead for life insurance money after he survived a car wreck injury free. He would often be weird sexually with my mom making comments and also made very creepy comments to my sister’s girl friends, even offering alcohol to them while they were not 21. and it’s one thing to show mutual affection to your wife but she was disgusted by it. She always said she only stayed for money. He was racist using the hard R frequently and he made my first girlfriend uncomfortable with sexual innuendos. I feel bad for even bringing her around in my teen years but she was my favorite person back then so I loved having her over if it meant avoiding my mom/stepdad at all costs and going straight to my room. Every social or extracurricular situation i tried to engage in during high school was negatively affected by my mom. In sports she would cause drama with the other moms of my peers and tried to get wayyy overly involved in my personal life with peers to the point my friends would get annoyed. I tried community college but i quickly realized i had to get out of that town so i moved to colorado. During my teen years i also developed an on-and-off alcohol/drug habit/addiction to cope and after moving to colorado i got sober. Before i moved to colorado my stepdad told me my mom’s health issues were my fault for financial reasons and that i was killing her. I have been sober almost a year now. But when i lived in colorado my parents would constantly contact me telling me i need to be on medication but I hated every antidepressant i ever tried and i thought i found true permanent serenity out there. I blocked my parents so they started contacting my AA 12 step friends/sponsor on facebook trying to get thru to me. Complete invasion of my life. I blew up on them for this told them i hated them and to leave me the fuck alone. On top of this my roommate got evicted for stealing and breaking things so now I was sober but could not afford rent. I gave up on colorado and moved to the beach. I love being away from my hometown but I’m broke and staying in a homeless shelter. You would not guess it by my sloppy typing on my lunch break but I’m a pretty smart guy. I love to read and write and make music. I am very flawed and hurt though. I walk 3 miles to work and back every day rain or shine. I see no fulfillment in slowly paying off debt in a 9-5 for 10 years just to maybe live a decent life one day. I would love to be self-employed as an artist. I send hate mail to my parents sometimes. It feels like coping or “getting the last word.” I need help but cannot afford it medically. I guess some words of encouragement would help. I hate how my parents get off looking like the good guys. They were so hateful and mean my entire life.

113,1374.0,Feeling like I can’t survive OCD (and constant relentless trauma for nearly 3 decades),3,174mxn6,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/174mxn6/feeling_like_i_cant_survive_ocd_and_constant/,1,"To summarize, I’ve faced childhood abuse and neglect while getting bullied in multiple schools during my teens. They happened for different reasons so each event had no connection and was more of just unlucky. The relationships I was in were also with someone emotionally abusive/belittling or violent. My most recent therapist diagnosed me with CPTSD. I’ve spent my whole life rebuilding after each traumatic event or trying to build while facing trauma. Despite depression and anxiety I was determined to survive and stay on track in life. I had a few close friends who were frequently gaslighting or using me as I came to find. Most of the time during traumatic events, I had noone for support and was completely isolated, had noone to talk to in person or online for months/years.

7 years ago, there was a particular incident where my father threatened to kill me (not unusual) and called the cops to knock down my door (as I was protecting myself in my room). At the same time I’ve been trying to leave my first abusive relationship. After that incident I developed contamination OCD. Can’t touch things other people have touched etc to protect myself from people. I have been struggling with taking care of basic needs and making a living consistently.

Fast forward to this year, I finally managed to leave another abusive relationship and I’m living on my own. Hoping to have a safe space to heal and rebuild. With the help of a counsellor I was learning self-care and better coping techniques. Felt happier and less afraid, felt like I could confront OCD too because I was safe in my beautiful home. That same week, a pest infestation (roaches that entered from bathroom drains) started at home. People who know me would know this is the worst possible thing that could happen for me. I’ve set up a lot of preventive measures for this happening but somehow it still did. For the past 5 months, I’ve been using all sorts of practical solutions and mental coping techniques to survive this. The first few months I thought I had to kill myself as everything I kept safe was in danger. It also took whatever normal life I just started to get back away from me, since I had to clean all the time and stay up till dawn to keep watch. I’ve even spent a month staying elsewhere. I don’t have any friends or family in the country, so I have no support and I struggle to take care of basic needs with the additional burden.

I’ve since returned home for 5 weeks but the pest problem isn’t over and I’m feeling like giving up on life again. The way it has happened also seems to feed my worst fears or it can read my mind. For example, I would keep watch every night in my bedroom and I wouldn’t see any for days. The moment that I stop feeling afraid or forget to check, within a few minutes one would appear in front of my eyes. Sometimes I can’t even physically see where it came from. Like I walked past 5 seconds ago and there was nothing. This type of coincidence happened at least 50 times in the past months. This feeds into my lifelong sense of helplessness or feeling cursed, like something is just out to kill me and won’t let me live.

It happened again today. My bedroom has been safe for weeks. I had cleaned it a final time and consoled myself that at least my bedroom is safe. Last night I convinced myself to sleep 2 hours before dawn for the first time. I have been confined indoors for a week due to exhaustion and probably feeling depressed. I also have no purpose outside. Was determined to go out today, got all dressed and then I found one in my bedroom in the day. Once again I had to cancel my plans to go out in order to clean up.

Over the months, I have accepted as much as I could about the situation and the distress has reduced slightly, say if I found it in my living room or areas I could clean more easily. I started seeing an OCD specialist last month, not much progress yet but felt braver. Even a few days ago, I decided to be brave enough to have food at home at night as I haven’t seen any in more than a week (I usually had to eat before dark or as fast as possible). Sure enough just when I was convinced I have killed them all, one appeared right next to me and I didn’t notice.

I feel like I am not allowed to let my guard down, just like during the other times when I was in an abusive situation. I tried to do all I can to unlearn it, but I don’t even have the chance or a break from stress for a month since I could remember. I always regret not dying sooner. I keep surviving and there is no respite and I am suffering all alone. I don’t even know how I did it for 3 decades.

114,1392.0,I screamed so loud from trauma the police came to my house,1,13rksh7,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/13rksh7/i_screamed_so_loud_from_trauma_the_police_came_to/,0,"I just need some support or someone to encourage me cause i feel rock bottom right now. Everything seemed to be going wrong my whole life, and everytime i try to move forward something bad always stops me. I feel broken and damaged, like im not human. 

For a bit of background i have severe PTSD  
mainly from my abusive mother as well as some stepfathers,and ex partner  
(including his family).  
I have recently started a new job about a week  
ago, everything seemed to be going well. However within a couple days of  
starting i started to get sick (fever, flu like symptoms despite noone else in  
my house being sick, extremely high heartrate and pots symptoms, i also got  
about 3 different infections within a space of one week). I believe that this  
might be caused by some autoimmune disorder potentially lupus and im having  
bloodtests done next week (probably due to long term toxic stress and abuse),  
as ive been suffering long term from symptoms such as severe fatigue, joint  
pain, headaches, dizziness, low grade fevers without a cause, and tachycardia  
(usually my heartrate is 73 but when these 'episodes' happen it goes to 100 and  
130+ when i stand up). So anyway i did not want to call in sick because i did  
not want to dissapoint my boss and i dragged myself to work once again. I  
started to feel very unwell and while i was walking to work my heartrate jumped  
up to 185 and i half collapsed outside my work (my boss had to take me to  
hospital). This was a couple days ago and since then ive gotten antibiotics for  
one of my multiple infections (UTI) yet i still feel incredibly weak and sick  
and all my joints hurt.  
Now, to make things worse this was stressful  
enough for me with all the fever, infection, sleep deprivation and stress from  
health uncertainty that already made me break down and cry. But to top things  
off, yesterday i was sitting in a cafe waiting for my husband to finish  
shopping and i received a phone call. i initally thought it was the hospital so  
i picked up, however the person on the end of the line was from the employment  
company that i just started working for. They told me that my employment  
criminal background check was taking longer than usual and that it 'might' mean  
theres a problem (although it could also be due to having moved around a  
lot).They started to interrogate me like some criminal and ask if ive had  
arrests, cautions etc which i havent. Now usually i would have managed to keep  
rational since ive never been in trouble with the law and said oh i dont have  
any criminal records, however i became overly anxious (bad mix of tiredness,  
sickness, period and stress) so i told them about my very abusive ex boyfriend  
who tried to claim i raped him, tortured him and starved him (despite me being  
19 at the time and him being twice my size and in his 20's), i said that  
perhaps he could have mentioned my name to the police because he's threatened  
to do this before to 'get back at me for ruining his life'. I also mentioned  
that the police was called before but it wasnt to do with me being a criminal  
but rather the victim, because i was being kicked out the house and he was  
being violent throwing my clothes out the wardrobe, chucking objects across the  
room etc. (in hindsight i realise i should not have even mentioned that to the  
women but i was mentally impaired due to infection, fever, meds, lack of sleep  
etc and just blabbed like a fool). Since i mentioned that i never had any  
police involvement myself as a perpetrator i stupidly assumed the woman would  
just say 'oh ok seems youre not a criminal, it might be something unrelated  
thats taking longer' but NO. The woman just couldnt let it slide, she asked me  
to give her detailed descriptions of what happened with my abusive ex, and she  
even asked me to find any court/police documents i have of this and share it  
with them. She even told me she would be sharing this with the family im  
working for. At this point i was already extremely triggered, the thought of  
not only having to look at, and talk about my past trauma but also to share it  
to be passed around seemed unbearable to me (some of the information also  
mentions my parents abusing me and demonising me for having been abused as a  
child). I told her I will not share this and i dont want to talk about it  
anymore because its incredibly traumatic and i have already told her everything  
I possibly could. But this woman just would NOT LET IT GO, its almost as if my  
story was some novel that she just could not stop mid-way. She told me she will  
STILL call me to find out more 'for the safety of my workplace' (essentially  
accusing me of actually being some rapist or dangerous person myself despite  
already saying theres nothing on my actual criminal record and that the guy was  
already called out for bluffing and being manipulative).  
Side point: (the abuse was not just from this  
man but also from his family who also emotionally abused me most of the events  
mentioned in this paragraph are from when i was 19,) his mum pulled me out the  
car by my hair before, and they refused to get me help when i was severely sick  
which resulted in me almost dying, they also treated me like some monster  
because according to their words i was the child of 'a wh\*re and a criminal  
man' so they treated me like the trash they thought i was, they were also of a  
south asian background and were constantly racist to me about white saying that  
we are all 'wh\*res. They also spread lies about me to mutual friends and the  
community that made the whole church community shun me (i was a part of  
extremist christianity due to my ex being one.) My ex, my family and the  
community made me feel like i was not human but some 'demon' like something was  
wrong with me. I even got kicked out of the church, because of the rumours  
being spread about me being a lesbian and prostitute ( i cut my hair short due  
to a mental breakdown, and they managed to found some bikini picture of me my  
mother took on a beach when i was 11 and used it to attack my character and say  
i was a prostitute. The mother of my ex i suspect sent herself fake hateful  
text messages with crude hateful content in order to convince her son and the  
church that it was me.  
They all kicked me out and kicked me down when  
i was already at absolute rock bottom, i was 19, extremely traumatised and  
emotionally vulnerable and homeless (due to my also abusive mother kicking me  
out the house at 18 so she can bring back her violent alcoholic husband who  
hated me and would force me to get in the car with him just so he could ride me  
around with music blasting on full to induce panic attacks in me and who spit  
in my face, tried to explode the house, and tried to claim i tried to stab him  
when i was 15 when i was trying to slit my throat due to his and my mothers  
emotional abuse) My mother to summarise was either a psychopath or 'that other  
disorder', she had no empathy she had no interest in my wellbeing and would  
abuse me emotionally, neglect me, allow her boyfriends to abuse me and laugh  
when they did, and even beat me due to small things such as me cutting my hair  
or plucking my eyebrows (she could not have given two dumps about my health,  
mental health or even if i died she only cared that i looked presentable as if  
i was just a trophy of hers. I was not a human with needs or emotions to her,  
the day she kicked me out she called me every name under the sun and screamed  
at me to get the hell out and that she disowns me because i dared to confront  
her abuse and neglect). There is also a possibility that she almost killed me  
when i was a toddler because i had a misterious accident where i fell down,  
broke a mug and slashed my wrist on it and almost bled to death while she  
conveniantly left me alone and was cleaning in another room, so that was almost  
fatal neglect of her at best. So yeah, i kind of had nowhere to go, and was  
stuck with this ex and family for a year, a year within which i was barely  
allowed to go out as the mother was incredibly controlling and manipulative, a  
year during which my ex threatened to kill me by driving the car at full speed  
twice threatening he will crash the car until i was crying and thinking im  
gonna die.  
So yeah after all of this (and much more) I  
kind did not want to be FORCED by the woman in the company to share these  
details and i definitely did not want written information about this being  
passed around the company and my workplace for everyone to spectate at like im  
some zoo animal. But the woman was unrelenting and kept pressuring me to give  
up more details (when tbh ive already told her everything) and pressuring me to  
share documents etc. I was also extra triggered by the fact that once again i  
was the one being demonised and treated as if im some dangerous or evil  
individual when i was the victim and was broken inside out. So after the  
phonecall i once again texted the woman to say i will not be sharing any more  
information and than i have PTSD and its retraumatising me. She once again told  
me I HAVE to share all the details whether its traumatic or not and said she  
wants to call me 9:30am the next day (as in today) for a more 'indepth chat'. I  
initially agreed over text as i felt pressured, however the whole night i could  
not stop thinking about it and i was feeling extremelly triggered and  
distressed and could not sleep. So in the evening i messaged her to say that i  
was starting to have PTSD episode and that my mental health was in extreme  
danger and that i am no longer willing to have the chat. I woke up this morning  
with a text from her saying once again that i HAVE to talk about it whether its  
triggering my PTSD or not and that i was posing a danger to the vulnerable  
people in the workplace DESPITE me ALREADY telling her i have no criminal charges  
or records and that i already shared everything i could. She then attempted to  
call me despite me telling her not to and ignored the phone call. At this point  
my PTSD was already about 99/100 and i texted her saying that she has to stop  
this otherwise i might end up commiting suicide and then the company will have  
a newspaper article written about them forcing a vulnerable young person with  
PTSD into killing themselves. At this point my PTSD reached 100. I started to  
hit my head with my hand non stop and it felt i could not control my right  
hand, my husband tried to stop me by holding my hands however i started to  
scream. And by scream i mean absolutely blood curdling painful primal yelling.  
This happened for about 5-10 minutes but i lost track of time so it could have  
been shorter or longer. My husband then asked me if he could help and he called  
the company on the phone and told them that if they want to know anything they  
can ask him because hes aware of everything and that her collegue has triggered  
me into a full blown mental breakdown despite me warning her multiple times. At  
this point the police knocked on our door to do a welfare check, as my screams  
were so terrifying that the next door neighbour called the police thinking  
someone was being murdered. They even suspected that my current husband was  
abusing me, but i quickly explained the situation to them about my ex bf and  
the woman who kept triggering me.  
Thats pretty much it for now, i will add more  
details if i forgot anything. But yeah im kind of in shock right now. Ive  
spoken to a couple mental health crisis helplines but i still feel crap. I  
guess i just needed to vent and know im not crazy, or if anyone has gone  
through anything similar. I sometimes feel so alone in this and even though i have  
a husband to support me im scared to over burden him and i guess i just needed  
to get this all off my chest.

I've been physically and mentally and verbally abused since childhood and still going on. 

My parents are the emotional manipulative narcissistics. My childhood was so sad.. I was a pure innocent shy kid who was very kind and that kindness always taken as granted because I was so stupid back then to understand. My Dad was working abroad and comes to visit every twice a year while me and sister lived with Mom, She is the embodiment of negativity, she loves to discourage people and never be satisfied, she physically and verbally abused me to 17 years and she kinda stopped physical abuse when I try to suicide but she is still manipulative and verbal abusive. My Dad is almost the same and my sister is just heartless.

 I been a bully victim for 16 years in my school to high school and it mentally broke me when I finally turned 15-16 because my teen life was the roughest. I wasn't mentally weak though, I always fight back bullies but it too much back then, it was me vs group and they made my school life hell and I couldn't do anything to my parents but due to rough childhood in home combined with school feeling like torture jail just mentally broke me and gave me depression and severe anxiety. no one helped me even my parents. all my friends just used me and cut me out of their life once I was no longer useful to them.

It angers me so much because I never done anything wrong to anyone.. I always been kind and people hated me and made me feel like a burden especially bullies and my parents... they being a good parents to my sister while be the opposite to me.

I am now 20 but this pain poisoning me, I am so corrupted right now, I am no longer the nice and kind I used to be, I get so angry and hold grudge at people who mistreat me and think of every evil things happening to them.l because I am so done with being treated like this. I can't let go or move on because of the pain and trauma. I am so burnt out in life and hopeless, I don't feel excited, happy or motivated to do anything now... I can't even remember when I genuinely laughed with happiness :/

All the people who ruined my LIFE living their best life right now while now I have depression, anxiety, ADHD and even physical trauma and my life didn't turn out to be better instead it gets worse year by year.. it feels like am cursed.

I am a 31 year old female. I have recently been diagnosed with anxiety and I think that I am experiencing depression as well. As a child, I was constantly  raped by a teenager in my neighborhood. I told my brother and he and his friends beat the guy up but then shortly after, my brother would spend years forcing himself onto me via vaginal and anal. I was the 5th of 9 children, my mom worked 3 jobs so she was never aware of what was going on and my dad was always out and never emotionally available. At 18, me and my now husband began dating and I told him what happened and I thought that I was ok. Well, fast forward to May of last year, I was at my nieces wedding reception, she rented a villa, and I felt like being that I was with family, I was ok.... I wasn't, I let go and got extremely drunk while a group of people sat and talked to where I ended up having sex with someone. I only remembered bits and pieces, initially. I DID remember that I told him no and that I was married but we still had sex. He woke me up before he left my room and I remembered crying and telling him that I was married and him saying that he was sorry. The next day I woke up embarrassed and filled with guilt. As I left, he called me and told me that he had asked for my phone number that night and I had given it to him. He told me that we had sex twice and that I when he asked me if I wanted him to stop I said yes :'(    He told me what happened and as he did, the memories began to come flooding in. I was so ashamed  and emotional because I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. 

I spoke to him a few more times and realized that although he had been drinking, he was coherent, drinks on the regular, and has a high tolerance. I asked him about his status and he told me that he was negative and that he could send his results to me and when I asked him about why he chose me, he said ""because you were married so I knew you were safe."" I became conflicted because as time went on and I filled in the puzzle piece memories, I realized that it felt good. I became suicidal, I wanted to kill him for doing this to me. I have always been honest with my husband about things but I couldn't about this. I couldn't hurt him. I had planned on committing suicide one day that my husband and kids were away. I opened up and told my friend about what happened and she picked up on me wanting to commit suicide and kill him. She begged me not to and to go get tested which I did. There I broke down to a nurse and told her what happened and she helped me as well and suggested therapy. I started going and trying to figure it out. The therapist said that I need to forgive myself and put me on prozac  but I stopped taking it because of how it made me feel.

2months later (July 2019), the male contacted me again from another number, different from the one that I had blocked, and said that ""he missed me."" I told him that he didn't know me and he said that he knew and that he wanted to. I told him that he knew that I was drunk and to leave me alone. He asked if we could be friends and when I repeated no!, it seemed as though I hurt his feeling and he hung up. Since then on, I have been battling with crying spells, and anxiety.  In March of this year, I created an instragram page and he messaged me asking if it was me, I turned around and immediately deleted the page. It seems to have reopened my old childhood wounds because now, I have found that I am putting myself in compromising situations with individuals. My Dr. had put me on Lexapro and I sometimes feel okay but other times I just want it to stop. All of my worrying, all of my fears, tears, loneliness and panic attacks. I have started to envision myself dead but I don't feel suicidal. I just want to fix me. I want to tell my husband what is wrong with me but I cant. I feel like there is no way out of these thoughts and fears. I want them to stop!! I am afraid to commit suicide because I know that my kids need me but I feel so alone and sad.

Grew up in a religious family where homosexuality is a gross sin and my parents were divorced and too busy. I grew up with one teaching strict morals and the other letting me watch R rated movies and tv shows often depicting rape, murder, brutality, racism, ableism so on so on at a young age not realizing it was further traumatizing me. In school I was bullied for having traits of being weird and not having proper communication skills for my age demographic. Even so I made friends but my mother knowing I was lonely allowed me to but eventually stopped me from seeing friends because they were a 'bad' influence. Being sexually abused around the age of 4 I was aware of my private parts and sunk into masturbating and later in my preteens into porn addiction. I hadn't realized how my life was being set up and I didn't reach out to anything thinking I would somehow grow in my religion and live life like that. In my teens I became suicidal and resorted to various ways of selfharm and running away to Toronto once. After being hospitalized for three days and being prescribed heavy drugs that were wrongly prescribed and even apologized for by the nurse there, I went to therapy. I think therapy does wonders for people but I never got my drivers licence and had to get rides from my mom and those rides became too stressful and we'd often be late to the appointments. I really am interested in psychology and I understand we need a purpose but I learned about determinism and it only makes sense that everything is predetermined which might be absolute truth or maybe just a victim mindset. 
Regardless I tried to overdose on pills the other night but they weren't strong enough and cut myself up again.
I've never been so calm and ready to end the story.
I haven't anyone to talk about what's happening but it seems like a repeat of everything.
I've lost my faith, friends, love and support.

 my mom is abusive physically emotially and verbally. shes also a narcissist and i dont know why she treats me and my siblings the way she does. everyday i wish that i had loving parents that actually cared about me. and if ur wondering where my dad is at then u have the same question as me. im never allowed to see him because my mom doesnt let me but hes a severe alchoholic and addict (hard drugs like heroin.) anyways back to my mom. all she does is be abusive towards me and my siblings but ESPECIALLY ME for NO REASON absolutely NONE. for example im a girl. all i did was straighten my hair without asking her and she punched me in my face like 5 times ripped out my hair and dragged me out of my bed by my arm (i have a bunk bed.) after she got done hitting me for what seemed like forever she cut my hair all the way to my shoulders. just for straightening it. not only that but she lost a makeup brush and then out of all 4 of my siblings (3 are girls) she blamed ME and threatened to shave my head if i didnt return it. also i had a camera in my living room but it got tooken down a LONG time ago but she claims she saw me holding it on the camera as an excuse to hit me ground me and force me to stay in my room. i know shes lying cuz i told her i took the camera down and then she admitted to lying but said it was my fault then started guilt tripping me. obviously i didnt fall for her bullshit sob story so she punched my face.   


its so frustrating cuz she thinks she can just play with me like a little doll and hit me whenever she feels and ground me and do WHATEVER. in her mind im not her child im like a pet and she owns me. im a person too. im crying while writing this because i cant take this anymore i wanna kill myself. i started cutting a year ago and quit but then today i relapsed. whats even worse is that i cant even cut myself right because it just doesnt even bleed anymore. i cant do anything right. i bet if i were to try kms again i would fail at that too. i already tried killing myself when i was 9 and twice this year. im really close to doing it for real this time i already planned how and everything. i started doing drugs too. i used to vape but i cant anymore because  im so used to doing it constantly i feel sick just by smelling it. so now i smoke cigarettes which are even worse and i just tried weed a few days ago. but since i dont have access to either i just pinch, hit, and cut myself. and its all because of my mom. why does my mom hate me?? she treats my siblings like shit too but she would NEVER hate them as much as she hates me and my sister. i remember when my sister was around 9 and i was 7 and she had these gifts her friends gave her when she was sick right? well my cheap ass mom was gonna give my SISTERS GIFTS to our cousin cuz her birthday happened to be soon. when she figured out my sister opened it cuz she didnt know our mom was giving HER OWN GIFT to our cousin, she dragged her off her bed sat ontop of her and punched her in the face over and over and over and over again. i just remember us crying and being terrified. she didnt seem like a mother she seemed like a monster. not only that but she would always tell us when we were younger ""dont tell ur friends at school what happens at home sweetie!"" and now i know why. because shes an abusive little bitch that tried hiding it. she would make us wear makeup to school to hide bruises and i dont get how a person could hit their own child. especially because im still a kid. i just turned 13. and ppl who JUST turned 13 shouldnt already be trying to kill theirself.  


 also we already had cps called on us like 50 times but she constantly would make us lie and convince them how much of an AMAZINGG mom she is! but in reality i wish i had my neighbors mom because shes so nice and when i told her what happened she hugged me and started comforting me. obviously she doesnt like my mom either cuz my best friend told me (its her mom) that she was gonna call cps on my mom cuz the abusive shit she does. also pretty sure the reason my mom hates me is cuz she thinks im gay which is strange because she ALSO thinks everything i do is to impress guys. like when i told her i got sexually assulted she said it was my fault because im a slut and i shouldnt have worn what i was wearing. what the actual FUCK mom. infact i dont even wanna call her my mom. FUCK HER!!  
shes so lucky i havent called cps on her ass MYSELF and tell them everything she does. but the reason i dont is because im scared. im scared they wont do anything and im scared she will hurt me when they leave. she already threatened to kill me twice and threw a knife at me before which is kinda funny but also fucked up because i was 12. she also says shes christian and when i told her i dont believe in god she grounded me. does she think thats gonna change my opinion?? not only does she ground me for the most stupid shit ever but she finds ANY way she can to yell at me. like an hour ago i was just simply eating a cookie in the kitchen right? she started SCREAMING at me telling me ""I TOLD YOU TO THROW THOSE AWAY"" when she NEVER said that, plus they arent even mine. when i told her she was lying and making crap up for no reason she got silent. after being silent for like 10 seconds i could tell she was trying to find another way to yell at me because she started looking around. then grounded me because ""my eyebrows look different"" WHY THE FUCK DID I GET GROUNDED BECAUSE MY EYEBROWS APPARENTLY LOOK DIFFERENT EVEN IF THEY DID THATS NOT MY FAULT OR A VALID REASON TO GROUND SOMEONE??   


anyways im in my room while writing this cuz again im grounded for ""giving her attitude"" when i only talked to her ONCE today. she also took away every single electronic i own so im doing this secretly lol. please give me a reason not to kill myself. im telling u guys cuz my irl friends cant relate and i dont wanna bring them down too just because MY life is fucked up. and whenever i try to talk about it to them they dont seem like they care that much tbh. or they just dont know what to say because what SHOULD u say if ur friend admits being constantly abused to you. anyways dont tell me ""OMG UR FRIENDS ARE SOO TERRIBLE DROP THEM NOW"" because they arent the problem, not the reason im being abused and its just not their fault in general. and dont tell me to tell my mom how i feel because she simply doesnt care or just laughs at me when i speak up. she'll never change.  
thank you so so so so much for reading this please give me advice before i swallow all of these pills lol",1660461058.0,trauma

I've made a post like this before and I'm back because it's worse, I'm going to keep this shorter then my other post because I just don't want to remember it but your free to go read it. In a short my mother is a very gaslighting, my way or the highway kind of person. She'll make you feel like shit just to get her way, she'll make you terrified of her just to get her way. She's always throwing harsh insults at me. She used to hit me until I was bruised but she stopped but I don't want to grow up looking down at my arms remembering where bruises and self harm marks were. I'm so tired it's not something I can take anymore it's not. I pray that God takes me away everyday. I'm homeschooled and I have no friends and I'm not allowed to leave the house. I'm not allowed to talk to any family apart from who's in the house. Which is only my mother father and sister. They've always been so much nicer to my sister. There's always been moments where she has not respect for anyone or anything yet my parents just let her be. She'll say stuff like I don't love you to my mother. She'll drop drinks and glasses and through all of this she won't get yelled at. My father is always busy if it comes to me. He's like a stranger in my house at this point. I feel like he doesn't even know me. My sister being as spoilt as she is purposely gets me in trouble sometimes. If I were to even drop a little bit of water my mother would tell me how annoying and worthless I am. She does it in such a toxic way She'll say it in an indirect way so that if I ever bring it up she'll say l never said that. Like when I was younger she hit me so hard and said she couldn't care about me unless I was passed out on the ground. I brought it up and told her she didn't care about me unless I was dying and that she said that herself but she just said she never said that but she did. I always hear people saying they have a mother or father like mine and that they understand but they don't. They're no being homeschooled by that toxic women. Their not taking tests under her watch. Your not staying in the house 24/7 with her. It's not like you don't see your cousins. I'm so tired of people telling me they understand but they don't and they always say that I am just being ungrateful or dramatic. I've done school from 7am -3am because my mother broke a glass and was in a bad mood. I was only 7. I ended up with so many harsh words and bruises that night.  I'm so tired I know people are going to say it'll get better.  I can't wait for it to get better its been like this since I was 7 I wanted to end it all at 8 I've done self harm at 10 and attempted at 10. I'm 13 and I still suffering I can't call cps cus I don't want them to get in trouble, but I can't keep living like this. I don't know what to do it's so tiring I just want to quit idc if it'll get better I'm not waiting until 18 or 19 to move. I don't want to grow up with all of this trauma I just want out. I don't want to talk to them about it they won't understand. They don't care either. My mother has done alot for me such has convince my dad to get me and my sister phones and playstations. But money and expensive things can't make me forget and it can't make me forgive. It can't make me happier. It not like we have a big house or alot of expensive things.

Hello, to someone who might read this. 

It feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. 
I'm not professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don't tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it's not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the ""phase"" I have. 

But I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I'm going to. 
As long as that is impossible I'm trying to figure out what is going on with me on my own. 

I did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.

 I thought my issues weren't that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can't call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. 

Generally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it's gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. 

And now there are two parts of me fighting. 
The one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I'm exaggerating, that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. 

Im torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. 
I feel like no one could ever get me. 
Because my ""trauma"" doesn't feel validated. 
Even though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. 

It still feels like I don't deserve to be heard. 
Because on the surface everything was perfectly fine. 

And even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can't. I can't look at the positive aspects and live normally. 

It affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can't concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I'm constantly on guard and don't feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I'm hiding fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I'm at my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I'm not worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I'm not obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don't want them to think that what she does is real love. 

But the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a ""myself"" even exist? Can I ever be ""it""? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. 

I feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. 

Everything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. 
That's why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can't get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). 

I feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. 

Im doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can't do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. 

That was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. 

So, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?

 (I'll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I'm missing blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) 

It all started even before I was born. 
My parents found each other through friends and got together. 

My mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don't exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle's parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.
They got together and married. 

Then their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. 

Then I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. 
I never knew anything different. 

And as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the ""big"" service. 

And then the indoctrination started. 

I don't remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? 

I just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren't much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. 
Now it's easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. 
But at what price? 

It's scary to me that my memories are so blurry. 
I don't even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).

I just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god's eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. 
I wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. 
And I achieved that, I think. 

But now I hate my past self for caring so much.
 
So what where we taught there? 
God created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil's work) and even though they didn't say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the ""real"" truth and that every other church doesn't have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. 

We were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god's (the church's) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.

 So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don't have control about anything anyways. 

But we're still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a ""free will"" granted from god. 

While writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. 
And it was a core beliefe of mine. 

When an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can't anymore. 
And then everything shatters. 

Losing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. 

So in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you're not saved (because for someone who is ""really"" saved it's physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it's because god did it. 

You're never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You're even unable to think in the ""right, good way"". So you're basically nothing and unimportant. 

But when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you're worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. 

Another bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you're nothing but with god you're worthy. 
It makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. 

Who are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. 

That's why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying ""sh*t"" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. 

Because of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the ""world"" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). 

We weren't allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren't allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. 

So if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you ""fall in love"" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren't sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. 

We were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner's personality. 
They told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.

Another contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think ""wow I really value my partner as a person"". 
No, they're s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). 

No one is appreciating anything. 
And if they are, they're VERY lucky. 

Because there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. 

Girls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. 
And if you're all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn't want you, wouldn't he? 

We were told we were pure glasses of water. 
And if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. 

But the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That's why there should be only one guy from the start. 

So that you don't end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. 
Now I know it's bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. 

We were told to cover up so guys don't sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren't tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. 

And if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you'd get in trouble for it.

I was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I'm glad mine wasn't as controlling as others and didn't force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. 

I was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that's the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn't really enjoy). 

So there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. 

With 12 you move from being with children to the ""big"" service and you're finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. 

But then you're also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. 

When I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to ""work"".)

Because in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I'd be called that it would curse me. 

I did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be ""myself"", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn't do that, because no one can ). 

I thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was ""myself"" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. 

And I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn't notice at the time. 

People abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you're not inviting people. 

I'm so glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. 
Which I was for being in that ""church"". 
And they told me early on: it's a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. 
But we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. 

School was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. 
And even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn't feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren't allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. 

And that's why my definition of ""home"" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. 

So what was living in my ""home"" like? 

I'm the first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I'm told is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.

When I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. 

So I just learned to not show my emotions at all at ""home"". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. 

My father was in control of everything and to this day he's still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. 
And he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. 

He is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. 

My parents (more my father) still don't want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can't ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. 

As I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn't have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that's what god made us for. 

Popping out babies, cleaning und cooking. 

But I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. 

And then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? 

In church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. 

Because your husband is by god's law above you and there to ""lead"" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can't decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don't have control anyways. 

That's why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what's going on.

I idolized my father until the realization that we don't have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. 

I had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn't find anything. 

He wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. 
In front of him I am what he wants me to be. 

I don't know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I'm honestly sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. 

I could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. 

Whenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. 

And that's why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I'm highly dependent. 

Another thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife's home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). 

When I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. 

And in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.

I know that I was sad but I somehow can't really recall my immediate emotions from that day. 

And I thought I'm glad that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn't able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn't cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn't think about it for years. 

But when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. 

It was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn't I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn't process properly. 

Then three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. 

When I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). 

Back to the cult. 
So am I still there? No. 

My parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September 2018 we drove away and never came back. 

And many others left too. 
We still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don't want to confront my parents.
 
I really don't want to be there because every time we're there I'm not really there. I'm just a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I'm always completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. 

I don't know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can't control it. 

And sometimes I'm just sad for no reason, I still can't sleep and still get a massive headache and can't stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn't and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can't stop. 

And it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn't understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am really grateful for. 

And something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. 

Now I can control if I'm going to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.

When my father is mad at me because I didn't do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it's disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn't stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It's the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. 

There are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am and then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I'm the best daughter someone could have and that he's so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. 

But on the inside I think: ""if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don't of, you wouldn't talk to me anymore"". 

He is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. 

And also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: ""I'm sorry but it's too late."" 

I don't have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. 

The first 16 years of my life partly wasted. 
I feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. 
And I know it's technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. 

And it makes me so mad that I was born because of the ""church"". Because they convinced my father to have children. 
I was cursed before I even existed. 

And still. 

I can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. 

All of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. 

There is no moment in my life where I wasn't afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.

And it was so frightening, because when it's out that you messed up you can't attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that's when people know. They see that you're not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course ""premarital s*x!!!"" 

When a couple did it (and someone found out) it's made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. 

And I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.

 I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.

 My parents and everyone in church who was ""responsible"" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a ""bad influence"" away from me. 

But I still watched what I wasn't allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. 

Basic knowledge like: it's okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.
 
And now? I just want to move out and study something so I'm always safe. I can't wait for the day where I'm finally going to be financially independent and don't have to rely on my father.

Wow it feels good put all of that in words. 

When you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. 

I just wish I could get help.


update: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn't wait any longer (I was stubborn). 
So now i'm going to therapy.

I'm 20. DONT tell me ""you have so much life to live"" and ""you're so young"". I get it. But I want to tell you, the life that I have lived has been plagued by monsters, childhood rapes, fear of other children, defending my family, internalizing religious trauma, and living a life of always feeling like an ""other"".

I've been beat by electrical cords, hangers, toy lightsabers, brooms, an arrow used with a bow (those leave welts). I've had bruises the sizes of dinner plates and welts to match. I remember as a little kid, making a game of what color my bruises were going to turn. Would they turn purple or red or yellow or even be like a fun little rainbow??

This life has fucked my brain up. It has turned it onto a permanent danger mode. Danger mode is permanently on after being abused.. Going to work? DANGER MODE. Being around friends? DANGER MODE. Talking to customers? DANGER MODE. Leaving my house? DANGER MODE. Staying in my house with my head under the covers while I'm typing this on my phone? DANGER MODE. Anything related to sex? DANGER MODE. 

FUCK. THIS. LIFE.

WHAT AM I EVEN LIVING FOR?? IM NOT EVEN LIVING. I AM IN A FROZEN SPOT IN LIFE. I HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME POSITION FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND I LOOK BACK AND SEE MONTHS OF MY LIFE JUST WASTED.. ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS TRAUMA. 

I look at the world through the lense of a child who's expecting abuse. Screaming. Pain.

I'm afraid of going out and I've also had extreme seizures from the drugs I was given at the time or the severe mental toll I don’t know. I've attempted to kill myself 3 times over my life.

And well, I've volunteered at safe homes and in activism against DV and have experienced and heard that people just walk straight through restraining orders. I want closure, but I only have to the end of this year to have a viable victim assist claim to help with legal and health fees, writing a crime report with so much pushback and violent confrontation is so so scary.

I have proof in messages and there is a witness (One of their friends though) but I'm so afraid I'll fail and the abuse will start again.

I fucking ran so hard, I've been running all my life and it's all I can do. Disgusting that there are so much injustice and the people that commit and they can live so well, clear of mind and guilt when I am suffering and feeling like I am already dying every day. I've been thinking more and more that the pain I live with every day is more than enough to point towards suicide. Suicide where it's my right, my last compassionate, able and merciful right to my abused body. I need to be put down, I'm already a dying fucking dog.

My dad was my best friend, we would do so much together. Hunting, fishing, biking, hiking, sports.  He would take us all (brother, sister, mom) out on family trips and vacations. My dad would always come home from work and have a couple beers, and my mom would insist on him having a problem with alcohol and needing rehab.  I personally only remember ever seeing my dad drunk once.  But my dad listened to her and went to rehab and quit drinking.  He had PSTD from the serving in Desert Storm, and depression from childhood traumas, so the doctors prescribed him Prozac.  He was sober for 3 years. My dad was my best friend don’t get me wrong, but I was also a mammas boy. I remember about 9-10 months into his recovery, my mom and him were arguing on the couch.  I (12yr old at the time) don’t exactly remember what they were arguing about, but my mom brought up divorce.  My dad responded,
Depressed in the face, that If she divorces him, that he will kill himself, then walked away.  With my dads only family being us, and being in his first year of sobriety, I know how hard emotionally that must of hit him.  But he should have never threatened my mom like that.  And my mom should have never turned to me and asked me my opinion. Asked me if I thought he was bluffing, or if he was being serious.  Me 12(M) taking my moms side, as I would most of their arguments, young and so trustworthy of my mom, she could do no wrong.  I agreed that she should divorce him.   Thinking back to this day I don’t see much my dad did wrong in their marriage, it was a lot of my mom.  And my dad would always tell me after their arguments, knowing i didn’t get it yet, he would look at me and say “I know you’re young and don’t understand a lot of this sh*t, but I know you see it, and when you get older you’re gonna look back and be like “holy sh*t dad you were right.””.
And I do so often seeing my mom now that I’ve matured.   So my parents ended up legally getting a divorce, dad moving out to a new apartment right next to my Highschool.  I was 13 now getting ready to start my freshman year.  Things happened so quick, I adjusted to it so fast.  I remember going over to my dads apartment after school to find weed on the kitchen counter and beer in the fridge, he had started his relapse and it did not raise a single concern to me.   He had stopped taking the medication prescribed for his mental health too.  Leading side affect was depression/suicide.  He met this girl about an hour away,
And they moved very quickly.  This lady was 
not his type (bigger/thicker, redneck, just a scary looking face) not to be rude, but just not his type.  He moved in with her after a few weeks, and then they brought up getting married, but said it was being planned 8 months out.   Next weekend they were married.. he told me she almost forced him to the court house after work one day, still in work clothes, they got legally married.  In the next month they’d buy a house.  I remember the first trip to the house, my dad seemed weird,  he was extremely excited to have me down there visiting, wanted to make it a weekend for the books.  We went zip lining, went to the beach had a bonfire, rode ATVs, and one thing I’ll never forget is he took us shooting. More so never forgetting him handing me the 357. Revolver,
The same one he would be using 3 days later to take his life.   Just about as vividly as i remember him handing me that gun, I can see the image of him using it on himself, Not just one way, 100s of different ways, things he was saying, things he was thinking, crying or not crying, what part of the head he pressed the gun against.  14yrs old until now at 22yrs old it’s still something that crosses my mind.

When I was born, I nearly died. According to my mother the umbilical cord wrapped itself around my neck 5-6 times and it was a struggle to take it off. It nearly choked me to death though sadly enough the doctors cut it off my neck just in time. I was born a female to my mother and biological father who probably didn't want me to start with, but we'll get to him later in the post. Growing up, my mother worked in education as a daycare worker and eventually grew up to be the head of reading coaches in her district. When I wasn't even three years old, she noticed as I was playing in the playground with the other children that I was limping extremely badly and wondered if something was up so she sent me to the hospital for an x-ray of my bones. Apparently a small hole had begun forming in my left hip and was the very beginning of hystosytosis, so she had to take a week off of work and I had to undergo surgery ASAP. Sadly even then I didn't die from the anesthesia they gave me when I went under the knife, survived, and began walking about three days later after the surgery. People called it a miracle. I really wish I had died then because the doctor said that was definitely  a risk and had I survived I would need serious physical therapy for months, if not longer. So there's that.

As I got older, it became apparent that I was struggling with some sort of neurodivergency that was initially first believed to be some form of ADHD due to me being unable to sit still in class and focus on what the teacher was saying. I was smart as a whip and I still am (I guess? Mom doesn't really think the same of me in that regard anymore), but when kt came to interacting with other kids, I struggled with nonverbal communication and facial expressions, as well as socialization with my peers and being quote on quote, """"normal"""" like them. 

This was when I began bouncing from school to school to find a good fit since teachers and students alike were beginning to treat me like shit because of my differences. I was put in timeout and in hallways for being unable to listen and focus, as well as being accused of things I never did and teachers siding with the bullies instead of me because some of the teachers didn't really like me or my mom because of how frequently she had to come up to my schools to defend me and clear up the bullying I dealt with almost all the time. I went to speech therapy at my second elementary school and was assisted by a rather racist white school therapist who accused me of being the victim because I got bullied all the time and didn't stand up for myself, even though a student tried to stab me the week before. She diagnosed me with Asperger's in 4th grade, but this was never officially diagnosed by a neuroscientist or anyone who works with behaviour. This did, however, give schools access to my IEP to take me out during classes to help me with my mental, social, and emotional issues. After my last year at this school, I moved to being homeschooled for a year by my mother and great grandmother, which actually went well for the most part. Learned more then than when I was in public school.

And then I got accepted into a private school (that is now closed thank god) for the rest of my junior high years. The school was quite small, maybe 30 people in every grade maximum. But even then, I was bullied, isolated, and ignored for my hyperfixations and being different. It began calming down around 8th grade, but it still didn't change the hurt. Just before I hit the 7th grade, I had came out to my mom as bisexual (long before I came out to her as a nonbinary trans man) and she immediately asked if I had gotten violated or if someone talked me into being bisexual. Confused, I said no. She then asked if I was sexually attracted to her or my sister and accused me of incest. Disgusted at this point, I said no. She immediately blamed me talking to my online friends during the time for influencing me to become bisexual and banned me from talking to them for years, though I consistently sneaked on when she wasn't looking. For background, she was raised a fundamentalist Baptist under my great grandfathers church and was raised to believe the homophobic, transphobic bullshit that the Bible spews. She was disgusted that I liked girls to say the least. This was when the verbal, emotional, and mental abuse began. 

When I graduated 8th grade, I began going to a center where I met other teens my age. This was when I met my very first boyfriend, we'll call him L. He was immediately smitten with me the moment he saw I was playing Pokemon (still a huge fan of it to this day) and wanted to date me and get to know me more. He had and still does have great qualities about him, but during the time he suffered greatly with DID, ADHD, bipolar disorder and autism, as well as anxiety and depression. And while I was not officially diagnosed with anything other than autism yet, I was dealing with gender dysphoria, depression, anxiett, and bad bad insonmia. His DID often came about in the form of alters, one alter in particular named Damien who often threatened suicide and verbally abused me. Keep in mind I wasn't even 15 yet when I began dating him. This also resulted in him becoming a giant bully, often cutting me off for months at a time until he felt like talking to me again and resulting in us getting into giant arguments. Due to my forgiving nature and believing people could changed, I forgave him multiple times. Over and over and over and over and over again. This also began to break my psyche.

When I was 14, I got into apprenticeships with other teenagers, my first program being a creative writing program. This was when I met the first trans person I ever knew who's name was Harmony. He was a white trans guy and he spoke vocally about his queerness and it always intrigued me. How could someone be so proud of something that is a choice and that God considered sin? (At this point I was pushed back into the closet by my homophobic and eventually transphobic mother. I was in denial). I began talking to him about it and luckily he was very open to answering questions. I asked him why did he identify as trans and why was he proud of it? How he discovered he was a man? After about an hour of us talking, I left with a lot of new knowledge and realizations about myself. I was never ecstatic about puberty. As a matter of fact it was absolutely horrifying to me, especially female puberty. I was an early bloomer so it made me hate it more when people mistook me for being much older than what I was and began sexualizing my body at a young age. Even if that wasn't happening, I did not like my chest and I DEFINITELY did not like having a period. I always wanted to be more like the men in physicality and in confident but I couldn't be. Why did I feel this way?

That's when it hit me. I'm fucking trans.

And I had to keep it from my family as long as possible.

Fastforward to when I was 15, I left the first high school I was at due to travel issues and attended an online school where I would eventually finish with a high GPA and honours. I attended a space for teens in a library and often went to their homeschool group and it was actually quite fun. I got to know so many different kinds of people there from all different races, nationalities, cultures, sexualities, genders and faith. It was so exciting to meet new people, new people that actually wanted to know me for me. This space was also a strong safe space for LGBTQIA+ people, and this was the time I began discovering different gender identites and sexualities. I began experimenting with multiple nonbinary identities and began identifying as pansexual before it was eventually tainted by family. This time around we were going on a field trip to a Zine Fest on the lower west side of the city, the type of fest that is predominantly filled with queer people. I loved it there. I bought a lot of merchandise that day, including a pansexual sticker that I had put on top pf my green flannel shirt. I went home with the sticker still on my shirt, completely forgetting to remove it before I got home. My parents eventually googled the colours of the sticker when I didn't tell them what it meant and my mother immediately began calling me a degenerate, saying I have no standards and would fuck animals and kids cuz I have no preference. Which incited an argument and having to explain to her I was also trans. She called me one of Satan's minions, brainwashed by media, and that I'll be an ugly tranny of a man. I was crushed. and my grandmother joined in on the throwing of slurs as well because their religion dictates I am going to hell for being who I am. They told me God doesn't want this in his plan and I need to abide by the Bible. I snapped off, saying I didn't believe in God and that God is a cruel God. They threatened to kick me out once I was 16 because it was legal in the state I live in and still currently live in, and that if I don't believe in God I'll be thrown into the streets. I was so scared and hurt by the abuse being thrown my way for coming out. I had my social media and technology taken away from me and couldn't get back on it for another year all because of this and she nearly took away my opportunity with a programming apprenticeship. My biological dad around this time, who had suddenly come back into my life, knocked up a bitch he barely knew and had the baby, preferring his new son to the son he already had that was trying his best to be a good member to society. He hasn't talked much to me since.

So for the sake of my safety, I became hyperfem and shoved myself back into the closet. I pretended to believe in God again and accept Christ into my heart just so they wouldn't hate me and kick me out. I am 16 at this point. I date men here and there as a cis appearing woman, but whenever I tell them I'm trans, they get disgusted and run away. Later that year, I graduate high school early and get sent off to a junior college to complete my gen eds and get a degree. I meet a man named Kenneth who approaches me in a bad boy esque way and a week later asks for me to marry him in the hallway of my college. My parents grow to like him and we end up traveling all around the city together. I was scared to tell him I wad trans until about three months later as he identified as a cishet man. It brings about major problems thay devolve into arguments and transphobia that I won't get into, as well as issues sexualizing my chest. We decide to take a break and this is when I meet my boyfriend now turned friend, Speedy. We hang out a lot and like each other a lot, but eventually that didn't work out as a romantic relationship either because of me being trans since he's not into men. 

At this point during my college career I am struggling in my classes because of managing a job and dealing with abuse at home, so I begin to fail. I eventually drop out in favor of working a full time job, but that never comes to fruition as I am unwillingly brought into a bank fraud scheme that took all the money I earned away from my account, forcing me to quit my job and close my bank account for good. I have nothing to do now and I am stuck at home with no education or job. My mother and father begins abusing me even more for losing the job, my money, and dropping out of college because of mental health reasons. I am called slurs yet again, lazy, unmotivated, fat, retarded (nice thing to say to an autistic kid, right) and a plethora of other insults and slurs. As well as shaming me for not having a job. I begin turning to self harm again and substances to cope with the dailt abuse and beratement. I still do to this day.

Come 2019, I discover a workforce program that honestly changes my life for the better that helps me gain the job skills needed to keep a job in the field of Information Technology. Even then, my parents stalk me, abuse me, and call me slurs recklessly for attending the LGBT club there and calling me demonic and evil for being a Luciferian witch during the time due to invading my privacy and actually calling up to one of the social workers I worked with during the time outting me as a witch. (According to my parents anyway. They've always been liars). Summer comes and I am promoted to an internship as a field technician at an esteemed university. But due to what happened for months before I got the internship plus the crippling dysphoria and suicidal ideation I was dealing with, I break down during my shift and attempt to slit my neck later that night. I eventually report this to my program and I am immediately hospitalized for five days. After coming out of the hospital, I am thrown into group therapy. Just to tell you, the doctors never acknowledged gender dysphoria as the cause for my issues, call it a cosmetic issue, and instead diagnose me with depression and psychosis, which doesn't help. My father then gets angry at me for my attempt, calling me evil, demonic, selfish, and self centered, among telling me that my transition is evil and doesn't matter and is selfish because of THEIR feelings and beliefs about it. So I ended up crying for the rest of the day about that.

Fast forward to the end of the year, I get accepted back into the program and begin interning somewhere else before the pandemic began. During 2020, I am forced to work from home remotely until June of 2020... during May of 2020, I had left my house to stay over my friends houses to escape their abuse and medically transition. During this time, I almost do start my transition but then they begin harassing me over the phone and blowing up my calls, commanding me I go home before police are called. I left my friends home before they actually did. I was so scared. 

I graduate my program in late July and begin job hunting with little to no luck until i come across a covid-19 contact tracing job that paid well, but due to shitty management and training, I lose the job in a matter of two months and get vehemently blamed for it due to mistakes I didn't know about and poor training that was not my fault. A month after losing my job, my grandpa dies of covid and my mom steals my money to pay his funeral expenses WITHOUT MY FUCKING PERMISSION. Back in April, my aunt died of covid so this was just another big blow. I have been two months without a job now or any sanity. My parents refuse to allow me to transition under their house and they don't care if I kill myself anymore or go into a shelter. Honestly I want to kill myself. For years I wanted hormones and surgery and all they did was abuse, silence, gaslight, and threaten me. Now their excuse is that I'm an adult. If I'm an adult then why can't I make an informed choice on my body? Why can't I at least attempt to be happy? I have been sniffing and consuming cleaning products to cope and have been crying myself to sleep every day and night for three months now. i want this pain to end. I already overdosed recently on bleach before and I might do it again. If I can't transition, I'll kill myself. I refuse to live as a woman any longer or with this pain of knowing I'll never be anyone's son, boyfriend, or nephew. I rather die than wait it out anymore. I should've died at birth. I should've died in surgery. I should've died when I was 12.

I'm eighteen.

I graduated from high school last year, and am currently taking a gap year. I leave for Africa in less than a month. Then it's off to college (CU Boulder). I currently work at a bookstore.

I have been struggling with depression for a lot of years, but i could never muster up the courage to talk to anyone until recently, after my girlfriend, who also happens to be one of my best friends, broke up with me. (more on this later)

I have seen multiple therapists in the past (by choice), and only one of them was able to actually understand my nature. But my parents, who want to do everything in their power to help me, refuse to let me see him on the grounds that they feel that whenever I would leave sessions with him I would act audaciously (I saw him originally because I can't talk to my parents for the life of me).

Since me and my girlfriend broke up (let's call her Jenn), I have slipped deeper into depression than I have ever been. The only thing that i have had to eat in the last three days has been a couple of donuts, which I promptly threw back up at around 5:30 this morning. I can't sleep for more than four hours without crying. I'm in so much pain. I have cut myself before, and have been contemplating suicide for years. I just want help. 

There were times when i wasn't nice to Jenn. We fought, like a normal couple. We both had our moments. She was the only person I ever spoke to about my feelings. She was always so nice. and made me so happy, and I just tried to push her away. The two weeks before we broke up, I hardly spoke with her. I hated myself for doing it. I don't know why I did. But there was a force in my mind that prevented me. At the end of the two weeks, she went to visit her sisters at school (they attend the same university). I was so upset. I wanted to talk to her again, but I couldn't. So, being the ass hole that I am, I was mean to her. I went to bed that night so sad and angry at myself. I felt like the worst person in the world, and I didn't know how to fix it. 
The next day, she drove home, so i figured we could go and work everything out, like we always do. I went to her house, and we both apologized and hugged and made up (or so I thought). She (who has also been struggling with depression for years) then kept talking about the times that I was mean. She started to cry and told me that she needed time. I told her that was completely fine, and that I will be gone for five months come November. And that I loved her. Then she told me that she wanted to break up. She said she couldn't handle the fact that she was my only emotional outlet, and that she would fall apart when I left (which i found odd, because I mean, breaking up?) But that she still loved me and cared about me with every ounce of passion that she used to. I was (and still am) so overwhelmed with sadness. And confusion. And more pain than I have ever experienced.

I know that I'm only eighteen. And this is bullshit high school romance. But the only thing I really want is someone to come home to. Someone that I really care about. And that I really love. It's killing me inside. I have even considered canceling the trip based on the fact that there's no way I could possibly be safe in this frame of mind. And because I don't want to lose her. 

I'm so sad, and scared, and overwhelmed, and I feel dead inside. And so does she. I don't know what to do, and i need help. 

I don't want to die.

137,1553.0,I think I'm only transitioning because the combination of my personality and trauma makes being a guy in this society worse than death,9,kplwez,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kplwez/i_think_im_only_transitioning_because_the/,3,"I don't really know where to post this but I figured this would be the best place.

In primary school I was extensively bullied. Physically and verbally. I often ended up crying. The issue is no one gave a shit. The verbal bullying was mostly from girls, and the physical from boys. I remember once saying something back to one of the girls who frequently made me cry that made her cry, and I got chastised heavily for it by the teacher. The teacher never cared when she or any of the other girls or boys made me cry.

I was also attacked quite a lot by my brother at home who was 3 and a half years older than me. He would really beat the shit out of me sometimes, and I'd be scared for my life. I remember one time lying on my back on the floor with him pinning my arms down with his arms and his knee on my neck, my eyes slowly closing involuntarily before he decided to get off me. This all happened with other adults around and sometimes in the same room my Mum, my Dad, family friends etc. ""Boys will be boys"". I would sometimes beg them to help and scream that I was so scared he was gonna kill me this time but they would never care enough to do anything more than leave the room.

So I was abused extensively as a teenager by my Mum, with my Mother consistently reminding me that no one would ever believe I was an abuse victim because I was male. This was proven absolutely correct when she once got drunk and called the police on me when I was 15 because I refused to come out of my room. They arrived, asked her what was going on and she said I was abusing her. They came into my room and told me that I might be a child now but if I hit my mum when I reached 16 they would arrest me and I would have a criminal record for the rest of my life. I said I have never once hit her ever, but I have photos of injuries that she has inflicted upon me and witnesses of this happening. She clarified to them that I had been ""emotionally abusing"" her by refusing to come out of my room, not even for meals, and never talking to her. I told them again that I have photos of injuries she has inflicted upon me and witnesses to this happening and I got the images up on my phone to show them. They waved their hands dismissively at me and said ""it's fine we're not going to press any charges against you for the moment, but you need to be nicer to your Mum"" then left my room. And then came back in and said ""btw your Mum told us that at one point you tried to run away, I think you should be aware that if you do then you will be deemed to have made yourself intentionally homeless and will therefore be unable to receive any government support, look we get a lot of calls about teenage boys in your position being like this so just don't"" and then they left. 

So despite me knowing my rights, being completely unconvinced by her trying to convince me it was my fault, and knowing I didn't deserve this. I was stuck being extensively domestically abused for 5 years (13-18) because I was a guy. The police were very explicit about the fact that it was because I was a guy. And I know that would absolutely not have happened to me if I was a 15 year old girl and my Dad was physically abusing me and I had evidence and witnesses to it

I had friends though, people I could reach out to that I was close with. And I did, and they were supportive, and then they just got kinda bored. Everyone was going through puberty, there was an overabundance of people feeling sorry for themselves. The guys would rather support girls because it gave them that white knight feeling, and the girls would rather support girls because it was something they could relate to more and it made them uncomfortable to hear a) about just how shit my situation was and b) the fact I was suggesting that this particular individual circumstance that I faced was worse because I was a guy than this exact situation would have been for me if I was a girl was ""a bit anti-feminist"" so there went all my support for that. I was still my female friend's go to for whenever they had a problem but they wouldn't let me talk about mine anymore. 

Then I got a girlfriend, we'd both had a crush on each other for 5 years, but they'd rejected me initially cos they thought I deserved someone better and then they confessed that they had liked me the whole time and asked me out. And it was great, to begin with, and then they started getting sexually explicit texts from other guys that they personally knew and at first I was nothing but sympathetic but then I found out this wasn't people messaging her out of the blue this was people she engaged in regular conversation with coming onto her and her not telling them to stop. I asked her if she could tell them to stop but she never did, it just continued for the whole of our relationship. 

We'd been doing everything except penetrative sex for a while and we were both comfortable with that and then she told me that she wanted to have sex soon and I said I was happy to if she was, then she said that she couldn't wait to tell her friends because so far only one person in her friendship group was having sex and it would be great to have some stories of her own. This made me really uncomfortable and I said I didn't want to have sex if she was gonna tell her friends about it the second we did. After a month she finally agreed she wouldn't tell her friends and we had sex the next week. Then the very next day she told her friends ""by accident"". 

Then she started getting bored of me. Apparently I was ""too nice"" but she said it was mainly that she wanted to be more adventurous with other people. So she broke up with me, then got back with me, about 5 times. After the 3rd time she asked me in frustration why I didn't fight for her when she broke up with me. 

Then I went to uni. I ended up making friends with a group of people who seemed really nice and were by themselves, but as the only white guy in the group, the butt of everyone's jokes about how I probably didn't deserve my place here, my life was so much easier than everyone else's etc. All of these people knew about my past extensively. They just didn't care. I was a guy, so my life was easy. 

Then I got a girlfriend at uni, she was the one to ask me out. She knew everything about me and my past, all the things detailed previously before we went out. Things were great initially, then she asked me to initiate more cos it apparently made her feel shit that I didn't initiate as often. So I did. She also asked me if it was okay for her to call me sir in bed sometimes and I said yeah sure I mean whatever gets people off. After a few months she started to get more distant after sex and said that sometimes she just feels weird and kinda sensory overloady after sex. Then it progressed to her not wanting to hold hands or touch any time we weren't having sex. And eventually to her recoiling when I accidentally touched her. She then told me she had been groped by her teacher at school and had just started thinking about it again. She didn't mention the fact she called me sir in bed but I could put two and two together and work out that she'd been using me to fulfill an abuse fantasy. So I just started saying no to sex whenever she initiated it. She was also the clearest example of explicitly telling me to not talk about my problems please after she'd spent the entire first half of our relationship talking about how suicidal she was and how she once attempted suicide. This applied to her male friends as well, one of whom attempted suicide while we were together and her primary reaction was *oh for fuck sake, he's such a moron*, but not her female friends who she always had time for even if the problem was just that they'd been overthinking a bad conversation with their parents. 

When we finally had the conversation that culminated in us breaking up I asked her if she could initiate more, cos at the beginning she had initiated all the time and asked me to initiate more, and I'd done that but now she had stopped initiating and I was the only one that did. And she said she prefers relationships where only the guy initiates. 

My friends who were friends with my girlfriend (both school and uni) never stopped being friends with them. Even after finding out everything they had done and how they had treated me, and ditching guys who had done the same or equivalent to their girlfriends without a second glance, even if they were only friends with the original guy and not the girlfriend. 


I just can't handle being a guy. My life has been such shit and I have been treated so badly by people. And I know that isn't unique or even rare but what is rare is that not one of my friends has even thought to question their relationship with others who have treated me like shit when I have seen them drop guys who treat girls like that almost instantaneously.

I hate that my suffering is viewed as inherently less worthwhile or meaningful because I am a guy, that my emotions are somehow less valid, that I can't be a real victim, that I'm always either a neutral party or a perpetrator. Even going clubbing, and trying to get past a group, or going on a walk at night pre-covid, people would stare at me like I'm a rapist and cross to the other side of the street to avoid me. I can never be unhappy in a group situation with people I don't know because if I end up in a corner not really talking much people look at me like I'm a creep waiting for my chance to spring out of the shadows and rape someone when I'm really just too insecure to strike up a conversation, and no one initiates conversations with guys at parties anyway. Girls want to talk to girls and guys want to talk to girls. 

And I know the only chance of escaping all of this shit and make sure it doesn't just endlessly repeat until I die is if I transition and people start seeing me as a woman. 

And maybe it won't be enough, maybe it could have been if I'd started earlier but now I will still always have an imposing or threatening frame. But I have nothing to lose at this point. The way friends family teachers and all other authority figures have treated me as a guy is not worth trying to live with or figure out. I either need to change how society perceives me (ie switching to a gender where you aren't immediately deemed as entirely worthless if you don't have confidence) or die.",1609685847.0,trauma

I'm male and i born in 1996,  i was a wonderful, innocent and pure child.
I'm adopted since i'm 1 month yo, but i know my biological family, so, it's ok.
With my ""adopted"" family, i  was created freely, i could have fun whatever i want, i grow up playing a Atari console,SEGA Genesis, PS1, PS2 and PC. 
Well... my neighborhood was not so nice and i just understand it now where i'm with 21 yo.

Abuses:
The first abuse happened when i was 8yo,  they are all older than me (around 20yo), a guy told me to put my hand on his pocket and see what was there.
The second abuse happened when i was 10yo, i don't remember what i'm doing but this cant justify, three or four guys let me completely naked on the street and tied me up on a post, although it was during the night, people still passing by me and they  looked to a boy on the post like ""WTF"".
The third abuse was sexual, and i prefer to avoid this part.

* During my childhood, i met pornography. I utilized it until this year, when i identified my problems, as a scape. Due to this traumas, my mind utilized pornography as a way to feel ""more real"" or ""feel something"", but pornograhy isn't good after all. My prefere as (or is) cam girls, JOI, amateurs...the most immersive and pure is better.


Consequences:
During my teenager part, i started to cut myself a lot, just to ""feel something"" because my mind was completely turned off. I could not feel happiness, sadness or anything, i was just a complete void. On school, my ""friends""  cut me too because they want to know if that is true i could not feel anything, they cut me in a lot of ways, i still have some marks. As a teen, i faced it as a joke, but it was not.


Today: I'm 21, i recently graduated and licensed on molecular biology, i'm a student and researcher of bioinformatics. My instructor likes me and tell i'm talented on what i'm doing and people around me tell that i will have a great future. But i can't feel anything. Just sadness, hopeless and i think about suicide everyday.
My desire for suicide is worse when (for some reason) i have crisis, i don't know why, but i feel worse sometimes. I identify myself as straight, i have a GF now, but when i have these crisis my mind is just a mess, i don't know  who i am, my fully name, i don't know if i am male, female, straight, gay, bi or attack helicopter, i just don't know anything, i just think about die, kill and i feel rage and angry for one or two weeks. Most part of my success as student came from my revolt and attempt to be perfect, if i like something, i will be a fanatic for it.

* I lost a lot of people on my life, my biological mom, my old brother, my ""adopted"" father, my grandpa and the animals that i really loved. Also, my  other brother was addicted to drugs and killed a chicken in front of me, i cried for a long time ( i was 13yo). Today i live with my ""adopted"" mom only.

Only now i identified the origin of my problems, but i don't know how to ""fix""  these things and stay more closer to ""normal"".

I’m broken and I feel like there’s no repair. I carry the weight of the world on my own. I have no family I can count on. After years of emotional, physical and mental abuse I cracked at 31 years old. My oldest memory of abuse is 4 yo. I wanted to end it, never feel empty and discarded ever again.

I didn’t have much of an identity before but I was functional. I could get hurt by someone and walk away unphased and onto the next thing. Then I met my ex husband. Gave everything I had to him just for him to cheat the entire time we were together. Encouraged him towards a very lucrative career and took a back breaking job and took care of our kids our youngest being special needs. I supported him, I took his courses for him, even wrote his entrance essay for acceptance into a really prestigious school. 

All the while he was Screwing people left and right as I was being depleted of any human trace I had left. Working 16 hour nights and putting another 8 to ensure our children were taken care of. Blamed me for his cheating narcissistic ways. I worked too much and never looked at him. He hated me because he had to do the dishes. Had to watch our kids because I couldn’t walk after working 4 16 hour shifts back to back that even turning in bed caused me so much pain. 

“You never look at me.” I’m sorry, I was falling into a deep depression and I couldn’t get out. I begged him for help but was rebuffed and made to feel like it was all in my head. The only gift I wanted was to be left alone for my birthday, but that was me being selfish he said. 

I left when he slapped me the one and only time he’d ever done that. That was my final straw. 5 months after our separation, a fb message was sent to me on thanksgiving. “He was having an affair with me and I found out he cheated on me with another girl during his summer internship.” 

The pictures that came with it, no wife should ever see. Any semblance of sanity I had, broke. That summer, was unbearable. I couldn’t do it anymore... I lost control and FaceTimed him... hysterically yelling and crying. Says it’s a lie, even with picture proof. 

I went silent for 2 days and I cried for my father. The only time I had ever done that... I’d drive to work looking at anything sturdy to crash into. Kept thinking how easy it would be to just STOP feeling. Stop thinking, stop being hurt. I was alone sitting on my bed, contemplating taking pills. Leaving a note on my front door to call 911 and not let me children in.

My kids popping in and out of my mind. I can’t leave them. They need me. They’d hate me if I left them. 

I checked myself into a mental hospital... I needed to reset. Bring myself back but I can’t. My ex husband thinks I’m fine, my kids love me and I love them. 

For once...  I wish someone carried me. See me as being worth something... anything.",1588129841.0,suicide

147,1783.0,Brother no showed his own wedding.,7801,15jiazp,awfuleverything,https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/15jiazp/brother_no_showed_his_own_wedding/,480,"So my brother (38) has always been an arsehole but this is next level even for him.
He's a drinker that has had long stretches of sobriety before falling off the wagon pretty hard. He's been drinking again recently but during his stag doo a couple of weeks back he was completely well behaved. He was drinking most of the day was was perfectly pleasant and responsible to everybody and went to bed with no issues.

Now on top of all that he's never been completely trustworthy. Always doing the minimum amount of work he can to get by and often hooks up with the kind of women that are lonely and willing to do everything for him. For the last several years he's been with a very kind lady who still fits that description. This girl can do it all, painting, decorating, plumbing, fixing cars, anything she sets her mind too. Absolutely the opposite of my brother.

She asked him to get married and after he said yes she went to work, putting months of time and effort into planning and buying everything to make it perfect including his own suit, shoes ect and she was working overtime to make this happen.

The night before the wedding she was up late decorating the venue whilst he was at the pub having a few beers with the father of the bride and his best man. Around 12am those guys decided enough was enough and it was time for bed. My brother wanted to head into town and the guys were telling him not to be so stupid and escorted him to his hotel room.

Cut to around 8am the next morning. My sister is doing the bride's hair and make-up, my mother and auntie are dressing up the young bridesmaids and everybody there is as happy as you could imagine.
Meanwhile the father of the bride and the best man are unable to contact my brother and after gaining access to his room realise he's not there and the bed was clearly not slept in.

They start frantically trying to call and go out looking (service is at 12:30pm)
He finally answers at around 10:30 telling the best man to calm down he's coming back soon (there's music and laughter in the background and he's clearly at some kind of party) he then hangs up and turns his phone off.

An hour later there's still no sign and the guys make the decision to head to the ladies hotel next door and tell them what's happened.
I'm sure you can imagine the scene as such a happy morning turns to one of complete devastation. With the father and mother of the bride bawling into each others arms, the bride hysterical, being consoled by my sister and bridesmaids, my mother, auntie and the best man watching all of this and feeling heartbroken and also complete embarrassment.

It got to 12:15 with the bride holding out hope for those final few seconds before realising it was over and they had to cancel and that was that.
The next time my brother was seen was randomly by a wedding reception guest that turned up at the wrong hotel about 3:30pm.
He was drinking in a bar over the road on his own and when asked what the hell he was doing just played it off with ""Meh, what's all the fuss about. No big deal. We can do it anytime"" ect.

The guest left him to it and we all met at the reception. The bride had decided to go ahead as a thank you to those who'd made the effort to travel to be there, take days off ect but I'm sure you can imagine how it all went down with people randomly breaking into tears or getting angry throughout the night.

Now it's the next morning and the bride and her family travel home. My brother's outside the house complaining about being cold and to be let in.
However when he sees the faces of the bride, her father and her brothers, he swiftly turns on the waterworks and starts apologising to them all and how he didn't mean it. He basically got chased out of the street.

His bags were packed and thrown out on too the lawn.

His designer clothes and shoes that she has paid for over the years were sold on Facebook marketplace that afternoon.

He has no phone as he lost it at some point.

His bank account is empty as he spent everything on that one drinking session.

And he has nowhere to go. None of us would take him in and my mother is going to stay with her for a few weeks to take care of everything.

That's the story and now we're living with the aftermath. The news is all over Facebook and everyone is feeling heartbroken and humiliated.
My mother has always been a wonderful, kind hearted lady but has never been able to have a happy life.
Since she left my abusive father and his suicide she's been dealing with my brother's issues ever since.
I think she thought she'd finally got him over the finish line with this wedding and now that hope has turned to dust.

My thoughts are with her and his lovely would-be wife but I have a deep level of anxiety and dread over what happens now with my brother. He doesn't deserve to be allowed back into her life and obviously her family utterly despise him at this point along with most of my family, his friends and best man.

I hear a neighbour has put him up in a hotel outside of town for a few days (always a bleeding heart for him to turn to) to clear his head. However with no family, phone, home (it's in her name) car (it's in her name) or money I just can't see where he goes from here.

At almost 40 the days of him using his boyish good looks and charm to worm his way back in or elsewhere are pretty much done and the big fear is he goes down the same path his dad did.

The bride, my mother, sister and now possibly her mother (in his place) along with the kids. Are about to fly out on the honeymoon for ten days which I couldn't be happier about. That will really help them.

My brother however is now on his own, penniless, alone with his thoughts until he has to check out on Monday morning.

I have an overwhelming sense of anxiety and despair.

I’m broken and I feel like there’s no repair. I carry the weight of the world on my own. I have no family I can count on. After years of emotional, physical and mental abuse I cracked at 31 years old. My oldest memory of abuse is 4 yo. I wanted to end it, never feel empty and discarded ever again.

I didn’t have much of an identity before but I was functional. I could get hurt by someone and walk away unphased and onto the next thing. Then I met my ex husband. Gave everything I had to him just for him to cheat the entire time we were together. Encouraged him towards a very lucrative career and took a back breaking job and took care of our kids our youngest being special needs. I supported him, I took his courses for him, even wrote his entrance essay for acceptance into a really prestigious school. 

All the while he was Screwing people left and right as I was being depleted of any human trace I had left. Working 16 hour nights and putting another 8 to ensure our children were taken care of. Blamed me for his cheating narcissistic ways. I worked too much and never looked at him. He hated me because he had to do the dishes. Had to watch our kids because I couldn’t walk after working 4 16 hour shifts back to back that even turning in bed caused me so much pain. 

“You never look at me.” I’m sorry, I was falling into a deep depression and I couldn’t get out. I begged him for help but was rebuffed and made to feel like it was all in my head. The only gift I wanted was to be left alone for my birthday, but that was me being selfish he said. 

I left when he slapped me the one and only time he’d ever done that. That was my final straw. 5 months after our separation, a fb message was sent to me on thanksgiving. “He was having an affair with me and I found out he cheated on me with another girl during his summer internship.” 

The pictures that came with it, no wife should ever see. Any semblance of sanity I had, broke. That summer, was unbearable. I couldn’t do it anymore... I lost control and FaceTimed him... hysterically yelling and crying. Says it’s a lie, even with picture proof. 

I went silent for 2 days and I cried for my father. The only time I had ever done that... I’d drive to work looking at anything sturdy to crash into. Kept thinking how easy it would be to just STOP feeling. Stop thinking, stop being hurt. I was alone sitting on my bed, contemplating taking pills. Leaving a note on my front door to call 911 and not let me children in.

My kids popping in and out of my mind. I can’t leave them. They need me. They’d hate me if I left them. 

I checked myself into a mental hospital... I needed to reset. Bring myself back but I can’t. My ex husband thinks I’m fine, my kids love me and I love them. 

For once...  I wish someone carried me. See me as being worth something... anything.",1588129841.0,depression

When I got my first job I was dead set on saving up for one thing and one thing only I wanted to get myself a pair of colourblind glasses so that I could see a rainbow for the first time as its always something I've wanted to do. I had bought them a first time but they got lost in the mail before they even got into my country so I didn't think to much of it and I thought it jusr wasn't meant to be so I didn't end up buying a new pair. Skip ahead a few months and it's Christmas time and my parents and both pairs of my grandparents all came together and pitched in enough money for me to get a new pair and I was so happy cause this meant I could finally see a rainbow so I was basically jumping around with joy. I wore them everyday then school started again. My best friends brother who is also colourblind asked to see the glasses, now I don't mind letting people see them and since I knew he was colourblind too I really didn't mind since I wanted him to feel the same joy I did i let him see them. We showed up to the school and I got off without asking for them back shortly after this happened I realized what happen and me and my friend texted him, he told us that he would give it to the bus driver and he did he even took a video so that I could relax in class and not worry about it all day. When we got on the bus the driver told me that he never went up to her and that she never got them we showed her the video and she told us to sit down, before we could even get the cops to investigate it the school called my friend in for recording a fight and when they seen the video of our bus driver they made him delete it which meant we had no choice but to not get them to investigate since we no longer had any evidence. This had me depressed for months but almost a year later I decided to try one more time to get them i spent over 600 dollars to get them and the post office website told me that my package was delivered so I went down to check but it wasn't there so I just thought there was a mistake and waited for longer. Over a week had past bringing us to 4 days ago when this happened. I went down to the mailbox to get the mail and I seen a baggie in the mail I took it out to see my glasses destroyed they looked like they were hit with a bat with a note inside which said ""these are the most stupid sunglasses ever all they do is make everything red""  i knew what they meant cause all my friends had told me this happened when they put them on too we found out it just makes everything red if you aren't colourblind.  I was and still am devastated I just want to know why anyone would do this. I'm posting this today which is my birthday I looked outside about an hour ago and I seen a rainbow which was only yellow and blue like every other time I see them and it reminded me of the dream I had since I never got to see one the ways my friends and family do. To me all I can think about is that if these people weren't such rude people and left my package only I would have gotten to see my first rainbow the way everyone else does on my birthday none the less. I have decided that this is fates way of showing me that it wasn't meant to be so I can't bare to but another pair after all the trouble and heartache from the times before. I just wanted to post this so that people could know just how bad some people out there are and if you have read this far thankyou for your time and I hope you have a better day then me",1588198120.0,depression

**Prologue:** How this began:

>I woke up and got ready for work like any other normal quarantined morning/afternoon. I woke up, went to the restroom and opened my news up. I knew about the Kenosha shooting before I woke up but not much, just a few memes or whatever. I then started being a paranoid freak and thought that Kyle was a secret Chinese agent sent to attack specific people in a crowd because I only skimmed over the scraps of videos I found. However, as I read the comments of videos, posts, twitter feeds I was able to snag, the comments were disgusting and nasty. Some were just worshiping this Kyle fellow. As I got ready, I started digging into this and well, here we are. This is the result of my work today alone starting at 12:00pm and ending at 7:30 am.... the next day.  
  
>  
>Before we start, here is a general idea of comments are like on Reddit and various sites I have encountered.   
Pro-Kyle:   
""Man is a dedicated hero, he deserves to have a non tear-downable statue made of gold!""  
""He is a legend in the eyes of those who live in the riots! He is a true Chad, LET HIM FREE!""  
“What an absolute mad man, let him GO! AMAZING!”  
>  
>  
Anti-Kyle:  
""White supremacist teen fires on three protesters without cause, what a villain!”  
""This man was away from his home, he had no right to defend himself at all! JAIL! JAIL JAIL!""  
“This dude is a murdering fuck, I hope he rots in prison knowing he murdered three good people for NO REASON!”

>Both of these thoughts and ideas are just terrible, if you think either one of these, you are a bad person with incorrect morals and ideals who jumps to conclusions for gathering all of the facts. You, are the problem. This post is not to target individuals but entire groups but not to any one side. I am not saying you can't think for yourself or give your thoughts on a subject however if you don't get all the facts. YOU ARE AWFUL. I won't feed hypothetical garbage at you and confuse you, below you will find raw facts that I am able to provide. Do what you wish with these. Below everything is also my thoughts on the situation, opinions, notes and etc. Enjoy.

**Chapter I:** Unbiased Analysis of Video Recordings of Kyle before the Shooting(All three videos I’ve found)

>Here is my, an unbiased(as I can make it), objective and noted summary of what has been recorded and the videos I was able to find about Kyle, a 17 year old young adult,  why he was even in Kenosha in his own words. There have also been pictures of him scrubbing spray paint off of walls. These are just my summaries of his statements without making assumptions or submitting my opinion. I do not speculate where he is supposed to be there or not because there is no proof, the proof is in the videos. Watch and follow along if you wish. I did leave out details that I couldn't explain and did not pertain to the issues. 

&#x200B;

* In the first video, Kyle states he is there to help, to defend a specific business and he also states that part of his job is to help other people. He goes further and explains that he is armed because he feels he is going into harms way and needs his rifle to defend himself. He shows off his medkit and his rifle in said video. The video cuts off shortly after brandishing both items, the medkit and the rifle. The rifle appears to be an AR-15.
* Continuing, Kyle is seen in another video stating that he was 'protecting from the citizens' Kyle also informs the camera person that he was pepper sprayed by someone in the crowd. The camera person assumes that Kyle and his companions are using non-lethal, Kyle corrects him without being prompted that he does not have non-lethal ammo and that he is using lethal ammunition. Kyle then asks the camera person(s) to step back and proceeds to call the medics/EMT over to him, the video cuts off here.  Video cuts off there.
* A third video featuring Kyle shows the camera originally on a different armed person who will be called A in this part. The Camera person starts off by asking if it was a good angle before asking if the two armed men, if they were both local and both men A and Kyle answered yes nearly at the same time. Kyle introduces himself and soon mentions the Corona virus to the camera person who seems to be fine with being close to Kyle. The Camera man states he has a shirt that says he survived the Coronavirus. Soon a person in the background mentions ‘taking that restaurant’ then the camera person responds with ‘yeah.’  The camera pans down the street but the quality is too low to see what is going on. Kyle then says something partially incoherent about something ‘being dangerous’ and the camera person states they have been ‘doing this for about 12 years.’ Kyle is astonished and asks the camera person their age, the camera person responds with 41, Kyle is still shocked about this statement. The Camera person continues to telling both A and Kyle that if they see him get hit and knocked out, thats when he needs help, or if it looks like someone is going to beat him with a club, other than that, he doesn’t finish his statement. He says ‘non-aggression principle you know?’ And that he doesn’t want anyone hurt.   


>Based off of the three videos, his intentions and actions are stated consistently throughout all the videos found, he is there to help people, he is willing and able to defend himself and that he knows he is in harms way. In these videos, he is not seen shooting, firing or making any threats to anyone. He has not killed or harmed anyone within these videos. We are not bringing up what has happened between. The videos contains FACTS and thats the point here. 

&#x200B;

**Chapter II:** Unbiased Analysis of Video Recording of Shooting(1st minute only)

>I know that I have not covered the entire video, I do not see the point in wasting my time if no one will listen. If I get any attention to this post that is worthy, I will of course keep going. I may even do this regularly. Until then, you must enjoy this analysis of the first 60 seconds of the video(Source 5) in the description. The link was posted by a throwaway account on a post that was on the front page, thank you stranger. I again, left out any details that do not pertain to anything related to what happened except for a few minor things which may be important. I don't get paid for this stuff. Remember, this is just a summary of what happens in the video without my thoughts, just a transcript but without professionalism or proper formatting.   
  
>  
>There are two perspectives in this video, X and Y. Please be careful when reading this part and watch the video so it makes more sense. This summary is in order of the video not of events. The video splices together all together about 4 different perspectives but in the first minute there are only 2 camera people. They will be labeled when it changes. I don't have super crazy editing software or anything, I just lowered the DPI on my mouse and dragged over every frame for several hours.   
  
>  
>  
>  
>Perspective X: The video starts out with a view of the dealership lot, Kyle has not been sighted so far. The camera person explains that the man he previously spoke to said that his phone was slapped out of his hand and got socked(punched) at the same time. In the background it sounds like loud banging, steady constant beat. The Camera person continues to talk about the man getting his phone slapped. The Camera person then zooms into the distance and then back out again before panning to the dealer ship. During the pan, the view of two people running is clearly seen. The camera person explains then that the orders being shouted about ‘no cameras’ were from ‘white boys’ At 28 seconds, Kyle is seen running into the screen towards the building of the dealership, he is clearly carrying something resembling his AR-15 in his hands, no shots have been fired during this video relating to the incident. Soon after Kyle, another man who is masked is seen running the same direction as Kyle, a few seconds later the masked man is seen holding a bag(31 seconds). The Camera person states that someone is Antifa. The bag is clear in future frames but is not limp nor does it appear to containing, it may some sort of liquid or clear items inside allowing it to keep it’s bloated shaped. Backing up a few frames, the other man running behind Kyle is now lifting the bag over the back of his shoulder. The bag is now thrown from the masked man(red masked man) and hits the ground just behind Kyle. It appears to have popped or burst after being thrown. After the bag is thrown and hits the ground(33 seconds) Kyle appears to turn around and point his rifle towards the man who throw the bag at him. The masked man does notice the gun is pointing at him from how he backs up with his arms out, no gunshots have been fired from Kyle or anyone related to this incident. Kyle turns away and the masked man continues to follow Kyle before The Camera person sees the gun at this point and states it clearly. After Kyle goes behind the vehicle, the masked man continues to pursue after Kyle, a gunshot(F)(35 seconds) is fired but at this time during the video, the shooter is not clearly seen in this part of the footage.  The Camera person reacts to the shot. A man in the background shouts ‘fuck you’ which comes from the street. Kyle remakes his appearance from behind the car however the footage is very low quality and a lot is hard to make out. It is clear the masked man from before is still pursuing Kyle between two cars, 4 Gunshots(G, H, I, J)(38 seconds) are heard before both vanish from sight. Two more shots(K and L)(40 Seconds) are fired, then another shot is fired (M)(41\~ Seconds) as the camera person to the side says that ‘he’ shot ‘him’ before more shots are heard again. The camera person moves towards a wall with bushes, as a man in the distance calls out ‘yo what the fuck?’  
>  
>  
>  
>Perspective Y: At 44 seconds this perspective begins in the, A camera person in the lot or on the edge is filming about 10 yards away to the right from Perspective X. It starts at the part where Kyle vanishes from view behind the small group of vehicles and the first shots. The masked man is still following Kyle as Kyle has his back turned  and is not aiming. The first shot(F)(45\~ Seconds) is recorded in about 1 second into perspective Y(35 seconds into the video covering X). A man wearing black with white letters is seen to the right who is holding something in his hand that is dark and thin. Running between the two vehicles ,Kyle(start of 47\~ seconds) turns and raises his rifle, the pixels darken indicating he raised something, 4 gunshots(G, H, I, J)(38 Seconds in X, 47 in Y) are recorded. The masked man appears to fall to the ground, the footage partially corrupts around where the masked man fell, Kyle(start of 49) is seen moving around the vehicle. 2 gunshots(K and L)(40 seconds into X, 50 seconds into Y) are recorded, 1 gunshot(M)(41\~ seconds into X, 51 seconds into Y) are recorded. Kyle makes an appearance from behind the vehicle and begins to approach the body. Around 58 seconds, Kyle has his rifle lowered and moves towards the body and appears to examine the masked man’s body. End of the first minute.

>This is just 1 minute out of 7 minutes and 40 seconds of a video clip I found on the internet. As well as the two other sources below. Already a lot has happened. It will take me another 8 or so hours to go through the rest of the video carefully looking at every bit of detail. 

  
**Conclusion:** My Opinions Released and Other Things

>This is only the first minute of the video I examined, two different perspectives which tell very similar stories. You may go through the videos as you please, scanning the video in Generic Windows or Apple video software, look at the details. It is now about 7:30am when I am typing and going over this one last time, I am exhausted. I have changed that time six times so far. Do me a favor, educate yourself before you go online and talk about something you barely understand. My post is not perfect in any way however it’s here to make the point that anyone can take the time to go over all of the information and study what is going on. Make time if you can't, This is important, the life of a 17 year old is at stake. Whether he is guilty or not is not for anyone on Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, the coffee shop or even my mom can decide but you can make sure you are told the truth.

&#x200B;

*So DirtyRanger34, what are your thoughts on what happened, what is your biased opinion now that you’ve picked through all the information?*

>I think Kyle should’ve stayed home, watched the news and maybe did something in his hometown where he lived instead of in another state. I do find his attitude and discipline with his rifle admirable, he was calm and collected the entire time even when his life was threatened. With unexplained gunshots, I think he may have panicked after they went behind the first car in X, the first gunshot. He continued until the masked guy was on top of him before firing 4 rounds(G, H, I and J) at the red masked man. Kyle was not a mass shooter or white supremacist, terrorist. 3 people got shot after attacking him, if you think that makes you a terrorist, I guess I need to tell our veterans something they're not going to like.

>  
>  
>When he looked at the body, he told someone on the phone that he killed someone, the person most likely told him to turn himself in. Which is why he started back towards where he knew police were? Do you think if he wanted to run, he would've I dunno... RAN AWAY? Some of you people are just.... wow. you act like he ran around and shot 3 random people for no reason? They attacked him.

Bad Ideals/Ethics:

>Next time anyone who says it wasn't self defense because he wasn't at home, can no longer defend themselves from muggers, kidnappers and attacks if they are not in their homes. You must now accept your fate and be killed, kidnapped or robbed from now on. This isn't what I actually think, its what people like YOU think. Not all of you, but a lot of you.   
  
>  
>Bad Ideals/Ethics again:   
Kyle was defending his neighbors from attackers, doing what is his given right to bear arms and defend against those who wish to harm this country. He shot them, it doesn't matter why, they were all bad right? This isn't what I actually think, its what people like YOU think. Not all of you, but a lot of you.

>I know there are people like me, who actually go through information. Good on you, but speak up. Let your voices be heard! Don't let these two sides bully you, you are you. Stand for what is right.

>My opinions did not reflect in my summary, I tried to remain as unbiased as I can while describing exactly what happens in the video second by second/frame by frame, stating only what I can prove using the video and the facts. I only explain what is going on, not what I think is going on. My summary has affected my opinion however and I firmly believe without a doubt that Kyle defended himself against several attackers who wanted to harm him and take his rifle. Kyle was nearly soaked in something in a plastic bag, nearly stomped on by at least two people, nearly pinned and restrained by a group of people who wanted to hurt him and finally a guy with a gun aiming it at him after he faked surrendering. I feel this is justified self defense but, whether he should've been there in the first place? No, he should've been home studying.   
  
>  
>This part is a little all over, I am sorry ahead of time for this. Some people also on Reddit say that, they were surprised that his photo in a cadet uniform and are saying he would make a great cop. If he didn't pull this stunt, I think he would've made a good cop. He showed, restraint, courage, determination and knew if he messed up. Isn't that what you want? Cops to show restraint under duress while still being courageous enough to help people with confidence and if they mess up or do something bad, they admit it?

>That is what Kyle did, whether he was right or wrong.

>The only thing I know, is that most of you... are awful, wrong and should rethink your views now. 

*What are your thoughts on each of the three people who got shot by Kyle?*

* Red masked Guy: Idiot, chased after a man with a gun. You got shot, good work, what did that accomplish? Idiot.
* Skater Guy: Probably wanted to do some honest good, it didn’t look like he tried to hit Kyle, only hold him down. It’s a shame he died. 
* Guy who got his bicep blown off: FUCKING TRASH. You faked your surrender only to pull a gun on a man, not only are you trash but you played like trash. I personally hope he gets slapped with harsher charges.

**Notes and Miscellaneous:**

* I will try to answer questions however any questions that show a sense of ignorance, hate or malice will be ignored to the best of my abilities. 
* I am not a debater, I havedebate skills but I won't argue my point, this post should do that for me. 
* I am a 22 year old man who works an 8 and a half hour shift 5-6 days a week 365 days a year in customer service. I am not a Journalist, YouTuber or Influencer. I don't even have a Facebook account, Twitter, A Youtuber blog, Instagram or OnlyFans. Not yet anyways.
* I have depression. This world, makes my depression flare up. Correction, people make my depression flare up.  


**A few notable mentions:** You know who you are, not talking about everyone.

* Subreddit Mods/Owners: Allowing these relentless mobs to make these disgusting comments and partake in these discussions to play judge, jury and executioner Ones who also silence those who post differing opinions. Enforcing your will to silence others is not much different than a tyrannic government silencing you. Awful,
* Redditors: Jumping to conclusions and making nasty comments about a person they barely know, praising a person they barely know and not understanding a situation in full detail. You spread lies and false truths and expect everything to be done YOUR way or no way.  Awful.
* Twitter People: Spewing their useless thoughts making an entire situation worse most likely because they haven’t gone through the information carefully. You are cringe, truly, you think that followers matter on social media? Grow up. Awful.
* Journalists and News: Taking sides in a discussion they have no right to and carving the nation into what they want. Report the news, you’re not here to have an opinion your business is facts. Do not put race into anything.  Awful. 
* Readers to this post: You already making a decision whether Kyle deserves to be arrested or imprisoned or praised. After reading this post, you should change your mind and mind your business.  Awful.
* Me: I spent all my free time, time off at work, my breaks and lunch at work, my sleeping time to make this post because I stuck my own nose in it I should’ve been playing Tarkov. Awful.

this is my first time using reddit. but im just a person who just has great ideas but no one to listen. im that person at school who got popular after moving in 2 weeks just of the beginning of school. but just being popular for making music, djing, and having many skills that many dont just to have at a young age. but it is what they say. i noticed that there is perks being popular at school as well being not that popular. there's pros and cons but being popular is fun and cool all but really it is a sad reality as well. everyone thinks that your so popular you have many friends and have everything but thats what it looks likes on the outside. they ask and see ""how are you so happy all the time!?"" i just say i just am for some reason. just to make them feel to have more confidence. im that person at school that would make sure everyone is okay and good. i realized that i've been putting everyone in front of me instead of putting me first but i just can't for some reason. but i also realized that everyone do love me. but nobody likes me. what i mean in a way is that nobody likes me in a loving way. but everyone loves me because the things i do. 

&#x200B;

i realized the so called ""friends"" aren't really friends. because everyone who i talk to is not even wanting to talk with me because there not even engaging into the convo. and now im not sure who to even call my friends because that sad truth is that. and basically i feel like over the last few months I've kind of lost interest and faith in my friends. where I once really admired my best friends, i tried to be more like them and to impress them whenever we hung out. now it feels like we've grown apart, i mean we all get along really well and we're all still very close, but it seems like no-one really puts in much effort with one another any more. No one works much, so it's not just a matter of free time. but does anyone else find themselves watching their friends slip away, and what did you do about it, if anything? i know there's a debate between being an introvert or just general socially anxious, but I honestly thought this would be the best place to put this. but i don't have any problems like that. im a extrovert when it becomes to being in the public.

and not to put anyone above me or below me. but being in the 6 months that ive been to school ive done already so much for the school and me signing up for ASB and then they don't even want me to help which was surprising to me. but then someone told me, the reason why they didn't want me in because the ASB group did not like the things i was doing at school for the good. so they decided to not let me join. and then they said it was because that it was being a different national person and a color person and they said if you look at the asb there all white majority and they didn’t want or to see a colored person being a leader as well. 

and i thought that could be true but i would never know that it is true. I’m not saying that that is the reasoning but it could of been the reasoning of why. i just kinda decided to disconnected with everyone on social media. so i was gone for a few months and i wasn't that surprised that no one didn't even know or care that i was active and that really made feel that i am no ones friends and don’t have any friends. and then it made me feel no wonder I’m a out cast and feel always so alone and never invited to hangout or anything. 

but all in the end, pretending that everything is okay. kinda always work. so for a long time i would always pretend being to happy and good at school and in front of everyone. 

if you have anything to help me or thoughts it would be much appreciated. i'm just kinda lost.

thank you for actually reading this

152,2006.0,Brother no showed his own wedding.,7797,15jiazp,awfuleverything,https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/15jiazp/brother_no_showed_his_own_wedding/,480,"So my brother (38) has always been an arsehole but this is next level even for him.
He's a drinker that has had long stretches of sobriety before falling off the wagon pretty hard. He's been drinking again recently but during his stag doo a couple of weeks back he was completely well behaved. He was drinking most of the day was was perfectly pleasant and responsible to everybody and went to bed with no issues.

Now on top of all that he's never been completely trustworthy. Always doing the minimum amount of work he can to get by and often hooks up with the kind of women that are lonely and willing to do everything for him. For the last several years he's been with a very kind lady who still fits that description. This girl can do it all, painting, decorating, plumbing, fixing cars, anything she sets her mind too. Absolutely the opposite of my brother.

She asked him to get married and after he said yes she went to work, putting months of time and effort into planning and buying everything to make it perfect including his own suit, shoes ect and she was working overtime to make this happen.

The night before the wedding she was up late decorating the venue whilst he was at the pub having a few beers with the father of the bride and his best man. Around 12am those guys decided enough was enough and it was time for bed. My brother wanted to head into town and the guys were telling him not to be so stupid and escorted him to his hotel room.

Cut to around 8am the next morning. My sister is doing the bride's hair and make-up, my mother and auntie are dressing up the young bridesmaids and everybody there is as happy as you could imagine.
Meanwhile the father of the bride and the best man are unable to contact my brother and after gaining access to his room realise he's not there and the bed was clearly not slept in.

They start frantically trying to call and go out looking (service is at 12:30pm)
He finally answers at around 10:30 telling the best man to calm down he's coming back soon (there's music and laughter in the background and he's clearly at some kind of party) he then hangs up and turns his phone off.

An hour later there's still no sign and the guys make the decision to head to the ladies hotel next door and tell them what's happened.
I'm sure you can imagine the scene as such a happy morning turns to one of complete devastation. With the father and mother of the bride bawling into each others arms, the bride hysterical, being consoled by my sister and bridesmaids, my mother, auntie and the best man watching all of this and feeling heartbroken and also complete embarrassment.

It got to 12:15 with the bride holding out hope for those final few seconds before realising it was over and they had to cancel and that was that.
The next time my brother was seen was randomly by a wedding reception guest that turned up at the wrong hotel about 3:30pm.
He was drinking in a bar over the road on his own and when asked what the hell he was doing just played it off with ""Meh, what's all the fuss about. No big deal. We can do it anytime"" ect.

The guest left him to it and we all met at the reception. The bride had decided to go ahead as a thank you to those who'd made the effort to travel to be there, take days off ect but I'm sure you can imagine how it all went down with people randomly breaking into tears or getting angry throughout the night.

Now it's the next morning and the bride and her family travel home. My brother's outside the house complaining about being cold and to be let in.
However when he sees the faces of the bride, her father and her brothers, he swiftly turns on the waterworks and starts apologising to them all and how he didn't mean it. He basically got chased out of the street.

His bags were packed and thrown out on too the lawn.

His designer clothes and shoes that she has paid for over the years were sold on Facebook marketplace that afternoon.

He has no phone as he lost it at some point.

His bank account is empty as he spent everything on that one drinking session.

And he has nowhere to go. None of us would take him in and my mother is going to stay with her for a few weeks to take care of everything.

That's the story and now we're living with the aftermath. The news is all over Facebook and everyone is feeling heartbroken and humiliated.
My mother has always been a wonderful, kind hearted lady but has never been able to have a happy life.
Since she left my abusive father and his suicide she's been dealing with my brother's issues ever since.
I think she thought she'd finally got him over the finish line with this wedding and now that hope has turned to dust.

My thoughts are with her and his lovely would-be wife but I have a deep level of anxiety and dread over what happens now with my brother. He doesn't deserve to be allowed back into her life and obviously her family utterly despise him at this point along with most of my family, his friends and best man.

I hear a neighbour has put him up in a hotel outside of town for a few days (always a bleeding heart for him to turn to) to clear his head. However with no family, phone, home (it's in her name) car (it's in her name) or money I just can't see where he goes from here.

At almost 40 the days of him using his boyish good looks and charm to worm his way back in or elsewhere are pretty much done and the big fear is he goes down the same path his dad did.

The bride, my mother, sister and now possibly her mother (in his place) along with the kids. Are about to fly out on the honeymoon for ten days which I couldn't be happier about. That will really help them.

My brother however is now on his own, penniless, alone with his thoughts until he has to check out on Monday morning.

I have an overwhelming sense of anxiety and despair.

**The Killer Mother**

1

I gave birth to thirteen children

To my great despair that girls

I killed twelve

I did not overcome the thirteenth

I did not overcome the thirteenth

And it's not for lack of trying.

2

The other night as I slept soundly

I was awakened by a terrible evil

A fiery red crow, emaciated

Pushing his beak into my ear

Another white as foam

Scratching and hurting my breast

The next day at dawn

I was pregnant

I was pregnant

And gave birth in the afternoon

From a little girl the thirteenth

Me who wanted so much a boy

From a little girl with red hair

Like his mother's

From a little girl with charcoal black eyes

It wasn't his mother's eyes

I didn't know who the father was

""Sleep, sleep wisely beautiful angel

And I'll cuddle you

And I will dig you a small pit

In the garden under the fir tree

And I'll sing you a song

""The Gwerz of death, the song of the deceased!""

I hadn't finished those words

That I gave him poisoned milk

I gave him poisoned milk

She asked for more

I then took a comforter

And suffocated him mercilessly

But soon after

She was codling again

She dressed in her cradle

I then grabbed a knife

And the strike full of fury

In the chest, in the heart

I hit her with all my might.

Without the slightest drop of blood flowing!

I hit her blow after blow

I hit her like crazy

I hit her, hit her so hard

Exhausted, I faint

The next morning I was awake

By the little voice of my damned daughter

She seemed to be telling me

""How well I slept!""

3

Here it is become great

For my greatest misfortune

Morning and evening, day and night

It makes my life hell

She plays dirty tricks on me

One day she will kill me

""My mother, please

Give me your pickaxe

Or your shovel no matter what

That I dig a hole in the garden

That I dig a hole in the garden

To plant a new tree

Instead of the dead fir tree

My mother, please! »

And I poor idiot, I bend

Soon after, she told me again

""My mother, I'm done digging

Come and see! »

But once at the edge of the pit

She pushed me inside

And buried me.

4

Me voici enfouie sous terre

Pétrifiée de terreur

Je gratte, je me débats

Hélas, hélas ! en vain

Hélas, hélas ! je n’arrive à rien

Qu’à m’enfoncer plus encore

Je crie de tout mon être

Mais personne ne m’entend

J’appelle à tue-tête

Mais personne ne me répond 

Dans ma tombe froide

Que le bruit des vers visqueux

Qui glissent entre mes doigts !

5

But what is this clamor?

Tell me, in the name of God!

But what is this din

Who makes the earth tremble?

I see a crowd coming to me

In the lead the Ankou, what a horror!

He rides a blind horse

On each side lightning bursts

On each side gushs smoke

Behind him go children

Aborted children

Emaciated body and faces

Behind him go twelve girls

O my soul, these are mine!

They make a round around me

And start dancing and singing

And they turn again and again

Faster and faster with each turn

""Sweet mother, sleep wisely

And we will sing you a song

We will sing you a beautiful song

""The Gwerz of pain, the song of hell!""

I’m broken and I feel like there’s no repair. I carry the weight of the world on my own. I have no family I can count on. After years of emotional, physical and mental abuse I cracked at 31 years old. My oldest memory of abuse is 4 yo. I wanted to end it, never feel empty and discarded ever again.

I didn’t have much of an identity before but I was functional. I could get hurt by someone and walk away unphased and onto the next thing. Then I met my ex husband. Gave everything I had to him just for him to cheat the entire time we were together. Encouraged him towards a very lucrative career and took a back breaking job and took care of our kids our youngest being special needs. I supported him, I took his courses for him, even wrote his entrance essay for acceptance into a really prestigious school. 

All the while he was Screwing people left and right as I was being depleted of any human trace I had left. Working 16 hour nights and putting another 8 to ensure our children were taken care of. Blamed me for his cheating narcissistic ways. I worked too much and never looked at him. He hated me because he had to do the dishes. Had to watch our kids because I couldn’t walk after working 4 16 hour shifts back to back that even turning in bed caused me so much pain. 

“You never look at me.” I’m sorry, I was falling into a deep depression and I couldn’t get out. I begged him for help but was rebuffed and made to feel like it was all in my head. The only gift I wanted was to be left alone for my birthday, but that was me being selfish he said. 

I left when he slapped me the one and only time he’d ever done that. That was my final straw. 5 months after our separation, a fb message was sent to me on thanksgiving. “He was having an affair with me and I found out he cheated on me with another girl during his summer internship.” 

The pictures that came with it, no wife should ever see. Any semblance of sanity I had, broke. That summer, was unbearable. I couldn’t do it anymore... I lost control and FaceTimed him... hysterically yelling and crying. Says it’s a lie, even with picture proof. 

I went silent for 2 days and I cried for my father. The only time I had ever done that... I’d drive to work looking at anything sturdy to crash into. Kept thinking how easy it would be to just STOP feeling. Stop thinking, stop being hurt. I was alone sitting on my bed, contemplating taking pills. Leaving a note on my front door to call 911 and not let me children in.

My kids popping in and out of my mind. I can’t leave them. They need me. They’d hate me if I left them. 

I checked myself into a mental hospital... I needed to reset. Bring myself back but I can’t. My ex husband thinks I’m fine, my kids love me and I love them.

Long story short when I was fifteen I befriended this beautiful girl on Facebook. We talked daily for over a year. I felt like we were sisters. To break it down.

1. Said she referred me to her modeling company and if I got the job not only would I have monies, but we’d finally meet.
2. Time for the audition! On Skype, obviously no red flags here right? I strike some poses, I’m feeling cute. But now the company wants me to get naked. Hold up! I hang up.
3. My “bestie sister” immediately messages me like girl what is you doing, if you’re going to be a model you’re going to have to get used to being naked. It’s just a body. We’re all women no biggie. So what does my smart teenage brain do? I join! And I strip.
4. While naked I’m told to do various poses, when they tell me to move like I’m making love to the wind I’m just like f this, models are weird and I want no parts. Disconnect. Bestie sis messages me again but I’m like nope idc what you have to say I’m not doing it.

Y’all, this bitch snaps. Not only does she snap, like 10+ accounts starts messaging and threatening me at the SAME TIME. Like the same exact second. I’m freaked out of my mind. They threaten me that they have my address, my nudes, that they’ll send them to everyone unless I get back on Skype.

I get back on Skype with the video off ugly crying, begging. They’re like shut up bitch (lmao ☠️) but I’m like fuck this, send what y’all have I’m not giving anything else!

I live in tense fear for months. I don’t tell anyone. My anxiety is born.

163,2262.0,Brother no showed his own wedding.,7798,15jiazp,awfuleverything,https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/15jiazp/brother_no_showed_his_own_wedding/,480,"So my brother (38) has always been an arsehole but this is next level even for him.
He's a drinker that has had long stretches of sobriety before falling off the wagon pretty hard. He's been drinking again recently but during his stag doo a couple of weeks back he was completely well behaved. He was drinking most of the day was was perfectly pleasant and responsible to everybody and went to bed with no issues.

Now on top of all that he's never been completely trustworthy. Always doing the minimum amount of work he can to get by and often hooks up with the kind of women that are lonely and willing to do everything for him. For the last several years he's been with a very kind lady who still fits that description. This girl can do it all, painting, decorating, plumbing, fixing cars, anything she sets her mind too. Absolutely the opposite of my brother.

She asked him to get married and after he said yes she went to work, putting months of time and effort into planning and buying everything to make it perfect including his own suit, shoes ect and she was working overtime to make this happen.

The night before the wedding she was up late decorating the venue whilst he was at the pub having a few beers with the father of the bride and his best man. Around 12am those guys decided enough was enough and it was time for bed. My brother wanted to head into town and the guys were telling him not to be so stupid and escorted him to his hotel room.

Cut to around 8am the next morning. My sister is doing the bride's hair and make-up, my mother and auntie are dressing up the young bridesmaids and everybody there is as happy as you could imagine.
Meanwhile the father of the bride and the best man are unable to contact my brother and after gaining access to his room realise he's not there and the bed was clearly not slept in.

They start frantically trying to call and go out looking (service is at 12:30pm)
He finally answers at around 10:30 telling the best man to calm down he's coming back soon (there's music and laughter in the background and he's clearly at some kind of party) he then hangs up and turns his phone off.

An hour later there's still no sign and the guys make the decision to head to the ladies hotel next door and tell them what's happened.
I'm sure you can imagine the scene as such a happy morning turns to one of complete devastation. With the father and mother of the bride bawling into each others arms, the bride hysterical, being consoled by my sister and bridesmaids, my mother, auntie and the best man watching all of this and feeling heartbroken and also complete embarrassment.

It got to 12:15 with the bride holding out hope for those final few seconds before realising it was over and they had to cancel and that was that.
The next time my brother was seen was randomly by a wedding reception guest that turned up at the wrong hotel about 3:30pm.
He was drinking in a bar over the road on his own and when asked what the hell he was doing just played it off with ""Meh, what's all the fuss about. No big deal. We can do it anytime"" ect.

The guest left him to it and we all met at the reception. The bride had decided to go ahead as a thank you to those who'd made the effort to travel to be there, take days off ect but I'm sure you can imagine how it all went down with people randomly breaking into tears or getting angry throughout the night.

Now it's the next morning and the bride and her family travel home. My brother's outside the house complaining about being cold and to be let in.
However when he sees the faces of the bride, her father and her brothers, he swiftly turns on the waterworks and starts apologising to them all and how he didn't mean it. He basically got chased out of the street.

His bags were packed and thrown out on too the lawn.

His designer clothes and shoes that she has paid for over the years were sold on Facebook marketplace that afternoon.

He has no phone as he lost it at some point.

His bank account is empty as he spent everything on that one drinking session.

And he has nowhere to go. None of us would take him in and my mother is going to stay with her for a few weeks to take care of everything.

That's the story and now we're living with the aftermath. The news is all over Facebook and everyone is feeling heartbroken and humiliated.
My mother has always been a wonderful, kind hearted lady but has never been able to have a happy life.
Since she left my abusive father and his suicide she's been dealing with my brother's issues ever since.
I think she thought she'd finally got him over the finish line with this wedding and now that hope has turned to dust.

My thoughts are with her and his lovely would-be wife but I have a deep level of anxiety and dread over what happens now with my brother. He doesn't deserve to be allowed back into her life and obviously her family utterly despise him at this point along with most of my family, his friends and best man.

I hear a neighbour has put him up in a hotel outside of town for a few days (always a bleeding heart for him to turn to) to clear his head. However with no family, phone, home (it's in her name) car (it's in her name) or money I just can't see where he goes from here.

At almost 40 the days of him using his boyish good looks and charm to worm his way back in or elsewhere are pretty much done and the big fear is he goes down the same path his dad did.

The bride, my mother, sister and now possibly her mother (in his place) along with the kids. Are about to fly out on the honeymoon for ten days which I couldn't be happier about. That will really help them.

My brother however is now on his own, penniless, alone with his thoughts until he has to check out on Monday morning.

I have an overwhelming sense of anxiety and despair.

I have known good cops and bad cops. I am not advocating that all police are bad. It is my hope that this exposé would encourage and advocate for the mental health that police officers are so desperately in need of.*** 

The pit in my stomach seemed to have been caused by a vacuuming effect directly related to the hard, hateful look in his cold blue eyes. He hated me. In that moment and in so many others, he hated me. I think I was about ten when I realized there was something truly, disturbingly wrong with my father. He seemed to only find satisfaction in exerting power and control, but also wanted to be seen as a man of knowledge and concern for the world and the people in it. His eyes were boring a hole into me. He had just gotten in my face, his cigarette breath and saliva spewing at me because I had made the mistake of answering his question wrong. Or maybe the tone of my voice wasn’t respectful enough. Who knows? I would worry about that later. Right now my mind was concerned about where my siblings were and if they were tucked away in their rooms so they wouldn’t have to see this. 

I had been walking through the kitchen to get breakfast. He was in a bad mood. The empty diet soda he had in his hand was my first signal. Crap.  Some people shouldn’t ingest certain chemicals. Whatever was wrong with his brain was heightened when he drank aspartame. He told me to grab him another one. Maybe I sighed and didn’t realize it. If I had a dime for every time my siblings and I had to get him coffee, soda, or the cigarettes he had left somewhere, I could have started all our college funds. He was looking for a fight. From his recliner in the living room he watched the news, sighing his sharp, exasperated anger that made me shiver. Maybe something on TV triggered him. I didn’t really care, I just knew it was going to be bad when he asked if I had done the dishes yet. It was a Saturday morning. I had waited as long as I could to get breakfast, hoping he would fall asleep in the recliner so I could quietly do the dishes and grab toaster tarts to take back to my room. But the dishes weren’t done yet, and, “I came to do them now,” was not the answer he wanted to hear. He stood up. His short build, the epitome of Napoleon's Syndrome. But still, he was taller than me. 

There would be no crescendo of anger because his anger didn’t grow. It just happened. From 0 to 160 in the blink of an eye. No warning. Just, this is happening. A litany of questions and accusations were fired my way that my brain couldn’t process, so I didn’t answer. For over an hour all his focus was put on belittling me, my laziness, my lack of importance, and how hard he worked to give us nice things. Phrases like, “How are you going to be successful at life if you can’t even do the simple chores we give you?” “I work my ass off to give you kids a nice house and you don’t even take care of it.” “You’re lay-zy.” “You think you’re going to accomplish anything by being a fat ass that sits around the house all day?” “Oh that’s right… you’re going to be a psychologist. They sit on their asses all the time. That’s convenient for you.” Always more questions. Always belittling. Always in my face.  

His logic was illogical. His words were cruel. His tone of voice was maniacal. But it was the gaslighting and mind games he played that seemed to cause the most damage to my family of seven. I was the oldest and it was my job to keep the other kids out of his line of fire. But sometimes I couldn’t. Sometimes I didn’t have the courage to take blame for something I didn’t do. Sometimes I didn’t want to stand for so long that my feet left impressions in the carpet. So sometimes I didn’t take the blame, and for that, more than twenty years later, I will always feel shame and regret.

He was a part-time cop and nice guy. He was a full-time salesman and bully. He was a charismatic man, not overly attractive, but powerful in his words. He and my mother would sit around their dining room table with friends and strangers alike, making suggestions and offering counsel that those people would forever be grateful for. But those friends and strangers didn’t know. They had no idea the man so smooth and smart was a cruel and demeaning man behind closed doors. How could they? He wore a badge on the weekends. Helped out victims of abuse and car accidents. There was never any outward indication that the father who paid such close attention to my friends and their interests, who seemed to genuinely care about their career goals, would mock my dreams of social work and law school, reminding me how no jury would ever be convinced by an overweight attorney with acne scars. 

One of his favorite *games* was, “Let’s See if they’re Lying.” The irony of this game was none of us innocent bystanders knew that while he was interrogating our virginity, choice of friends, and schedules, he was a serial cheater on both our mother and our family for fifteen years. (A note to self that would have been helpful all those years ago: What they accuse you of, they are almost always guilty of.) The game was simple, the rules were hella hard. Sit down. Answer questions. For hours. The interrogation would be a repeat of the same questions. “Why are you lying?” “Where did you really go after church?” “Why are you crying?” “If you’d just be honest, this would all be over.” “Where were you?” “Why didn’t you answer your phone?” “Who were you with?” I often thought in my own head, ‘If he really wants the truth, why doesn’t he just track my mileage. Then he’d know.’ But that’s the thing, he didn’t want to know I was being truthful. He wanted mind games that were so crazy I would never be able to think my way out of them. It was like a labyrinth for the brain and there were no clues as to where the right turn might be.  And the topic of interrogation wasn’t just where we had been. That would have been easy to fix, just don’t go anywhere. No, the interrogations had huge variations. When things went missing from the house, like when he misplaced his keys or cell phone and surely one of us must have taken them, or the topic of career and college, music choices, or whether we had completed all our chores that day. 

Another of his favorites was a sick game I used to call, “Meal Time for the Anorexic,” because sitting around a meal as a “family” was so nauseating you would have to throw up afterwards. I never did understand how someone who had a taste for nicotine and tobacco could distinguish between a meal that tasted good and didn’t, but he was the family food critic, and had something to say about every. single. meal. He would ridicule and critique my mother’s cooking with every bite and expect us kids to always agree. And if we tried to protect my mother’s feelings because in reality, it was pretty damn good, we were viciously turned against. For a long time, I couldn’t watch cooking competitions. 

On top of the cruel food critiquing, there was an incident with my sister and a steak knife that left all of us scarred. She was six and didn’t know how to slice steak. He thought it would be a good idea to teach her. It escalated quickly when she was too intimidated by his cruelty and the sharpness of the knife, and the fear we all had, that he was going to stab her with it. Fifteen years later my sister still doesn’t know how to cut steak, and in fact has become a vegetarian. These were not one time incidents over our dinner table, these were consistent. These were our meals. This was our life.

After he decided we’d been through enough, that we were never going to give him the truth, or that we were never going to measure up, we were dismissed to our rooms. There were times I barely had the mental capacity to move my legs up the stairs. It felt like all the neurons in my brain had been stolen because nothing would fire. There was no thought left in my head. I remember laying in my bed so many times, trying to focus on basic addition and there was nothing there. There was no energy left to move. No emotion left to be mad. No capacity left to cry. No self-justification or defense I even wanted to come up with in my own head. I would just lay there, numb. Even now, all these years later, I can’t feel anything about what happened to me. My brain is in automatic apathy mode for the interrogations and events I lived through.

Oh, but I do have anger. The anger is for the sisters I watched get berated because I hadn’t stepped in in time. The anger that still courses through me every time I think of my sister’s pale, blood-drained faces as he screamed at them how lazy and stupid they were. I have anger toward myself for not taking blame when I could have. For not being the one to stand there in the bathroom when he found a used tampon that missed the trashcan and hadn’t been retrieved. It wasn’t mine, but I could have lied. I’m still angry at my mom for never doing something about it. Something real. Something that could have ended it. Her half-ass arguments to try and get him to stop the abuse did nothing. And we girls were just supposed to accept it. And when it was over, we were instructed to get over it. By her. Our mother. I’m angry that, after the particularly bad events, when my mother would suggest he get mental help, he refused. Citing, “That will  ruin my police career.” As if a career-a part time job, mind you- was more important than his family. As if a stigma-a false stigma- he fed into, was more important than his own well-being. I’m still angry that no one in the law enforcement realm, no superior or equal evaluated his mental state. And I worried every time he strapped that gun on his hip that he would lose his cool around a criminal the way he did around us kids. But my family is lucky. We are lucky that we don’t have to live knowing our family member was responsible for another case of police brutality or killed a citizen  in the line of duty. 

After being mentally and emotionally abused by him when I was young, and then physically assaulted by him later, I can honestly say I think I would have preferred scars and bruises to the things he did to my mind. The bullying, the weird mind games I didn’t have the right answers to. No way of telling when the yelling and berating would end. I guess he chose to end them when he felt he’d made his point of superior intellect known. And that’s the real difference between a physical abuser and a mental abuser. Physical abuse takes nothing but fists. You don’t have to be smart to hit someone. Or even bigger. But I often recall the look in his eyes when he was on a roll with me or one of my sisters. A gloating, cold satisfaction that with his brain, he had the power. Because how can your victim win a battle of wits when logic isn’t an equation? 

    How can a victim prove that you are destroying their spirit and emotionally abusing them when there are no scars? If I have no scars, they have no proof. And if you have a badge, I have no voice. There were countless times I wanted to call someone. But I knew at an early age how the boy’s club worked. I knew one cop would show up to another cop’s house and commiserate with him about “family life.” I wish I had a team of armed men that had my back. I wish my siblings had had that. I wish criminals who are laid in the prone position, handcuffs behind their backs, had that. 

    You hear abuse victims say all the time that they never did anything or told anyone because the authorities would never believe that their slick, charismatic abuser would be capable of hurting anyone. Now imagine that the abuser is also an authority figure. You’re basically screwed.

“There is a fine line between a cop and a criminal.” I used to believe this with all my heart. Because I’m convinced that what he did to us, the emotional, physical, and mental abuse, was criminal. But now, I know that the fine line between a cop and a criminal, grows as an officer receives proper mental health. Hurt people, hurt people. Being a police officer cannot be used as an excuse to avoid seeking help for mental health. Being a cop should be the reason for seeking help. 

I think most of us have a side of ourselves we try to hide from the outside world. This is a sad, but natural state for most people in the first world. But for some, those more mentally unhealthy, this “secret identity” is another thing entirely, and it is usually caused by unmanaged trauma. These people become the villain whose own secrets drive them to inflict hell on those beneath them. The blurred images of who they are part time and who they are most of the time become one mess, and they turn into people who can’t begin to hold normal relationships with anyone. 

And what happens to your morals and character when you can’t have positive relationships? Your view on humanity declines. Eventually people’s humanity is no longer precious. Life is no longer honored or respected, and it becomes easier for the mentally ill to treat themselves as superior and under no obligation to give people the dignity they deserve simply because they are alive. They understand the art of manipulation, and their mind games that leave the normal person sick and tortured are a form of abuse they take enjoyment in. Slap a badge on this person, hand them a gun, and call them “law enforcement,” and you have a recipe for disaster. 

This is exactly what happened to the man I no longer call father. He was a victim too once, abused in all manners of sick ways by people let into his life. His tumultuous childhood was a recipe for psychosis. And the lies he later told himself and his family added to his past traumas. As a police officer he saw and dealt with the dead bodies of innocent victims. Filed reports on victims of heinous crimes. Had to sit across from the families of abusers. He systematically piled trauma on top of trauma without ever dealing with any of it. That’s not an excuse. Mental health is only a defense when you actively sought help for it. But it is a reason. It’s a reason people are dying at the hands of those in authority. A big reason. I have a bachelors in criminology and I now work in social work, helping children deal with trauma. And I believe with every fiber of my being, that if he had gotten help for his mental problems, he wouldn’t have been so evil.

It’s taken me a very long time to dismiss the words and deeds he put on me and my sisters. But I no longer see myself as the burdensome, fat, good-for-nothing spawn he so often made me feel like. I understand his treatment of me was a reflection that his mental illness had put in front of him, protecting him from what he really thought of himself. And it would be so easy for me to agree with him. To say, “Yes, you ARE a burdensome, fat, good for nothing man who has never amounted to anything .” But that’s not my heart to him. My mother says I hate him and asks why I don’t love him. My reply, “I’ve learned that hate is not the opposite of love.  Indifference is the opposite of love."" Hate takes a level of caring that my forgiveness has freed me from. Hate is malicious, but it’s still a level of concern. My forgiveness of his actions has freed me of all concern for him. Positive or otherwise. I don’t wish ill upon him. I hope he can live his life and get the help he needs.

I wrote this in an attempt, not to show myself as the victim, or to demonize yet another cop, but to show the importance of supplying our police departments with much needed mental health trainings. I advocate for intense, regular, and mandatory mental health evaluations throughout the year. I advocate for the training of de-escalation techniques in all circumstances, even when the person needing to be de-escalated is the cop himself. I advocate for mandatory therapies for all first responders. What they do is hard, traumatic, and important. And people's lives are on the line.",1592188719.0,trauma

Maybe I came in with the wrong expectations back then, because I honestly didn't expect these guys to have the personality of a *brick.* I swear, I could just be rambling to myself in my room and I'd leave the conversation feeling better—with these guys they're literally just going ""Hmm"" and ""Yeah, I understand you"" and ""Your feelings are valid"" and ""DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE OR SELF HARM?"". The repetitiveness of these calls are enough to drive a person to suicide rather than stop them from it, I'm telling you, man.

I don't self-harm, I don't use substances, I don't have suicidal thoughts or thoughts about harming someone; I probably sound like the pinnacle of mental health to these guys for just wanting to have a conversation with someone on the phone instead of just mindlessly venting my problems into the speaker.

I am young yes but I never had a connection with a person or my family either. I just don’t care about others. How can I lack so much emotion for people yet I am the most sensitive person and dependent person, It makes no sense, everyone, my therapist say i contradict myself so much. 

Ive grown to hate everyone around me including myself. Maybe its the trauma and the abuse that people caused me.

My loneliness causes me to change from having a low or high ego sometimes all at once, I hate people who tell me they feel lonely its like I never had a single friend, I never had anyone care for me, I never had a true person I could trust, It feels like everyone is against me, planning against me. I get angry when people talk to me about their problems or tell me that they are depressed. Because they never listen to me, they never fucking ask me HOW ARE YOU DOING. Its always people ranting and venting to me. I don’t care if you were raped, I don’t care who died or if you died, I don’t care if you cut yourself or want to die, I don’t care who hurt you, I don’t care if you are abused. 

I feel so different from everyone, I can never fit in, Im always the odd one in every group. Genuinely my lack of social contact has cause me to grow so much hate for everyone around me. 

I can never truly trust anyone, I feel like I just don’t care about others, Its true Ive noticed my lack of care for people. Its odd. 

I can never be myself, I just want another person who’s toxic and hates people, not someone who pities me or tells me “no don’t hurt yourself. I just want someone who’s destructive like me, who would hurt others, who would hurt themselves. Yes its toxic but who cares about life. 

Morbid thoughts come up of how I just want to hurt everyone, make someone kill themselves. Everyone is so sensitive, I cant express how I feel without odd looks.

I could say “I don’t care if someone dies” 
All they say is “what If I died”

I’m 14 gonna be 15 in a couple months. I have no friends. No social life. I’m homeschooled because I hated being alone in school and watching other people have friends and I also got bullied for a bit there. People just hated me for no reason and they had their friends groups. Now month 4 of being homeschooled and I’m seeing a bunch of tiktoks about how summer is coming and friend groups are excited to hang out. I decided to check out some popular kids from my school on tiktok and they were posting about how excited they are to hang out in big friend groups in summer. 

This is so unfair. What did I do to deserve to be such an outcast? I’ve been chronically depressed these past couple years and thought about taking my life but it’s getting harder to keep going. I could scream when I see all the kids my age hanging out. The only time I leave my house is to hand in my work at the school once a week and I hate doing it. I feel like my teenage years are being trashed by myself. The thing is I can’t make friends because in my town people are so cold and rude. It’s shitty seaside town that I hate being in. This is so unfair that I can’t even have one friend to hang out with in summer. All I do is eat to make up for having such a shit life but that makes me more depressed.

Some backstory I am a 23 year old woman and during covid I lost my older brother and then six months later lost my aunt who was like a second mom to me and then six months after that I actually did lose my mom. My mom had cancer for a long time and it was very brutal and terrible to witness, I also lost my dad to cancer when I was very young. Since then I have struggled with alcoholism a lot and honestly I don’t feel like I can cry or cope with my feelings without it. About a little less than a year ago I cut ties with a friend I had had since fourth grade honestly we were inseparable but there were a lot of reasons why I had to do it. Since then I had two people I talked to regularly one friend and my boyfriend. I don’t get along well with a lot of my family they don’t really understand what I’ve gone through and they think that I am a disappointment to our family because I dropped out of college after my mom died. I know I Can do more with my life but I honestly needed time to heal. I recently broke up with my boyfriend because he was cheating on me and honestly just didn’t respect me or my feelings so I am down to one friend. I honestly don’t feel like I can truly talk to her about everything going on she has never lost a close family member or struggled with addiction. The one thing that brought me happiness consistently was my dog paris and unfortunately I had to put her down about a week ago. When I used to want to die I would tell myself think about how sad paris would be if you never came home and now I don’t have that. I honestly feel so empty inside and I don’t feel like I have anyone I can honestly talk to. I recently started a new job about 2 months ago and I feel like a lot of people there (at least the ones with influence) don’t like me for whatever reason and I am not happy there. I have a therapist but I don’t feel like she ever pushes deep to get to the root of the problem and she always cuts my sessions short. I don’t know what to do and I try to make friends but it’s so hard not having a deep connection with anyone. I was so used to knowing everyone for 5+ years and now I don’t have any friends like that. Honestly just putting this into words has made me feel a lot better and I am thankful that this community exists. 

I don’t want to end this on a bad note so here is a list of things that make me happy and want to see another day. 
Nature and being outside, creating things, skating, learning things, science, animals, fixing things, cheese, Halloween, putting on fluffy socks, taking care of my younger siblings, the way the leaves look in fall, making other people happy when they aren’t expecting anything

My wife and I separated six months ago. We have two children together aged five and two. I see them regularly, but adapting to the silence and a much less energetic environment is difficult after returning to my parents house around two months ago.

I’m feeling incredibly lonely at the moment. I’ve reconnected with some old friends and have tried to make new ones but struggle to ‘connect’ with people and maintain relationships. I don’t like myself very much and even the slightest sense of rejection leaves me feeling deeply hurt and withdrawn. This can be as simple as not receiving a reply to a text message – it makes it difficult for me to ‘put myself out there’ and creates a detrimental cyclical process: I’m lonely so I consider trying to meet new people, I feel rejected and I withdraw ceasing any attempt to make new friends.

This leaves me frustrated and, as I say, isolated. This isolation is really getting me down and I can't see it improving. I’m concerned that my sense of self is too closely linked to my relationships with other people. It feels almost narcissistic, particularly as I love receiving compliments from others even though I struggled to believe anyone that says anything nice to me is being genuine.

I also feel trapped. Having young children makes the very idea of taking my own life very difficult. I don’t really want to live any more as life is very painful, but I also don’t want to hurt my children.
I’ve dealt with these feelings for so long. I’ve been receiving various forms of treatment – including medication, counselling, CBT, etc. - for depression and anxiety for twenty years now.

I understand what they are going through at least a bit.

I often times think of what they must have been thinking and what their life and final moments were like, especially those that run off and disappear first or do it in nature.

I often think of the man who stole that airplane and crashed it, killing himself and his talk with air traffic control.  Sometimes I think of him as the patron saint of suicide.  Im sad he felt the way that he did but Im also glad that he got to go out in a way that was quite frankly spectacular.  I hope he is at peace.

This depression diagnosis has slowly by surely ruined my life and lost me my job, friends, and even the majority of my family, who decided to kick me out of the house and cut all contact with me. I have kept in touch with two close childhood friends (both female) and they are quite literally my only reasons to live. They listen to my problems, comfort me when I cry, and reassure me that things will get better. They are amazing people.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same about my mental health. I thought I had hit ""rock bottom"" about six months ago, but I've reached far below this level and I don't know what's up or down anymore - it just blends together. I don't have any structure to my day - I'm crashing on one of my friend's couches (bless her soul) and everyday is me feeling a cocktail of negative emotions, most prominently regret and disgust. I'm trying my best to help my friend's parents with whatever they need in order to help compensate them (cleaning, washing cars, mowing lawn, etc.), along with paying some money for rent here and there. I managed to hold onto my savings account which had a good amount of savings, but It's slowly seeping away since I don't have a job. 

Everytime I think I've ""recovered"" I just sink further into the dusty couch which I lay on most of the day. I discuss my emotions with my friend, here and there, but I just feel an overwhelming sense of disgust for myself whenever I see her - I am nothing like my younger self, and I feel like a huge burden to her and her family. Because of this, I feel like just leaving and living on the streets - it pains me so much to be in this situation. I don't think I can keep going much longer.

I have battled with depression my entire life. From teens to adulthood. I’ve always been socially awkward. So bad that it got to a point in middle school where I was bullied so bad I refused to leave the house in the morning to go. 

Looking back on things the last few days, I’ve realized there is so much I have missed out on in life. I’ve never been on a date. No prom, didn’t graduate high school. Never had a relationship. No crushes or any that asked me out. I can’t have kids. Currently I’m not working because of my mental health and I’m not sure my physical health would allow me to do much. I feel useless. 

I’m struggling to stay above water as I’m caring for both of my disabled parents along with my aunt with no help from family or my brother. I live with my parents and have my whole life. At this point I don’t feel like I’ll ever be able to support myself if something happens to them. Things are so expensive it’s practically impossible for a single income to survive. 

I don’t know where else to turn. I feel lost and don’t feel as if I belong in this world. My family gave up on me 10-12years ago when I struggled with a drug addiction. The friends I’ve had only were “friends” because I was naive and gullible enough to believe they cared but they only used me. 

I was kicked out of school after double knee surgery because the school lost my work after the homeschool teacher turned it in. My mom didn’t even put up a fight. She let it happen 😔 That started everything when it came to my social withdrawal. I spent over 5yrs in the house and never left. Not even to go get the mail. Cut off my “friends”. Totally disconnected from reality altogether. 

I’ve realized all the connections with good people I’ve had, have been online. Irl I feel like a tin can on the side of the highway, getting shoved around every time someone’s passes.

""Go take a shower, freshen up, make yourself pretty."" Done that; I still feel hollow. Even worse, making myself or feeling prettier reminds me of the hollowness I feel when sleazy men with ulterior motives makes me feel like Barbie. 

Imagine only being desirable because you're relatively young, supposedly pretty or sexy cos you're young and vulnerable. 

It's so sad and very disturbing how so many of us come from troubled backgrounds that we end up seeking or chasing after that sense of security we never got. In some people, the sense of security is such a foreign concept or feeling that they can't do without cortisol. 

I'm overly stretched out and just beaten having to accommodate people that are not exactly someone I'm comfortable with just out of courtesy because I don't wanna hurt people either and as we've learned in preschool ""Do not do to others what you don't want done to yourself."" 

So as much as some voices or opinions may say ""Just cut them off/Block them/State your part and Leave."" Diplomacy must Exist when engaging socially. Because it's a responsibility we all have and Being left in the dark without any closure or Reasoning is cruel. 

So I try to find ways to soften the blow as it is a responsibility that I have to keep it professional and diplomatic as possible. 

Many tend to not take rejection nicely which is understandable. It's sad. And no matter how poorly someone may have behaved, or simply incompatible you were with them, they may have had well, tried, and put themselves vulnerably out there. 2 big things I think children were not taught properly were 1. How to handle melt downs. 2. How to handle denial and rejection. That's why often it leads to aggression, shockingly even in adults. Everything's a trauma response.

As someone aware of this, I do not have any intention of feeding fuel to the fire and reinforcing the trauma they have by failing to let them know how it's just how it is and diversity exists and so does differences and that they're not necessarily bad, just that we're incompatible. 

But I've digressed. 

What do you do and how do you cope with isolation & depression because you just can't move anymore. 

Drinking alcohol is obviously just going to make us feel worse, ruining our organs, body and just not helpful it's the opposite of a solution. I never got to relate with it. I strive to be healthy in terms of avoiding junk food and these blatant hazards for health. 

I tried dance exercising while playing old jams but it soon feels hollow when you're alone and for whatever reason the vitality exuding from dancing is somehow linked to sexuality or that kind of energy which just makes me even more put off. 

I read. I rewatch films and shows I connect with. They're basically what's keeping me sane xD

I don't really have the energy to tip toe and keep this large part of me now, and pretend otherwise and just try to make friends or whatever under the pretense of being okay cos that's hollow itself. 

Friends are someone we relate with deeply and connect with. 

So again, What do you do? 

I'm sorry, I absolutely hate sweating and the last time I decided to exercise this gross disturbing feeling out, the depression, I ended up getting sick the very next day lethargic with a fever and light headedness xD I also lost my voice for nearly a month. 

I've been trying yoga poses or half a pilates but I just really wish I had best friends or I don't know, someone I can trust and count on. .

So how do you do it? 

(※ For some who may think ""detach, and stop with the me, me, me personalisation of things"", I find it so wonderful and heart warming that there are people who understands deeply having experienced the sensation and predicament first hand, while it's also very tragic how any life form simply will not register an information until it becomes personal to them through experience. Exposure. Abuse.) 

Try - Colbie Caillat
Human - Christina Perri
Perfect - P!nk 
Cigarettes after Sex Album and more. 

Just some music that comes to my mind when I read this from the top. Music helps? It's a voice like shows and films. But having a special voice just for us through the intimacy we have with good friends is unbeatable. 

So I hope those of you who feel the same way, lonely, isolated find that friendship you're looking for. 

Cos for me, I don't know anymore. 

How do I go on about this? 
I'd like something genuine with someone who's sincere.

But do you feel disgusted, too, kind of yourself for basically being depressed even though it's supposedly normal, just cos we're not presentable in our current state? And that keeping us from feeling comfortable socialising because why the hell would anyone want to have anything to do with us? It's patronising perhaps as considerate as it is, but In theory, the companionship or relatability we may be able to offer them could be enough. But we live in a harsh society full of judgements and criticism. And that is normal. Human society is complex and diverse. I say so, because there are things I personally wouldn't feel very comfortable with, as well. That's why I find studying eusocial animals intriguing. Fascinating. Maybe the animal kingdom can teach us a thing or two about management? btw I love nature related documentaries xD

It got really long, I'm sorry. 

But I hope you find your answers and I hope some people may offer wholesome things that cheered them up or how they cope and such. 

I journal, too. 

And then I came across a random short on YouTube about a stressed out librarian lady who had two little boys with chaotic energy coming in, asking for two copies of the same book because they were going to stay up and read them on their sleepover and that was so wholesome and adorable. 

Basically, there are still positive things that encourages optimism. 

So if you have similar stories, Please Share. 

Those of us who will see it may smile about it xD ☺️ 

Thank you for taking the time to read. 
I wish you a lovely day, then :) 

Or a good night. 

Please take care and I hope it wasn't too vexing a perspective to read.",1691658938.0,depression

My mom is a very toxic person and has said/done a lot of mean things such as, talked about my significant other about my last relationship and constantly comparing my current girlfriend to my ex. My current girlfriend is also a different race than my family and my mom has said racist things to my girlfriend. A few months ago my mom said something that really set her off. I cussed my mom out and stopped talking to her for awhile. Eventually my girlfriend said we should talk to my mom again and we did.

Her gym membership is $180 month. (I know expensive but comes with multiple classes also.) Yesterday I said I got my tax return and said we'll buy the purse. My mom went off saying we shouldn't buy something when there's other things that are more important. She went on a rant saying my girlfriend is just using me for money and that she doesn't love me. My mom also told my girlfriend a month ago that she should rethink being with me. My mom always starts drama and this time it almost ended my relationship. I told my mom to stop and she kept harassing my girlfriend saying that she'll come over our home if we don't talk to her. I eventually blocked her and she had my cousin call me saying we need to sit down with her and work it out. She said my mom treated me so well growing up and I shouldn't cut her off because this. I told her don't fucking say that because I only seen you during holidays and everything my mom says is only good things about herself because she's self-centered.

I hope you're doing well today. I'm here to open up about some personal struggles I'm facing and to seek guidance from this incredible community. As a young male in my 20's, I find myself dealing with feelings of insecurity, loneliness, anxiety, and depression.

Firstly, insecurity has been weighing me down lately, and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced similar feelings and how they were able to overcome them. Are there any strategies or techniques that have helped boost your self-esteem and confidence? I would appreciate any advice or personal stories you can offer in this regard.

Secondly, the weight of loneliness has been taking its toll on me. I'm curious to know how others have navigated this feeling and found meaningful connections. Do you have any suggestions, whether it's finding new hobbies, joining social groups, or maybe even trying a new approach to online networking?

Lastly, I'd like to touch on anxiety and depression. While I'm aware that seeking professional help is important, I'm interested to hear if any of you have found comfort in self-care practices, such as exercise, mindfulness, or creative outlets, that have helped alleviate these symptoms.

I truly appreciate any insights, stories, or resources you can share. Let's come together as a community and support one another through these challenging times.

I 19(M) am in the high functioning range of the autism spectrum but I also have pretty severe ADD and a general anxiety disorder. I recently got diagnosed with depression which really isn’t a surprising but it hurt to confirm it. It makes me feel like even more of a broken human being. I haven’t had a true friend since probably elementary school. As I got older it became more apparent to others I’m not like everyone else. While they probably can’t tell why I think I tends to lead people to find me creepy or think I’m severely mentally disabled. I’m almost certain this is what caused most of my childhood friends to stop caring and talking to me much and in one case even come to hate me. I’ve never recovered since the end of middle school when it all burnt down. I’ve also not so much as been friends with a girl since maybe 3rd grade and the fact women tend to notice I’m different more easily it makes interaction even more difficult. Because of this I used to think I was asexual but then I finally had a crush on a coworker at my first job when I was 15. Someone told her how I felt and without me asking her out she said she wasn’t in a good place for relationships at the time. She started dating the pot head 2 weeks later. Because of all this I’ve missed out on pretty much every teen experience and now I think I won’t get any of the young adult ones either. I feel like I’ll be alone forever and having read stories and seen statistics about people like me that seems very likely. I wish I had a worse mental disability so at least I wouldn’t be aware how much my life sucks.,1676868866.0,depression

The main problem that is bothering me is an extreme body dysmorohia and eating disorders.

It feels like if I get skinny or fit enough people will notice me and sadly it is true.

In my life I basically had two “glow ups”. I’ll explain... :
First one was when I was pretty much a kid 13-14yo. I was overweight until 13 - my only friends were food and video games and when all of that teenagery puberty bullshit hit and bullying started I became body dysmorphic and went to extreme anorexia type weight loss. I was actually sick, like my body was fucked up by so much weight loss, but I loved how people commented on how good I looked... I was finally seen for the first time. Girls wanted to be like me, asked for tips, tried to befriend me. Guys were pretty immature at the time (still somehow at that “ew girls” phase in my class) but still showed more attention to me AND what was the most fucked up thing is that teachers even praised my weight loss too (remember the fact that I was anorexic thin, not just skinny...).

Anyways life hit me, I had to recover and I swung to the other side of pendulum - I was going through hard time and I started binge eating and seeling comfort in food again. That of course lead me to weight gain. And you guessed it! People just wanished. No more skinny me - no more interest from others. I tried to go back to being skinny which lead me to have binge and restrict cycles. Some people even made fun of me that I gained weight. I developed social anxiety which just made everything even worse - I actually ended up homeschooled because I just couldnt be in public places anymore. It continued till i was 17. 

On 2019 I managed to “get back to it”. Started working out again. This time I lost weight in a bit more healthy way, but still it was pretty extreme. At the start of 2020 I was lean and fit. And you guessed it! I got compliments from people again. This time tho - it was my neighbors from my neighborhood. They told me how I was a little thick in the past and how good I looked now. I even ended up with a girlfriend from dating app and I got lots of attention from random guys (I am a lesbian but I still enjoyed that).
Fast forward to september - i had a slip up and emotional break down - binge eating again, all weight back up again, same fucking people ignoring me again. Loneliness again...

Im seriously contemplaiting on starving myself now again. Im still in my binge eating period but the loneliness and mean people are getting old to me...

192,2813.0,What sustains you?,2,13tvtji,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/13tvtji/what_sustains_you/,4,"I've apparently reached the stage in my life where I can't stop thinking about all the things I'll never have, do, be, or experience. All the loneliness of my wasted and worthless life has really started to crash down on me like a tsunami wave. I'm not yet at what people call ""midlife"", and since the crises of youth never actually ended, I don't know how I could have a midlife crisis. But whatever this is called, I have to do something about it, even if that's just opening the pressure valve on this mental water heater before it rockets through the roof of my mind. Yes, I tortured that metaphor like the CIA with a suspected terrorist, leave me alone. So, much like NASA with its Voyager craft and golden record, I'm simply going to send these thoughts off into that universal, digital void, with greetings and a question to pose. Starting in T-Minus 3... 2... 1...

Hello, fellow lonely people! What do you have that sustains you?

I try very hard not to dwell on these negative thoughts and feelings, but it is very difficult when there isn't much positive to focus on (yes I obviously fail at it). Every little thing I've ever actually had is being taken away, and I fear the speed of this larceny is ramping up considerably. All of the terrible things that have been happening this year, as well as the year before, are really starting to get to me, and it's gotten me thinking, how nice would it be to have something to fall back on, something to lean on or into? Even if that thing or things doesn't help you make friends, or find mates, they can at least be \*something\*. I don't have any real reference for what that might be like. I don't have any talents, skills, abilities, special knowledge, or training. I'm not good at anything. I've never succeeded, won at, or achieved anything. I remember very little, and my capability for recalling something I do remember is even worse. I'm not charming, entertaining, funny, or even particularly intelligent. I have no money or property. I'm not strong, handsome, sexy, or attractive. I don't really have any friends or family that actually like me. A small sidenote; before anyone cites ""negativity"" as the reason why no one likes me, I'd like to say that I never express these truths to anyone I know. I always pretend to be upbeat, generally happy and am always kind and friendly to everyone. Still, I'll never have a close friend group. I'll never have a friend that actually cares, wonders how I'm doing or how my day went, or wants to spend time with me. I'll never not be poor. No one is ever going to pay me to do anything that isn't manual labor or customer service. I'll never be able to play an instrument, make great art, or do anything that would make people cheer, feel some deep emotion, laugh, or even just make them feel happy.

I'll never have a family of my own, and much less a mate. I'll never know what it's like for a woman to deeply love me and passionately desire me. At least not a woman without serious mental disorders. I'm not shaming or putting down people with mental disorders (I have my own problems with severe anxiety). I'm talking about the kind of mental problems that inflict terrible pain on others. I have had a couple of stalkers in my life, at least one of them in real life, and that one physically threatened me. I've been sexually harassed and mildly assaulted by girls and women. Even though, since about third grade, most of the attention I ever got from girls was mocking, derisive, bullying, name-calling, laughter, and looks of general disgust. I know by experience and observation that life is intrinsically unfair, but having to experience the polar opposite, negative behaviors of dislike, as well as infatuation, seems just a little bit fucking extra to me. Please understand, I am not the ""I"" word that shall not be mentioned. I think the fact that I've always had such negative interactions with most women outside of my family, has seriously crippled me, and honestly, I don't think I ever had much of a chance. But I have sympathy and empathy for those people who were struggling mentally and mistreated me. I know they probably went through terrible things in their own life, and couldn't help the way their minds worked. I'm not some misogynist, but I guess in the dark recesses of my mind and heart, I am a bit of a misanthrope.

The things that I'm going through now have spurred me on to truly try and make serious improvements and steps ""forward"", even though my efforts have led to nothing and almost certainly never will. The clock has essentially run out, but I will continue anyway, maybe just to chase ""hope"", or because I hate myself and I deserve to suffer. I'm not really sure which.

I'm touch starved, most of the activities I do are meant for one person so, yeah, I just don't connect with anyone. Anyways, I do like being alone, but hate feeling alone.

For these reasons, I've been reading a lot about mental health and personality disorders. And I feel that most symptoms from AvPD relate to my personality and way of life.

I've always felt like an outcast in my country and my culture. I probably shouldn't even call them ""mine"". Always worrying about being wrong in the most trifling things and overthinking about them for days, or even weeks. Sadly I live in a part of the world where people are very ""warm"" but also quite ""wacky"" in a (for me) annoying way.

So… to keep it less triggering and more on point, I’m going to try to boil it down to main points. Stick with me here, for a mini timeline for reference. Also I’m 29F.

1. Born into mental illness, extreme family trauma and abuse, and poverty. 

2. Contracted viral meningitis at 6 months, got a TBI that wasn’t picked up on until 20+ years old.

3. Good to note that my mother started me in therapy consistently at 10. 

4. Homeless after family explosion

5. Used as a token to play tug of war with from all adults, while under 18. None of needs met.

6. Graduated high school, was extremely ill with mental disorders that manifest physically, yadda yadda. 

7. Placement in various hospitals and programs

8. Learned that I learn differently and poured everything into my college education. I graduated with a BA. 

9. Other people almost took my life.

10. The last hospital, they gave me ECT, Electroconvulsive therapy. 

11. I have been trying to understand, re learn, and live life again, but now with persistent everyday short term memory loss, Aphasia, and some long term memory loss. As well as initial problems, including emotional dysregulation.   
——

So basically that list gives a teeny tiny bit of background. I was always a people pleaser to survive. I’ve been in and out of many treatments, always do therapy. 

I used to be able to do so many things. I was incredibly smart. I worked very hard and put in blood, sweat, and tears. 

But it was making me crazy because of all of the underlying trauma. 

It came to an emergent head, and the only option given to me was ECT, I have gone through all other options. 

The point of this post is that I am more isolated than I have ever been in life. 

I try to talk about things and have memory issues, then emotional issues, and it’s gone. 

Writing seems easier because I can take an hour to write, like in this post, use google for words, etc.

When things come back in my memory that I was trying to talk about before, I can’t interrupt others, once I can talk, it’s gone. 

Things make me cringe hard that didn’t used to, like too much light, noise, anything..and I can’t think. The TBI from childhood got worse, but now I can’t work so I have state insurance and cannot get into a neuropsych, for an updated scan. 

I was really great (from working really hard) at public speaking and worked in customer service for animal medical care. 

Now I can’t hold normal conversations. I don’t know how to talk without letting people know just the tip of the iceberg, of why I talk differently. 

But of course, when meeting someone, you don’t tell them your frikkin life story or traumas, so I have no idea where to start.

Sentences come out of my mouth and kind of make sense. It makes the most sense to people who knew me before.

I don’t know how to make friendships or date anymore. I’m so freaking lonely. It’s been 1 year and 6 months since that treatment. 

Any advice on how to talk to people? I want to be able to date again. I want to have multiple friends again.",1682361965.0,mental_disorder

I struggle with Asperger's syndrome that I have had since I was born, and mental illness runs in my family. My father suffers from a range of mental disorders including sociopathy, which makes him excellent at covering up his mental illness from everyone especially my own mother. She didn't know mental illness ran in his side of the family and when I was born those same issues were passed down to me and I feel like it's a life curse.

I never had a strong family and friend connection growing up and all through elementary and high school I was a weird loner, and I didn't know what was wrong with myself and why I could never form bonds or friendships with other people. Now I am struggling so much in life because it's so hard for me to manage anything I do or get involved in and I am realizing the hard way the results of the way I grew up and lived for all my young life being isolated and never being able to connect with other people.

Now when I want to try and make new friends and put myself out there, I always feel socially awkward, and that people feel something is wrong with me. Even in a group setting I feel self-conscious about being the weird one in the group. I am paranoid about my facial expressions around other people because I am so used to not smiling at people all my life that it doesn't come naturally to me. I find myself lately lusting for a romantic female companion, but I struggle to know if it's what I really want in life or if it's just something to help ease my pain.

Now I struggle to even be around other people around my age because it makes me so jealous and angry seeing them being able to hold conversations so easily and have great friend communities while I am lagging behind them in life and struggling just to even say something. I feel especially hopeless with girls because even though I think I am decent looking, my personality is just so boring and dull in order to be considered boyfriend material. As a young adult now that I need these critical people skills, I don't have them and it's making me miss out.

I feel like I can never accomplish anything more than just being an acquaintance to someone because I struggle to get anyone to even acknowledge my presence and enjoy my company. Every time I hear about someone's accomplishments and the things they did I feel a deep sense of despair within myself because I feel as though I can't ever accomplish anything they can. I don't even know what to do, my life just seems to suck so much compared to other people and rarely do I even feel moments of genuine happiness or accomplishment.

I 19(M) am in the high functioning range of the autism spectrum but I also have pretty severe ADD and a general anxiety disorder. I recently got diagnosed with depression which really isn’t a surprising but it hurt to confirm it. It makes me feel like even more of a broken human being. I haven’t had a true friend since probably elementary school. As I got older it became more apparent to others I’m not like everyone else. While they probably can’t tell why I think I tends to lead people to find me creepy or think I’m severely mentally disabled. I’m almost certain this is what caused most of my childhood friends to stop caring and talking to me much and in one case even come to hate me. I’ve never recovered since the end of middle school when it all burnt down. I’ve also not so much as been friends with a girl since maybe 3rd grade and the fact women tend to notice I’m different more easily it makes interaction even more difficult. Because of this I used to think I was asexual but then I finally had a crush on a coworker at my first job when I was 15. Someone told her how I felt and without me asking her out she said she wasn’t in a good place for relationships at the time. She started dating the pot head 2 weeks later. Because of all this I’ve missed out on pretty much every teen experience and now I think I won’t get any of the young adult ones either. I feel like I’ll be alone forever and having read stories and seen statistics about people like me that seems very likely. I wish I had a worse mental disability so at least I wouldn’t be aware how much my life sucks.,1676868866.0,mental_disorder

I am not interested in running as an activity, and that is all my family does. When we go on a trip all together, my sister always brings her partner along, and has since we were teenagers. I have never had the opportunity to bring someone along. My family will go out running for 2+ hours daily, leaving me completely alone. If we go to a city, which is not often, it's fine-i can go out by myself. But, we typically go to more rural places where I'd have to drive to get to a place. The issue is they take the car to get to the trails they run. 
I sit in the hotel or house we're staying in completely alone, nothing to do or no one to talk to for hours a day, looking out the window waiting for them to come home. They then need to shower, nap, and recover, which means even more alone time for me.

My current obsession has been going on for six years, it’s so painful and tiring but the attachment is so strong. I can’t seem to walk away from a ‘love’ that doesn’t even make me feel good and that frightens me. I don’t think this obsessive fixation is love? I guess on the outside it looks like I have the ability to love people romantically but it’s definitely not healthy, it’s one sided and it’s foundations are usually rooted in my insecurity so it doesn’t really feel genuine. I’ve been seeing a therapist for over 13 years and I’m starting to doubt whether it’s something I can fix or change, it’s so unyielding and it’s been a pattern since I was an early teen. I have only been ‘loved’ back by one person and it was for 3 months but we were so young and it was so short lived that it doesn’t feel like enough to keep my hope of being loved one day alive.

I’m well into my 30’s now, and for about 16 months I’ve spent just about every night alone. I still think about my ex gf from 10yrs ago - every day. Of my 3 serious ex girlfriends; one committed suicide, and 2 got married.

Admittedly, I am very much co dependent; without intimacy, or at very minimum friendships, my mental health takes a huge toll. My sleep, my job performance, my appetite are all f-cked up. Some days I don’t want to wake up.

I know there’s not much to say, and I don’t really have anything to ask. I just really need to vent.

I miss my ex girlfriend, my dad, my dog, so many friends, and being happy. I haven’t been happy in many years. I have panic disorder + PTSD, I often wonder if I’ll ever have sustained happiness. Or a family of my own.

I lived fast and partied hard when I was young, never thinking I’d make it past my 20’s. I’ve partied with celebrities, musicians, and had sex with a lot of gorgeous females. Now late 30’s, the party feels over, officially.

I'm struggling with immense loneliness atm and I know I'm not the only one, especially since covid. I'm a first year university student and the pandemic has made it very difficult for me to make friends. I only made one, who I ended up dating and breaking up with a few months later, so we're not on the best terms rn. Now I'm 300 miles away from family, living alone with no friends near or far. It's tough. 

I'm moving out of student halls today and it's stressful doing it all alone and seeing all the students moving out in their parents' cars. My parents can't drive and we're too poor to travel. It's tough because I keep thinking, ""why do they get to have their parents' support them and I don't?"". It's unfair but it's the way life is. Plus, it gives me ample opportunity to be more independent and that can only be a good thing whilst also giving me a kick up the behind to save for driving lessons. 

I lost a lot of friends this year by being an ass. I was struggling with my mental health and living in my parents living room in their one bedroom apartment due to unforseen circumstances. I was angry at my friends' privilege. Super unattractive and it's not gonna make anyone's life better to be resentful. Nonetheless, I was so petulant about the fact that they had money, their own rooms, could go on holidays and had all the things I couldn't. I couldn't see at the time that *I* was privileged in ways they weren't. I see now that the world doesn't revolve around me and every person has unique struggles and experiences; comparing them isn't going to get anyone anywhere. 

I also got angry that they had partners when I'd just had the worst breakup of my life and they had no mental health issues. I was so hung up on the fact that they ""didn't understand me"". I wanna slap younger me round the face because wtf. Truly. They did their best to support me but they didn't need to understand to be empathetic and they were. I was palming off responsibility for improving my situation by focusing on what they had so easily. Yeah, I will have to work twice as hard for a stable life, but it will feel good to know I didn't give into poverty and mental ill health. I got dealt a bad hand from childhood, but how much longer am I going to cling to that as an excuse to stagnate? 

The running theme through this and the root cause of my loneliness is that I'm still struggling with resentment. I really try not to because it pushes people away and hurts them, but it's hard. I try and see my blessings, like my best friend and my pets. It's a process that will take me a while but I want to work at it. 

I want to try and reconcile with my old friends but I hurt them a lot and I don't know if they'd be open to it. I suspect I am suffering from a personality disorder of some kind and they also run in the family so it's likely. It's not an excuse for how I was acting, but it would explain my wild mood swings and blowing hot and cold with people. I'm nervous about approaching them to reconcile if they'd be open to it because I still don't have access to a psychological assessment for at least another five months, which means treatment for anything I have could be way off. I'm scared if I make things right with them that I'll just hurt them again because I'm untreated. I learnt a lot from the situation and how to enforce/respect boundaries, but it's still a concern. It's something to let them know about I suppose. 


If anyone has any advice to deal with feeling resentment and getting caught up in the fact that you got dealt a bad hand, please do let me know. Atm, I'm working on gratitude at the moment and making changes in my life to feel more autonomous. 

Thanks so much 
Amo

If you're here you probably need a friend and I'm probably no exception either. Life has been tough for me a fair amount of times and because of chronic anhedonia I have some interests but I've never felt passionate enough to connect with people over them. So now I decided, what if that's not what I try to connect with people over? I find making a difference meaningful so maybe I can use my experience with overcoming certain obstacles to help someone else out? And maybe a friendship can grow from that.

I'm a swede living in southern Germany together with my girlfriend (whom I love very much so please be aware that there are no romantic prospects with me). In a month I'll start a Higher Vocational in Geographic Information Technology so that's where I'm headed, as a quick way to introduce myself.

Mental health areas I have experience in dealing with or overcoming:

* Harmful relationships
* The meaninglessness of life
* Anhedonia
* Chronic insomnia
* Struggling with education
* Loneliness
* Body image and eating disorders

Other areas of interest that I can talk about (does not mean I'm knowledgeable but that I would enjoy it):

* Geography
* City planning
* Feminism
* Veganism
* Gaming
* History
* Sociology
* (SFW) Role-playing (in the sense that I used to Role-Play in World of Warcraft years ago but never quite let go of it due to how it formed the social backbone of my younger years and was something I really enjoyed. I've never done TTRPGs but the idea of being a GM appeals to me some.)
* Sustainability
* Hiking and the outdoors

Of course I can talk about other things too but now you have a better idea of who I am. I'd like to talk to any gender, transitioned or nonbinary, 18 or above.

I am no stranger to discussing mental illness on reddit. In fact, I probably talk about it more than I talk about anything (except maybe gaming).

I was diagnosed at 8 with ADHD and general anxiety disorder. I didn't know this until i was 22 and had always thought i was just a weird person who was destined to feel different and more hyper than everyone. It made me feel like a social pariah and like I wasn't deserving of love. At 19 though, I did come to terms with part of my identity: I was an alcoholic.

I had binge drank, drunk drove, got sent to the hospital, got in blackout fights, and finally after shitting my pants one night after a particularly bad blackout (i drank tobasco sauce in addition to a bottle of grey goose and 10 beers). I decided enough was enough. 3 months later i was in AA and stringing together consistent sobriety. 6 months after that my mom admitted she was an alcoholic and quit with me (she is now 4 and a half years sober).

So why do i share this? who cares? THAT IS MY POINT. People do care. people out there feel the same and work on writing to a reddit forum to hide their identity and talk about these things. Well, I am trying to be more public about my mental illness. I started a website ([www.propositivity.com](https://www.propositivity.com/)) and I started streaming to talk to teens and young adults about mental illness. ([Twitch.tv/spidermojo](https://twitch.tv/spidermojo) a follow is appreciated but not necessary).

I went on anti-depressants at 22 and my life changed for the better. I know that it is not this easy for many, but i want everyone to know i am there for them. If you feel like noone understands you, give me a shot. I will at least do my best to understand and at the VERY LEAST I will hear you and show you you are loved.

We can't all be blessed with money, or health, or happiness, but we sure as hell can try to improve together.

Love all,

Hey guys, I’ve seen this subreddit a couple times and I see that my experiences are nothing like yours. I grew up getting girls all the time. I met the one I love very young, in 8th grade (2012). We started dating my sophomore year of high school (2014) and we got married just last August. I’m turning 21 next month.

My wife has lots of mental issues(PTSD, survivors guilt, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and some other personality disorder) But for most of our relationship that have been for the most part manageable. But for a significant amount of it she has been in charge. She gets so angry all the time about the littlest things and she takes it all out on me. I’ve made mistakes in our relationship but I have never cheated on her. I love her so much. But recently I don’t think she loves me. I’ve always known that she is bisexual. And she always told me if we broke up she was going to go back to girls forever. Well within the last two weeks she has been really struggling with her feelings about girls. And she has asked for space so she can figure them out. By that I mean she wants to experience being a lesbian with no distractions. She kicks me out of my own bed and my own apartment because I’m a distraction.

Just last night she texted me while I was spending the weekend away at my dads that she misses me and she’s sorry for the way she treats me and that I deserve so much better than her. I think she is making a change for the better. But I come home tonight and she won’t talk to me. She is throwing things. Yelling at me. Insulting me. And now she has locked herself in the bedroom and is posting snapchats about her being a victim. I confide my feelings in myself and one or two other friends. But for the most part just me. 

She wonders why I’m not the person I used to be but that’s because she has ruined me. I used to cry a lot but now I haven’t cried since 2017 when my dog passed away. I don’t want to lose her and I don’t want to look for love elsewhere, as tempting as it would be to get with a new girl. I just wish she actually treated me like I matter to her and not like she is only putting up with me for the rest of her life, if she chooses to stay with me after this soul searching she is doing.

I’ve contemplated ending my life a couple times. I have a concealed carry pistol in the night stand. But I really don’t want to die. And I can’t drink my feelings away because I have a liver disease. And I’m not into weed. All I can do is make myself numb and stop thinking about it. I want her but she won’t let me be myself. And she won’t give me the comfort I need as a human.

But anyways, I'm (28F) and I always say I have 5 best friends. Outside of that, plenty of people I like, but just...we either don't go out of our way to hang out much, or we don't vibe the right way together (if that makes sense.)

But lately, that's just...not true. One friend (32M) I've known since highschool, but he leans hard left to the point of us butting heads--when I lean left. And he's convinced my boyfriend (24M) is a walking red flag because of the dumbest reasons. And I can't be open with him about my past--I've done some dumb shit, but years ago. I make a joke and I get a scolding from him like he's my parent, like it happened yesterday instead of when I was 22yo.

So, I just...have to avoid a lot of subjects with him, which is getting exhausting. And I'm not a fan of his situation, but he wouldn't listen to me if I explained what I was seeing. I did once--very gently--and he waved everything away. I don't plan on ghosting him or anything, and I'll always consider him close. But I can't...go to him about almost anything at this point.

Another best friend, I reconnected with after a toxic relationship. I was in his (36M) wedding. I think his wife (34F) is awesome. Now, we rarely talk--and his wife was ""bestie"" by association. Not in a bad way, we just have never been like that with each other.

Fourth best friend (28M) is a special kind of best friend. We've known each other for a decade and were so close that he'll always have that ""best friend"" spot in my heart. But still, we don't have heart-to-hearts. I don't think he'd mind listening to me rant at all, but that's just not usually part of our friendship.

Then there's my BEST friend. She's (32F) amazing. I honestly don't know how to describe how dear she is to me. She -is- someone I can turn to whenever I need to, and I don't have to worry about offending her. We're comfortable with each other, and that is an incredibly rare situation for me.

But.

The first ""best"" friend? Sadly, I can't justify the ""title"" anymore. It's not like I'm losing him completely, but it feels like I am at the same time. He's not the man I met, and not necessarily all in a good way.

Second and third? I mean. They're both busy, so am I. I gotta be understanding of that. And let's be honest. Just because someone is married to your best friend, it does not immediately make them a ""bestie"" too. So with the third, I don't think that ever actually counted.

Fourth? Like I said, he's got the title permanently. But the title only means so much.

So...it's gotten to the point where I'm basically just relying on my BEST best friend. And she's planning a wedding, raising a teenager, juggling work hours, moving--whatever stressful inconvenience you can think of, add that to her plate. For instance, right now she has COVID so the bachelorette (obviously) party got rescheduled.

Ugh. The main point is that I was so proud to go from meaningless crowds of ""friends"" to five people I could always count on, and vice versa. But I got a -lot- of issues, mental disorders. And hell, I talk a LOT. I will write you a novel as a text message, and I won't care. We don't even have to be close.

But today felt...wrong. I sent her a long-ass story about feeling like I'm ""loosing"" friend #1. I did NOT expect a response. She had plenty to deal with. But she did...kinda. Nothing bad, nothing to hold against her. But she said, ""whoa that's a lot, gimme a second!"" And forgot to ACTUALLY reply. (This happens a lot.)

The other day, someone in the bridal party told me those long-ass texts were more than fine, and that's how she texted too. But then after a few times of her not responding, I asked if it was bothering her--and she told me to calm down on the texting, please.

My partner, same situation.

Everyone has their own reasons, and I can completely understand most of them. However, I'm an insecure mess. Hearing that I was overwhelming at least 2 people, possibly more, just...made me want to shut down and be quiet. It's easier to not text at all than run the risk of getting too excited and blowing up someone's phone when they've asked me not to.

On top of that, I'm now super dependent on my best friend. I get the feeling that I'm overwhelming her too--so I feel terrible and the pressure on both of us to have her be my ONLY source of social support is greatly unfair to both of us. None of this is on purpose, I'm just that kind of person that if I don't share a thought RIGHT NOW, it's gone forever.

And I'm a depressy mess. I look for more outside validation than I'd like to admit. I have to be reassured about things repeatedly, and I know it can get annoying.

Maybe I just don't know how to be alone. I don't know. I've been turning to reddit more and more because, hey, at the worst I might get judged a bit on the Internet. 

It's just so weird knowing I have friends...but feeling like it's not real. I think the main problem is that the draining feeling that I'm just ""too much""--even to the closest people in my life. I don't think they're telling me ""turn down your personality please"" but hello insecurities! 

That ""too much"" has always been a problem. Got # complex back in highschool from--you guessed it--my ""best friend"" (at the time.)

And what's even more frustrating, is that none of these words feel right. I sound like, Oh, wah. My friends think I text too much. Boohoo.

But it's not, really. It's that these were my best friends because I felt like I could come to them always with anything, any time. But my depression/other issues have been relatively extreme lately, and all of it is now falling on both best friend #1 and my partner. And I don't want the day to come where they tell me to stop talking so much because they can't handle my ""drama."" I know I'm being a little paranoid--they know I'm depressed and how that affects me. But if it's overwhelming for me, I can't imagine what it would feel like to have someone else dumping their problems on your lap 24/7. 

So, I mean, that's gotta be something I need to fix for myself.

But, I think that sums up pretty well why I'm feeling lonely.",1694726868.0,mental_disorder
215,2929.0,I just wondering how am i supposed to make friends at age 22 now everything seems fucked up...,2,12o51ta,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/12o51ta/i_just_wondering_how_am_i_supposed_to_make/,1," 

I knew i was different... From a young age, I always enjoyed my own company... And highly introverted... During childhood it was the happiest year of my life... To think back then I made more friends when i was a kid than an adult lol ...

Highschool was fucking nightmare at the time i was dealing with addiction, social anxiety and major depressive episodes, everyday life i went to bed with anxious and depressed, i had suicidal thoughts each and everyday..., when i woke up depressed and anxious same cycle for years... I lost most of my friends and i was considered loser, weak, nerd, geek whatever you name it... it turned most of my childhood friends off But no one tried to bully me since i was quiet and serious also all my friends from preschool are popular people and some sort of gangshit, back then we were still in touch... I always avoid making new contacts and prefer close friends... Small circle ofc...

Talking about studying high school I did not do well cause of mental issues... I am lacking focus, i never review or learn anything cause i was in my own head most of the time... I spend time drawing. Lol i still wondered how the fuck i passed all those class when i didn't even learn anything... Weird is i got decent grades lol

From mental issues and insecurities... i was easily hurt and mentally dependent, i cut off most friends from my mental health... I was screaming for help and understanding... I could not afford therapy, so I decided to cure myself... It was 2018 when i decided to cut off my addiction and started to overcome my anxiety processing... It was one hell of a recovery journey without professional help... During withdrawal episodes, it was crippled anxiety and major depressive episodes... Due to the unbalanced brain chemical of dopamine... I fought so hard alone trying to get my life back together... I cut off people who know me, when i was at my lowest point of life... Cause i wasn't myself...

Again another horrific event... after a year of recovered addiction.... I lost myself once again... Cause i was too lonely, i craved people's company, and meanings in life, i saw people on social media having fun posting pictures together and tagging each other was so much fun... I thought having friends would make me happier... It was really painful memories... Even though my anxiety was still killing me but at least, i got socializing... I joined a club full of people, and they had a moto of being nice to each other... I fell into that, cause i was craving happiness... I tried to change my own personality and went against my own nature... Just to be likeable... I shut off my Te entirely and focused more on my Fe... that's how everything went downhill... People view me as a clown and look down on me etc.. i was hurt after being excluded and abandoned maybe cause i was getting too comfortable, i started to tease... Once i use my teasing and sarcastic comments to a specific person that means I like the person... Not romantically just friends... After being so hurts i realized it out... Seeking happiness from others wasn't the right choice... I started going back into my own shell and rethinking life once again..i cut off all the people i knew from the club... Cause they already viewed me as a pathetic loser already... I tried to avoid contact as much as possible... I came to realize I have problem keeping long-term friendship

In 2019... I took a break from people's bullshit and decided to be true to myself ... I finally came to realize all I needed was... Happiness came from within... Everything starts from the inside, i wasn't happy with myself for years how am I expecting other people to make me happy? I realized the main problem to cause this loneliness was me... I stopped blaming life or blame on god punishment... I started self doubt and hatred towards myself even more... I had a strong suicidal thoughts again... To avoid killing myself, i tried self care and building myself... I went looking for a job as a barista cause i love coffee but the job .. i didn't like it, my boss was emotionally manipulated, i was underpaid and overworked... Salary lesser than Uber driver... The only thing I loved about that job was drinking coffee for free lol... What i learned from my old job was understanding that everyone is different, you can't let them adapt to you, base on your own perspective, you must learn to accept other's flaws first... I was still being excluded from the staff's event party etc... Cause being myself is like this lol, everyone surely hates me cause i was really misunderstood...

In 2021 this was the peak of reaching my true self... I finally found the job I wanted... As a video editor, i was so good at it, that my boss was impressed... The first time of my life that i felt like I was doing something right... But i still hate my other boss, he is a narcissist and controlling... My anxiety relapsed cause of him... The first time I went to a therapist and was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder)... It is a hell of a living once again but at least this time I am able to control and maintain my anxiety well... I still can socialize and go to places... I was still alone anyways but i just got used to being leftout, that my emotional is numb...

2023... Ioneliness is killing me inside... I became my own worst enemy than previous years... Everyone had friends eating lunch together at work, i was still a loner, in case of dealing with lack of trust from others and afraid of being excluded and abandoned...even though i worked there for almost 2 years now all my colleagues hate me... They are all talking fun and laughing, I'm serious alone and doing my own thing... I knew it was a punishment from god... I was doomed with loneliness and finally all the bad things happened to me... I accepted my own fate... i could not change it... Currently 22s almost end my college years while doing part time jobs at the same Time... Zero friends, life full of sadness and loneliness... My whole family also doesn't understand me and they hate me as well... My mom hopes she didn't give birth to me... My big brother is the opposite of me, he's extroverted and has a life of parties... And he looked down on me...

I could not find happiness as I was supposed to... I still need people who are willing to accept me as friends... I'm insecurity about dating if the girl finds out I'm a loner, she is going to think I'm pathetically weak and loser that no one wants to be friends with... My social media has zero messages... Life is nothing to me but loneliness and emotional numbness... I do not know how to make friends anymore in this state... I'm about to give up on everything... Since like i find no peace within myself and even an impact on other people's life... My presence causes bad vibes, people wish i wasn't there... My life circle is to get up, go to work, go to school, go home, play online games alone... I hate my own existence... Everything is fucking boring and pathetic... What a fucking loser

My godawful sister ruined the family while I was in high school. Made it unliveable with the constant arguments passed midnight. 

After dropping out of college, I stayed at my awful parents house while my sister rotted in jail then prison. I did nothing for 6 months other than draw bad pictures, watch YouTube, and wish I would cease existing.

I enlisted in the military to escape. Basic training was awful because I was mentally unsound. Job training was easy. My first duty station was awful. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in beautiful Hawaii. I had no one really, so I was forced to rely on coworkers. Some were a bunch of backstabbing monsters. 

I used to breakdown and cry every 4-5 months in my barracks room late at night while watching anime. I made the mistake of telling a girl I worked with I was depressed. She tried to get me to cheat on her husband with her because her husband was cheating on her. I declined.

At my second assignment I was unable to relate to my peers, and didn't care too. Most were young kids on their 1st enlistment who wanted to drink underage and do stupid stuff. I was working on my Associates so I could actually have a job.

I hated pretty much all 5 years I was in. An awful job with poor medical care, terrible quality of life, and that awful reminder that you're just a number filling a slot on the MTOE.

The only people I talk to now are cashier's at the gas station where I buy breakfast and dinner.

Some days I just lay in bed and scroll through reddit thinking about how empty and isolating existence is. It's crushing but I lack the will to both either be crushed by or better myself.

One moment I'll be able to handle myself just fine, going about my day doing stuff and what not but then i just get smacked right in the face with just loneliness. 

It just gets progressively worse as this feeling would often get accompanied by sadness and depression. It gets to the point where i just get random headaches from my brain trying to process so many different racing thoughts. 

Thoughts on like how everyone else has somebody to talk to or simply just have a random conversation through text and what not. How other people are at the peak of their lives enjoying youth. How other people manage to maintain a best friend, heck having a group of friends. Though i do have a grp of friends i talk to but its inconsistent, since most of them are older than me and have jobs and stuff.

It doesnt help that i suffer from social anxiety, major depressive disorder and bipolarity. Its even ironic that I'm even typing this as often i would be too anxious to post remotely anything. It sucks so much as i would have to deal with so many intrusive thoughts like the urge just just punch a window or heck even smash my head onto my desk just in hopes to ease the mental processing that going on.

Yeah i am getting professional help but it only helps to a degree. In the end I'm just lonely and frankly pathetic. I never was able to maintain friend groups, i never ever gotten the experience a proper relationship (heck I'll be amaze if theres even a single soul who can tolerate a person like me). I got back stabbed and manipulated by people which made me lose someone who i thought was my best friend. They were the only person i ever sought solace in, they were part of my happy place and not to mention the only person i ever ran to when i slit my finger and bleeding out after punching my wardrobe.

I hope everyone has a great day ahead, just wanted to be heard i guess. It gets overwhelming but being through all of this shit just motivates me to help others in the same position.",1625767042.0,mental_disorder

I used to get bullied in school all the time but now that I’ve grown up (19F) I get so much attention from people & it’s weird and gross and I hate it. Boys just want to fuck me & girls are so snarky and two faced. I always thought I would’ve outgrown my weirdness & my awkwardness. I thought if I made it to 18, I would blossom into this beautiful butterfly which I guess I have physically, but mentally I’m still the same scared, wary little girl who hates opening up to people & hates herself. I would rather be alone than be around others. I’ve quite literally turned into a hermit. I don’t work or go to school and I don’t have any friends. I sit in my room all day. It’s so disheartening to feel like an outcast all the time. In high school i would try so hard to make friends but people were so mean. I never fit in at my schools, I just seem to not fit in anywhere. I have 0 concept of how to keep a friendship. I don’t text people back or anything, I really can’t hold much of a conversation, I absolutely hate social media platforms (except for reddit lol) so now I just sit here in my room and smoke weed all day. I can’t believe I’ve  become such a boring, loser, weirdo with no life and no goals.

In recent months, I’ve noticed I go through very intense highs and lows and I’m worried I have bipolar depressive disorder. I hate to self diagnose but mental health issues run rampant in my family and a few of my family members suggested I go to therapy so I can actually be diagnosed with something because it’s very clear something is wrong with me, mentally.

I feel let down by my parents to for not getting me help when i was younger when it was very clear i needed help.

I'd beg the question on why I couldn't of enjoyed my younger part of my 20's with this person that would accept me for me, why later when I'm older? Those years, you can't get back. Second fear is emotional scarring and damages. I'd hope that in any future relationship I wouldn't bring my mental and emotional baggage into it and sabotage the relationship but there is a real chance that could happen.

First of all I would like to clarify something, while I have read a lot of psychology books and have a decent amount of experience with helping people out with their emotions and problems (suicidal thoughts, depression, isolation, abusive relationships, etc.) I am NOT a qualified professional, I am NOT a therapist and I do NOT have all those years of education that therapists and psychiatrists have, not yet at least, Im still a teen.

But sometimes all that a person needs is someone to talk to, to vent to..and I can help with that, I want to help with that.

I just want somewhere to speak, knowing at least one person will read it.

Most of my life, I've been haunted by this pervasive loneliness. I have a lot of emotional trauma (nothing horrific or cinematic, like abuse or poverty, but damaging nonetheless) on top of lots of mental illnesses. Ever since I was young, I knew I was different from everyone else. Not in a quirky ""I'm not like other girls"" sorta way. Nothing I could concentrate down into a specific trait or behavior. But I've never felt I truly belonged anywhere. I know now that I'm older that these differences can most likely be attributed to my adhd and probably undiagnosed autism as well. 

I've always felt misunderstood. Which is another common cliché. But it runs deep inside of me. I suppose misunderstood isn't quite right. Its more that I don't feel anyone understands me at all - an important distinction.  Before, I used to be unapologetically me. For better, or, more often, for worse. But people can't handle unbridled depression. It makes them feel hopeless. Bad. So they pushed me away. They couldn't handle hearing how much I suffered, or my mood swings. 

Now I hide it. My illnesses, my interests - things other people can't relate to or understand or handle. I'm not making up versions of myself for others, but instead only showing them certain parts of me. Hiding the rest, like a watered down version of myself. 

This makes all of the relationships I form feel empty and hollow. Fake and unsatisfying. It feels like there's this giant hole in my chest when I accidentally start thinking about how lonely I am.

I feel selfish and guilty because I do have some friends and family who I know care, some who say they love me. But it doesn't help at all. Because I know what they love isn't really me - just the version of me they want to see. The one they can handle and tolerate. 

Some people say I should just stop masking. But I know what it's like not to mask. People don't like that me. They can't handle my true feelings, my moods, my dark thoughts. 

Other people say I need to save it for a therapist. But I've tried tons of therapists and therapy techniques. They help a little bit, but then I hit a ceiling. I don't connect with the therapist. The usual shit doesn't work on me. I know more than they do just from years of experience and different therapists. Eventually, the therapeutic relationship breaks down until I call it off altogether.

So I don't talk to anyone about how i feel. But it fucking hurts, keeping it in. I want attention. Love. To feel seen and heard and understood. But I don't feel it at all. I haven't for years. Maybe my whole life. And it's fucking killing me. Without love, life feels so empty and pointless. Why spend all this time trying to be successful and have money and do shit just so I can come home to loneliness? Why am I struggling to survive in misery?

I'm only 23. People tell me to just wait - the right person will come along. They started telling me to wait at 13. Fuck, I'm so tired of being told that. As if my ability to feel loved and whole is completely out of my hands. I just have to submit to the will of fate and life. 

This is where people say I should love myself. Which, sure, is important, something I constantly work on and have made progress in. But it only takes me so far. Eventually, I need social interaction. I need validation and love from peers and friends and family - everyone needs some. It doesn't make me weak or bad or wrong to crave and need it - it's human nature to be social and to want to feel accepted. 

I try to go out and meet others, but it usually makes me feel worse. Another cliche, but I'm pretty empathic, good at reading body language and understanding others. Not that I'm always right or a mind reader, but I know I'm talented. It's easy for me to walk into a social situation and scope potential friends. It's such a let down to know almost immediately that there are no potential candidates. Not that I have super high criteria (I think), just that most people wouldn't be able to handle me as a close friend the way I want.

I'm like an exotic animal. High maintenance, lots of specialized needs. Require special training and certification to handle. People with no experience with mental illness can easily be checked off. People with too busy of lives can also usually be excluded. And most people at my college already have close friends, and don't really feel the need to make new ones. So that already hacks away most of the friend pool. 

Tonight is the first meeting for one of my clubs - mock trial. I really enjoy it as an activity. But going sometimes gets me down because I can feel so tangibly how much of an outsider I am. There's friend groups in the club already - and I'm not a part of any of them. It's a constant reminder of how lonely I am. 

I try my best to go to group outings and activities and such. But always feeling like I'm on the outside makes it really hard. I also have chronic energy issues due to mental illness and an autoimmune disorder. Not to make myself a sob story or anything, but it just makes it hard for me to constantly be doing shit. I wish I could drown my loneliness in activities and shit all day like other people do. Be cool and aloof like movie characters, focused on my career and myself, suppressing my feelings until ""the one"" comes along. But I can't. My energy limits me. 

And so I spend time laying down, left with my thoughts, and the feelings are too colossal and powerful to ignore, breaking me down for hours at a time in depressive episodes. I wish it was numbness, but it's not. It's white hot agony. The loneliness is so devastating and crushing, it feels like my body is imploding in on itself. Grief is not gentle - it's wretched and all consuming, tearing through my insides and making my muscles spasm from the searing firework bursts of emotional blisters. It makes me want to self harm - not out of punishment or self hate or to feel good or better, but just so my outside can match my inside. So I can rip and bleed the pain out of me. I never do, but I feel the urge every time. 

I gave that brief description in a vain hope that someone will understand. That what I feel is so extreme and torturous, something that's beaten me down again and again over so many years that I can barely remember what it's like to be without it. This loneliness. 

I don't know what to do. I'm trying my absolute best - have made progress in lots of personal goals - but none of it is ever enough. I am afraid this emptiness will plague me for the rest of my life. I'm not suicidal, but it makes me wonder if this life is worth living. If I truly cannot be cured, why live in misery? Why torture myself to try so hard, to reach such lofty heights, when in the end, none of my achievements will ever fill this loneliness? Why am I trying so hard to better myself, to have a successful career, to do all of these things, if none of this will change the end result - that I will be unhappy and alone.",1662666376.0,mental_disorder
223,2952.0,Fear of Love Phobia – Philophobia,5,c7k7un,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/c7k7un/fear_of_love_phobia_philophobia/,1,"Philophobia is the fear of love or of becoming emotionally connected with another person. It shares many of the same traits as other specific phobias, particularly those that are social in nature. And it can significantly impact your life.

**Philophobia** isn't social **anxiety** disorder, although people with **philophobia** may also have social **anxiety** disorder. Social **anxiety** disorder causes extreme fear in social situations, but it's different from **philophobia** because it encompasses a number of social contexts.

how it happened,how it has affected me and how I deal with it (spoilers,I don’t),now I believe this phobia triggered after my first ever relationship ended,I was 14 years old,at first it didn’t really affect me that much,sure I was upset and depressed about it but I didn’t develop an instant phobia,at least I think,maybe the phobia gradually increased as the months went by…I got teased a lot by my classmates,telling me that its all my fault,saying that I was a bad boyfriend and she didn’t see me anything more than a timepass,and things like that…so I think that if the teasing wasn’t that started the phobia then that was certainly the catalyst to the growth of my phobia,and no I don’t hate them for doing what they did,we were all dumb young teenagers…sure they could have thought about how it might affect me, but most teens don’t really think that much when they have the sudden urge to say or do something ,especially when they are around their friends .So no, I don’t hate them or anything,Shit just happens,we just gotta move on…now after my phobia had taken control…which took a few months to happen I guess…my “love life” has become non-existent ,as well as my sexual life which is tied to my love life…is sexual life tied to love life? Idk ,anyway because of my phobia I legit cant even look at a girl let alone speak to one,and whenever that rare moment happens when I start catching some feeling for a girl,my anxiety starts throwing a party inside me,the feeling of liking someone and then trying your damn best to delete your feelings and forget about the existence of that someone...is horrible…and after i've done it,after I got defeated by philophobia like the 3 other times…I feel empty again,its so hard for me to even find someone to like and then having to instantly dislike that someone…it makes me feel…dead.Now as to how I cope with I..as I told you before..i don’t.i just cant,it has already consumed me.Now you could tell to go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist but..there are no professional psychologists in my country and the few psychiatrists that this country has...well you could compare them to the 1950’s psychiatrists that lived in the USA,because mental health is a very new concept in my country.  

The reason I wrote is because I wanted to let it out of my chest, so that you guys know that you are not the only ones suffering from this issue,and im surprised that this issue hasn’t ever been brought up before,not as much as im covering it right now anyway,and also so that other people who are not struggling with this issue know that people like us exist ,so if you know someone you care about who you think might have this issue then try talking to them about it,im not sure if they’ll open up but it’s a good starting point,they will at least know that you know about it and that you gave a shit,and knowing that will make their day much better,even if they don’t show it to you,trust me…..i’d know.

224,2955.0,why am I alone in my head?,4,wbmdbq,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/wbmdbq/why_am_i_alone_in_my_head/,0,"I was recently given the idea that I may have trauma from my childhood. I always think people are making fun of my. I do have night terrors and sometimes scream in my sleep. I always try avoiding people because I am afraid of what they'll say to me. I am always on edge around others and intimidated by them as well.

More about me that could relate to my ptsd. I laugh at other people's reaction when I insult them. Not in a way to be mean but in a way to just feel comfortable and feel like I can be on their level. I believe this has something to do with the fact that I still experience people laughing at me when I was a child and how funny they viewed my reaction which in turn has me develop that kind of humor.

I believe I have an underdeveloped mind. I still watch cartoons to this day. I have never dated anyone. I am really not into porn. I am not asexual because I still find female attractive. All that points me in a direction that I may have an underdeveloped mind.

Other things I do that relate to my trauma is depression. I feel very isolated and alone from everyone else in society. I have terrible facial expression along with awkward positioning when I walk. When I was younger I wasn't always like that. I was a very cheery lad as a kid until my ocd and adhd started to get in the way of my social life

I feel really intimidated when I see other people talk to me. I am scared of what they may say to me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. When someone does insult me I react in a very scared way that makes it fun for them to insult me. They see how easy it is to insult me and they continually make fun of me getting in my head. It is hard for me to say anything back to them because I have a very bad time communicating my thoughts. 

I cling onto friends real easily. Everytime I lose a close relation with friends I tend to feel even more isolated then I already do. In the end I really care what they think of me. In this internship I tend to always go out of my way to help my superiors so they can accept me.

 I always had the idea that I am a super hero that can defeat anyone. This image of myself being one started in 6th grade and it continues to this day. I'd imagine myself being like that when I listen to music. This kind of imagine gives me the belief that I am superior to everyone else but when reality is being faced in front of me all, that feeling goes quickly away.

For the first time ever I meant somebody else who had adhd and ocd but didn't show any kind of issues expressing themselves through their face. They could speak perfectly fine and I could see they were very confident in their words. They do enjoy being around others and don't have any issue with conversation. This has led me to a conclusion that I have something other then ad/ocd and I believe it might be ptsd.

More information that might help answerthis question! 

I am currently working at a company  and I majoring in management information systems or business analyst I have 2 siblings with my brother becoming a freshman in college and my sister is going into the 8th grade. Both my parents are very loving and caring. My mother is a business owner and my dad is not working because of his heart which he is currently on disabilities for. 

I have seen therapist in the past, I stopped because I thought that I didn't need it after I graduated from high school. Once I did hit half way through my freshman year I wanted to see a counselor on campus which she did help in some capacity but I eventually did stop seeing her. I started seeing another counselor on campus two weeks ago but I wanted more help so I wanted to try betterhelp and give it a try. I learned that my mindset is not set in stone as in I can change who I am. Before I started seeing my counselor. I believed that my adhd and ocd were things that I could not change. She has taught me that I can change who I am. She introduced mindfulness and mediation which got me to believe that I can improve or in other words get better with dealing with my adhd/ocd. I stopped doing both of those because they were not in my interest but I still am trying to figure out other ways to improve myself. 
While I was doing this internship I believed I was not going to perform well because of my disorders. As time has went on however, I started to realized that the main issue was not my disorders but my self esteem.
My motivation has been through my work ethic. When I was younger was made fun of a lot by my peers from being different from them as in not being as good enough to enjoy a conversation with them. In middle school I specifically remember that every 2-3 months I would no longer be welcomed by others I sat with who I thought were my friends. In high school it got better but I started feeling lonely and still do. In high school I vouched to myself that I would prove them wrong by getting a good job so people could look up to me which has made my life good and bad in some ways. The good thing is it has got me to work really hard in college and I enjoy doing work because I feel part of something. The bad being that this kind of mindset has got me to think that people are always out to get me.

I take medication which is 125 mg of stetraline which my docter wants me to start taking 200 mg soon, 40mg of atomoxetine, 25mg of adderall, and trazodone.

One thing I  often do is getting sidetracked easily. When I am giving a task it is easy for me to get distracted and do something else which becomes an obsessive thought from my ocd and my adhd. I will then make the obsessive thought a thing I will hyberfocus onto which in turn makes me be in the clouds a lot.

 Another issue I tend to do commonly is I commonly have a hard time paying attention in certain situations which in turn makes it hard for me to pay attention when someone is giving me instructions.

Conclusion!

Do I have complex ptsd? What other kind of disorders/mental health issues could I possibly have. I am seeing a therapist within less then a month but the more information I get from people the better I get. Thank you for reading down this far and I look forward to reading any comments you post.

My oldest memories are of being afraid that my father would kill me due  to his mental disorder.Ive been homeless on and off since i was 6 years old. I have siblings but due to their own traumas and my own and being alone for so long i'm unable to connect I have four sisters and all where victims of childhood rape.They filed a report their rapist still walk free. My mother and father still go to the church that is led by the pastor that covered up their rapes and whose children have preyed on the church children.Whats worse is my nephews and nieces are exposed at this church to their aunts rapist and due to some sick belief in god their parents think its norma.I found someone who was starting to fall for me after i fell for her but someone decided to falsely accuse me of being a child  predator for some reason and started to spread the rumor but its not true due to the fact that i was victimized myself by an older woman when i was young i wont go into detail but the choice was die on the streets that winter or go home with her due to these experiences and a few more i wont post  i could never harm anyone woman or child  in that manner i was actually stabbed for stopping a rape before.well now the few friends i had stopped talking to me .Some conversations i had that where private where taken out of context and used to misrepresent me along with those false accusations.I have had to do many things i'm not proud of to survive.But the honest truth is that all i've ever wanted was to help others.I want to be a doctor and help heal others.I like poetry and art philosophy.I don't drink or do drugs because i believe that every moment is precious that people have the capacity for greatness To be honest i want to love and be loved to have a somewhere safe to sleep where people wont hurt me for just existing i cant imagine a place where i'm safe or not wondering where my next meal will come from every moment that passes is difficult because the world views me as a monster and in many ways i hurt because of its view and  treatment of me.The truth is that home is something ill never know being loved is unimaginable not being surrounded by monsters is so foreign everybody around me has been a monster but to be honest the worst monsters are normal people because even theo i survive in alleys i can understand why the people out here try to hurt me its a fight for resources whether it be food money or drugs.However people in conventional society they make false accusations or hunt me like an animal because i'm homeless they actually stabbed me for fun.Its difficult because i just want to go home i just want to be safe i just want to be not hungry i just want her to be there and to hold my hand all  i know is i'm running to the military in search of a better life.The truth is i'm likely going to die far away from this place surrounded by strangers and it'll be the closes to a home i'll have ever known i don't know why i'm typing this i don't think it will change anything if your reading this theo know this we most likely will never meet, hold each other,  or laugh together but  i sincerely hope that you find home even if i never do.",1592384953.0,mental_disorder
226,2963.0,I'm all alone and I need someone to talk to,7,mgpxu5,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/mgpxu5/im_all_alone_and_i_need_someone_to_talk_to/,5," 

First off if you have anything to say at all please don't hesitate to make a comment I'd love to hear other people's responses. I feel like I am truly alone and this isn't a recent feeling with the pandemic I've felt this way for years. I just feel different from everyone. There are three main aspects of my life that make me feel this way.

The first aspect is my friendships. I've never been friendless but I've never had more than 5 or so friends at any given time. Right now I only have 3 real friends that I actually see on a somewhat regular basis. I was apart of a different friend group but I realized I was the least valued member in that group. So I did a little experiment since I noticed it was always me hitting them up and trying to get invited to their gatherings I texting them to see if they would text me first. They didn't and that was all the proof I needed so I just dropped them. Anyway that's happened a lot where I'm the least valued member of a friend group.

The second aspect is my family. Next thing is my family. I moved to Southern California when I was three and have been living here ever since. I'm 20 right now for reference. Anyway I was originally born in Northern California and that's where all my family lives besides my parents. While I am close to my cousins that do live up there I only see them one or maybe twice a year if I'm lucky. Also it is important to note that I don't have any siblings, I'm an only child. Other than my parents I have no family that lives around me so growing up it was never like ""let's go to grandma's house."" When it comes to my parents they were never mean or abusive. I can count the amount of times they beat me on one hand. But they never really went out pf their way to try and make sure I was ok. Whenever I try to talk to my parents about my feelings it never goes well. My mother immigrated from the Middle East so I am half Arab. In Middle Eastern culture people with mental disorders are seen as trash and they are never offered real help. Just one of the many reasons why I hate my culture but that's a whole different rant. So it never goes well when I talk to her as for my dad he just doesn't really understand either. He's better than my mom as he at least tries to help but often what he says hurts more than helps as he says things like ""get over yourself"" and ""quit complaining your not crippled and don't have cancer."" Comments like these don't help because he doesn't know what it's like for me and he doesn't try to step into my shoes.

The third aspect is the lack of romantic relationships in my life. I'm just gonna say it I'm 20 years old and I haven't had a girlfriend a single day in my life. The farthest I've gone is making out with a girl in 2016 at a party only because of a dare. She didn't even want to make out with me, she liked someone else at the time. I've never even held a girl's hand. I don't have problems making friends with girls in fact 2 out of the 3 friends I mentioned earlier are girls but I just don't know what's wrong. I've never had a girl come up to me to start a conversation, I've never had a girl compliment me, and there has never been a girl to show even any remote signs of interest in me. I'm not the best looking guy in the world but I'm not fat, I shower and clean myself, and I go for hikes almost every day to keep in shape. It just makes me think ""what's wrong with me"" and ""I'm not good enough and I'm worthless in the eyes of girls."" It just pains me to see other people whether they be my friends, family, or random people in relationships while I'm starving for attention. I just want that kind of connection with someone. I just want someone to come home to and listen to how my day was. I want someone who I could share anything with. I just want to experience what it's like to have that kind of deep connection with another. I'm still only 20 so I know I'm young but with how my mental state is now it's only going to get worse in the coming years if I can't find a girl. I predict if things don't change I'm probably going to hit my breaking point around age 25. At that point I really fear that I will do something brash and seriously hurt myself or others. In other words I am scared of myself cause there is only so much loneliness the human mind can take before it reaches a point of true insanity. Humans are social creatures after all nobody is truly independent we need each other.

However there is light at the end of the tunnel. I am transferring out of my community college and moving into a real university this fall. I did get accepted to my local university but I chose to go one that is about a 4 hour drive away from where I live now. Mainly because I feel like I have nothing left for me in this city and I want to view this as a fresh start. Once I go there I will forget everything that's happened in the past and only try to focus on the future. I hope I'm able to find some new people because if I don't and I stay alone then I don't know how long I'd be able to live like this.

Thank you to whoever read the whole thing and even more thanks if you left a comment.

TL:DR - I have felt lonely my entire life this boils down to three aspects of my life. The first is lack of friends. I only have three real friends right now and have never had more than around 5. Second is family. I don't have any siblings and other than my parents no family lives in my city. It has been this way my whole life. Third is lack of romantic relationships, I've never had a girlfriend and that brings me deep sadness and loneliness. I just want to experience that kind of connection you get when your in a relationship with another person.",1617138137.0,mental_disorder
227,2971.0,I dont feel accepted because of my autism. The world just feels really hostile to me,22,hczehf,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/hczehf/i_dont_feel_accepted_because_of_my_autism_the/,10," 

Throughout most of my life I’ve only been comfortable talking and being around my mom, dad, sister and therapist that I see. I only had one friend early on in my life from kindergarten (2005) to about 6th grade (2011) when we drifted off. From then on to today i've been alone because i'm very anxious/nervous around people and do not feel accepted or comfortable around people due to my mental disorder.(ill get to that soon)

I was a very quiet person when I was younger. My parents and teachers were concerned with me since I never talked in school. I would only talk in front of my parents, sister and friend. I wouldn’t even talk in front of other family members such as my cousins, aunt and grandparents. For some reason letting other people hear my voice felt very scary. I did not understand I had a problem. I was happy with my only friend and viewed not talking as normal.Obviously it was not normal and something was going on. Looking back on it now I was very scared, uncomfortable and anxious around people/strangers but it became normal and felt normal to me when I was very young. 

In elementary school I wouldn’t talk and did not like talking in front of students. When I say that I mean I would not say a word at school. I was known by students for being quiet and not talking. I was mute for everyone everyday until the last year or so of elementary when I got more comfortable responding to questions my teachers had. By middle school I was able to respond to people when asked something but I would still not voluntarily say anything or talk to people. I was still very uncomfortable and anxious. People had always known me as the person who did not talk. My friend even joked that if i did not start talking they would put me in the special ed class.

My friend and I sort of drifted off in 6th grade and the next school year something between us happened and we just forgot about each other. I was already alone most of the time growing up but from that point onward I would move into the situation that I am still in today. In 8th grade I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by a psychologist from the county. More specifically the Aspergers type. The diagnosis explained a lot to my teachers and parents. The next year I started a program for kids with mental disorders at a high school a bit further away then the school I would’ve gone to if I wasn’t put in the program. It wasn’t any different from what they taught in normal classes. It was basically smaller class sizes. I felt more comfortable in these classes but we did have to take electives with the mainstream students. At first nothing much changed in high school from middle school. Still just as uncomfortable and anxious around people as before but during the last 2 years or so I started to really want to have people to talk to and do stuff with, like friends. I think I’ve always wanted friends even in middle school but I just never acknowledged it upfront or paid attention to it. 

Its now been 2 years since i graduated in may of 2018 and nothing has changed, even with my new therapist i started seeing in the spring of 2018. All these years we've been talking about the same thing. Ive been stuck for so long. There has been other things weve talked about and things that were previously uncomfortable for me to share and tell him. For the most part though weve made no progress with the main issue of making social connections. 

Ive just always been terrified of people. I only feel safe speaking and acting out around my immediate family. In fact I’ve always had this view or feeling of the world where my mom, dad, sister and me are one unit and then everyone else i encounter in my life or have yet encountered or just exist in the world feel like strangers or foreigners to me. Like I’m comfortable in the house my mom, sister and me live in but when I venture out into the world with them it’s like I’m stepping out to outer space or to a foreign country. All my interactions with people are so uncomfortable. I’m scared to approach them or speak to them. When I am out in the world and I do have to talk my heart beat goes up, I start sweating and I start panicking internally like it’s the end of the world. When I talk my voice is very low and it sounds very different from when I talk to my mom, dad or sister. It has this very mundane neutral tone. Sometimes I even try to change the way it sounds around strangers to something that sounds like what I use with my parents and sister but it never works. It just stays the same. It’s really frustrating cause I come off as more innocent or disabled when I sound like that. A lot of times I don’t know what to say or reply when people who aren’t my parents talk to me. No matter how much I try to act myself, my personality completely changes when I’m around other people. It’s like my brain reverts to a really primitive state where my voice has no emotion, I’m really scared, quiet and want to leave. I just can't express myself. 

In situations where I have talked to people it’s never gone well. Like one time I was talking to a volunteer staff person at a wolf sanctuary in PA my dad and I visit often. He was actually the one who started talking to her asking questions about the wolves there but I had been wanting to test out my speaking skills all day so I chimed in and asked about the coyotes in the area. I stuttered and stumbled over my words when I spoke. I tried to control my voice but didn’t know how, all my brain was doing was putting another word in front of the other while retrieving thoughts. This always happens, my brain just detonates and malfunctions when talking to someone I don’t know. The most humiliating part about that experience in particular is how the volunteer staff person responded to me. She treated me differently than when she responded to my dad. Her voice had changed to a soft spoken one and her answer to my question was noticeably simpler. This happens a lot actually...

Like when I interact with people whether it be in a class, internship or i'm just ordering food at subway people treat me and talk to me like i'm a little kid in a baby voice. I hate it. I just want to be treated and talked to the way they would talk to another person who is 20. People have always treated me this way as if im more innocent or dont know the things I would at my age. It makes me feel even more alienated and left out of the social environment for young adults. I've completed high school and am in a community college. I have the same goals for success and wants as anyone my age would have. I don't know exactly what it is. Is it my timidness? Voice? My aversion to eye contact? Maybe it's my 5,4 height that makes people think I'm way younger than I am. I guess it could be a combo of all.

To sum everything up I just don't feel accepted based on the experiences I've had. I'm also very very afraid of people to the point where it's as if its a natural instinct. Its always been that way and the severity of it has gotten worse over time. I feel like those two things have caused me to miss out on a lot of things/interests. Theres  been this interest ive had but never really felt connected to the community for it. I've always just been this spectator for almost a decade around it. It actually took me like 10 therapy sessions of alluding to it to my therapist to actually tell him. This interest is furries. Okay this part goes a bit off topic but i just wanted to explain why to clear up a bit things since this fandom is infamous for being controversial. 

My affinity for animal characters goes way back to when I was much younger. In fact I was into a specific type of anthropomorphic character that would be known today as a feral. This all started when I was very young, around 4 or 5. I had a big interest for cats and dogs. Particularly seeing them in movies. I liked watching movies like all dogs go to heaven and the 2 homeward bound movies from the 90s. I developed an affinity for canine characters in particular to where I became obsessed with them. Characters being dogs just felt more natural and aesthetically attractive. In fact when I was around 7 or 8 I started to come up with these stories in my head that would have dogs as characters. I’d imagine what happens in one episode/storyline and I would play it in my head as I came up with stuff while in bed at night. I’d imagine all of it in 2d animation. This is one of those weird things I did people may find off putting about me. Anyways i started doing this in 2008 when I was about 8 and it continued consistently until about 2012. I sort of forgot about it then as I had different interests coming in. Later in 2012 I found the Anthro/Fursuit part of the furry community. I've watched from the sidelines since.

Anyways i feel like i've missed a lot of things. My fear of people kept me from doing anything. 

Now I’m 20 and I don’t know how people act at this age or do for fun. That thought alone causes me anxiety, stress and sadness. I’ve grown up and everything but despite graduating, going to a community college and looking for jobs I still feel 7 years younger. I only have experience talking to my parents and the last time I talked regularly with someone my own age was in mid 2011. I never had someone my own age as a friend in the past 9 years to talk to. On top of this I don’t know what people my age casually do for fun. The things I do see people do scare me. Even the way I hear people talk intimidates me. It's just all shouting, unrestrained and rambunctious. Meanwhile I'm quiet and when I do talk or laugh it's a low voice and my personality is generally the opposite of the way I described the people i'm afraid of. Whenever I'm approached by one one these people and respond, they're thrown off by my calm and mundane response. I'm even afraid of how big or tall people my age are. The last time i had a friend most people were around my height and i kinda stopped growing at 5’4 and now that i'm 20 it's so jarring to see all these people who are almost 6’0. Like i can't believe I'm in the same age group as them.

I know I’m 20 and I still got a lot of time. But for the longest time I’ve been stuck where I am socially for years and have not gotten less afraid or improved mentally a bit in that time span.  More recently I’ve been stuck the past year or so talking about the same things with my therapist. This January I just gave up but I still don’t want it to be that way. I’ve seen posts from other people on reddit who are in their 40s and still haven’t made any friends. I’m stuck right now and I could very well end up like that. 

I have seen people recommend using discord or twitter to meet new people but I have just as a hard time connecting to people on there as I do in real life. A lot of times I don’t know what to say like irl. And like i want to say more then just a few words to show people that I’m interested and care about what they’re saying but all that comes out of me is “ok, nice, yes, oh cool, oh”. It’s frustrating. I mean I’ll say almost the same thing irl audibly of course but I feel irl I can be a bit more flexible despite my limited vocabulary when approached by strangers. Typing messages online limits so much emotion for all people and misunderstandings can occur as a result. Last year in June I ran into this problem. Long story short, it ended with people bullying me on discord and a Minecraft server. I actually cried irl when trying to tell a discord admin what happened. From then on I decided that if I were ever to pursue a friendship or connection it’d be in person not online. 

Recently i've sort of reversed my decision but have run into the same problems as before. My therapist actually encouraged me to find a group related to my furry interest but I was already in one anyway and have been encountering the same problems. Such as being very atypical and awkward to the point of people treating me different, getting very confused, ignoring me and even getting mad at me. I try to be myself but im just so incompatible with the way most people talk and think and interpret things, process things. I take things literally, don't understand sarcasm, humor and social cues. A lot of times i just talk so formal and i hate it but its the only way i know how to talk, Formal as if i was at an interview. Worse part in the whole discord idea was being bullied off a server when people knew something was up with me. Saying i reeked of autism. I just cant take it. I try to join conversations but am usually met with some level of aggression and when I try to start them im ignored or they just end very quickly. It took months for me to actually talk in new groups and try to get past anxiety. Almost every time things take a turn for the worst and i'm left scarred from those experiences and even more afraid to speak.

I don't know why but last December i thought something would happen. Maybe where I finally get more involved in the furry community. The month just went on and passed though. Then January, February and spring. We're now two thirds through June.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I'm exhausted, sad and have just lost all hope for connecting to people and living a normal life for someone my age. Like i mentioned before I have been trying to get more involved in the furry community but haven't had too much luck as you can see. Though on top of that the community has always terrified me a bit. The whole furry thing has grown exponentially the last few years and it seems like a huge social jungle when I see furry social media, pages, groups, pics of cons etc.

Anyways the way my ASD affects the way I think and act combined with my severe social anxiety just gets in the way of everything in my life. My interactions with people end up weird and even creepy and end up with people trying to get away from me or treating/speaking to me like I’m a little kid and not a 20 year old adult. That last thing is so confusing for me and another huge issue in itself. I’m just too different in the way I think and act as an anti social repellent. This world just isn’t really for me. I was born with ASD and grew up terribly afraid of people, feeling inferior and different. I’ve felt alienated from society based on the experiences I’ve had. Now I just have no hope. For me, meeting people, connecting and talking would be as likely as winning a billion dollars. It just feels impossible at this point. I’m incapable of forming relationships with other people besides my parents. I’ve always been that way. All I want is someone to talk to, maybe help me with my creative work and share ideas. I'm just too incompatible though. I just feel so trapped by my circumstances and that I may never break through to the world.

Recently I confessed to my therapist that I wanted to jump off an overpass onto a 12 lane interstate near me. Everything i've tried has not worked. All the online stuff i was suggested by my therapist and job coaches has not worked. I wanted to be happy but the human society/culture has rejected me. The world is so hostile, more then i thought. No one takes the time to understand you or realize you have feelings and are capable of being hurt badly. The only social contact I've had the past decade has been my parents and sister. It hurts so bad that I've had enough. Looking ahead to the 2020s my life will just be filled sadness, depression, loneliness, existential crises and will just be a generally painful experience mentally. 

I'm looking through a journal I wrote near the end of march. Ive gotten worse since. Every year it's the same thing since I graduated in may 2018. I'm alone in this universe. All I wanted was a friend I could talk to. I like drawing feral dogs and wolves. Making stories for them. That's it. Most of my posts on reddit go unnoticed and when someone does respond through dms… they go away eventually… and i'm alone again, in the void of the universe.

I dont know what im even going to do after this post. I dont want to be lonely but thats probably what awaits me. :(",1592707982.0,mental_disorder

Sometimes you can deal with it and then the next minute you're sad as shit with no hope. It's just all I'd need is a hug or something, ya know? Social Anxiety has well and truly destroyed me as a person and has taken my life. Any enjoyment I used to have has been taken from me and It's just so sad because I know there's so much to enjoy in life but, I can't go and get it because of my mental issue. You try and get help but all they do is diagnose you and drug you. I'm tired of living like this, I'm tired of living in a cell, locked by my own thoughts and feelings. It's made me a terrible person and such a mean and dark soul but, behind that I'm such a soft guy but, after not having love and just someone to lean back onto the feeling of love becomes completely alien to you. I don't even know what it's like to be truly loved, that feeling of LOVE is something I've never been able to experience because, I have been trapped in my house for the past 4-5 years and I'm only 16. I'm not even able to enjoy doing things that normal teenagers do and I've forced myself to grow up and it makes you wanna just end it. I love everyone deep down but, my issues just make me seem like I wanna be an aggressive little asshole. People who are upset and vent out at people calling them the worst things and trying to make them sad is pure projection and it's a way of earning attention. When you're so lonely for so long and you become deprived of just a hug or a hello it turns you into a sour person and you'll do anything to get a bit of attention. Sometimes you do wanna just fly above the sky and break free you know what I mean? Sometimes life is a bitch but, there's life being a bitch and then there's life being a stone cold bitch for years on end. I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy. It's hard to even sleep at times because you know that when you wake up it's just the same cycle. You wake up, do nothing for most of the day and then sleep. But, I don't want that, I wanna escape, go to a mountain and just scream because I've piled everything on top of each other for AGES and after a while you can only hold so much before it bursts out. I know that people become lonely after a break-up but, I can't relate at all as I said before I've never even felt love, I've definitely liked a girl but never got anywhere with it. I don't even know why I got this fucked up disorder it seems like something just switched inside me and I was destined to be lonely for life, I honestly might as well be locked up on death row. Sorry for the long post, but I could write forever. Thank you if you read the entire thing I wish you the best in life. Good Luck.",1585713992.0,mental_disorder
229,2974.0,20f: ever since I was hospitalized as a teenager I've had no social life,14,5j4sew,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/5j4sew/20f_ever_since_i_was_hospitalized_as_a_teenager/,3,"Hi all. Not sure why I'm even bothering to post here. I'm so far gone that I don't know if anything can help me feel better, but I've always chickened out to posting on Reddit for fear of being judged... if not just due to laziness. 

So here I am. When I was 16 I was hospitalized in and out for about 18 months due to an eating disorder. Before then I was a high achiever who was mostly secluded, but had a close friend or two that I spent time with. When my ED got to be a problem, I was taken out of school for all of my junior year. I don't know how to explain it, but after having most of my dignity taken from me in mental wards... left me a totally different person. I wanted nothing to do with my past life or anything that reminded me of what I was before I got sick. I deleted all social media and basically cut ties with the few friends I had. 

My senior year I transferred to a new school. I swear that for the entire 5 months I attended, I didn't speak to anyone for any other reason except discussing schoolwork. I had no idea how to make friends as the only friends I had for the past year or so I met in the hospital where the relationship dynamic was totally different. 

Feeling totally depressed and like an outsider, I dropped out of my classes and went to online school for the remainder of my high school career. Things got better when I met my current SO via an online dating website. He is the only friend I have, but I'm still feeling like I'm missing a platonic friendship. I need another relationship in my life to balance things out a little more. I don't want to feel so hopelessly dependent on my SO for everything. 

I've tried to reconnect with friends from my past, but find myself uninterested or too anxious to go after any actual friendship and I just end up not talking to these people again and giving off the vibe that I don't want any social interaction. 

But I do want friends. I am 20 and I have no fucking friends from school or clubs or anything. It's like for my whole childhood and adolescence I knew no one and was known by no one. I've made people think I don't like them because I'm too awkward to interact and come off like a bitch. 

Idk what I'm hoping for here. I just have no one to talk to right now. Thanks for reading. ",1482126397.0,mental_disorder

Ill be wasting their time anyway. It's hard being in public and not having anyone to laugh with and share secrets with or just anyone by my side. Then again i'm an introvert so I perfer to stay indoors but thats besides the point. It's just too hard to be myself because I'm the one who wants to feel love and get love and give love, but I was smart enough to stop myself from giving into peer pressure and toxic people. Yet still feeling empty inside could be worse than at least having someone there even if they are a brainless prick. But it's too late to change my mind. Instead I get to watch all these jocks and stuck-ups and wannabe gangsters and soldiers get all the praise and not even appreciate it. Fuck that. Fuck them. Sometimes I decide to be myself until the day I borrow Kurt Cobain's microphone or die of old age or even die of a brain aneurysm in the middle of the night so I wont have to endure the pain of my untimely demise. Despite the hard facts I face almost everyday, I have heard from my family and a few of my friends that I guess I'm really smart guy, maybe I was a little funny and had a few unique things about me, but no one would want to invest the time to find out those things or even listen to me talk about my personal projects and ideas. Being ignored to the bone and an outcast to everyone, especially by my own blood, creates a terrible amount of depression that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. It also feels like every time I want to make friends I just get momentary praise or I get dragged along by someone so they won't damage their social status or ego. Fuck that. I'm also tired of people saying that they have it way worse than me. It makes me believe i'm not allowed to be sad. Like I don't deserve to feel depressed, which is very meta and I dont know what to say to that. I remember back to some of my friends that I had where I would talk with them and do favors for them and when I asked if they wanted to hang out, the reply would always be ""Oh sorry. I'm busy."" or something like that. And the only thing you could reply to that was ""Oh ok. Sorry"" because if you even dared to question why they always reject your invitations, you can consider yourself dead to them. This whole life that I live is just a cycle of dullness that will never be cleaned, like a rust spot on a piece of a car that wont go away. And yet my cousins have such better lives than me and i'm not too far from their age. One is living with her german gamer boyfriend and their all hunky dory in love. One is  an aspiring abstract artist. One is a body builder that actually got signed by a fucking company. One is still in ASU but has a network of friends and plays Steam games with them when not at school. But I guess I wasnt born under the right circumstances to be a successful person. At best I'll be some coder or game designer that comes home late to a wife struggling with some mental disorder and a kid going through the same perils I'm going through right now. Its just hard not to think about suicide nowadays when everyone you know has much better and busier lives than you and your left with a community of hood rats and scumbags that all want something out of you. Its hard to find real friends and have someone to talk to and vent to and get support when I'm having a bad day. Not even one person to share a singular deep thought with. Even though I dont want to change for people, I hate who I have become. I dont know if being dumb makes me smart or being smart makes me dumb. I remember a lot of stupid shit ive done pretty often. It races around my brain like an earworm and it just cant be ignored. Believe me I've tried. Some days I just want to straight up die. I'm fascinated by existentialism. What does it really feel like to die? To eat a bullet, to burn to death, to fall face first onto hard pavement. And afterwards, do we go anywhere? Heaven? Hell? Afterlife? Ascension? Are there any gods to answer my questions? Anyone out there in the great unknown? I guess I'll never know. And I dont want to know. My life is for a very lonely soul, but I know I don't really want to die. I just want the pain to end. But it never will end, even if I try. So I dont know what to do anymore. Maybe one day I'll get lucky and be diagnosed with cancer or some other life ending disease, because then I wouldnt have to worry about if I want to be alive next week. I'll get an expiration date. I know fully fucking well that I dont have it the worst, but it dosent change the fact my only source of community are suicide hotlines. I need help. I don't know how I'll get help, but I need help. I don't care to text someone either. I want to hear someones voice. I want to see someone's smile. I want to hug someone as they hug me back. I'm willing to do anything at all for even just one person to adore the shit out of me. But no. All I get to be is  a l o n e",1570718865.0,mental_disorder

I have no IRL friends, and someone I was talking to regularly on reddit for months has suddenly stopped responding. Weekends have been bad for me for a while, but lately they're getting worse. I take medication for depression, but it's not keeping the clouds away.  I can muddle through the week because I'm surrounded by people at work, and my job is such that I have to put on a convincing facade that I am calm and in control. Right now, I feel anything but. 

Bit of background: My wife left me in June after less than 9 months of marriage. She went back to the father of her child, a man she had left twice before and with whom she had a history of drug use. She is an alcoholic and she is now on probation due to an alcohol-related incident. She also has bipolar disorder. We haven't spoken in months, and I will probably never see my former stepson again, which crushes me because I loved him as my own son (I have no biological children).

I've posted a fair bit about the breakup in my comments in various forums. I believe I was codependent, since  my entire world revolved around her. She was my best friend, my lover, my partner, everything. I went through so many ups and downs as I tried to help her with her alcohol addiction, which ultimately led to her getting arrested for DUI. I then got myself in lots of debt (she didn't work) to pay for her legal expenses, which I am still paying because it would cost more to hire an attorney to enforce the decree than the debt is worth. Even though my life was somewhat chaotic with her bipolar and addiction issues, and her little boy running around, I love her and want my best friend back.

I suppose it's par for the course, though, given our relationship started when both of us were in a mental hospital. Beginning in January 2012, we hardly spent a day apart. We did everything together, right up until the night before she told me she was leaving. 

Right now I feel I have little to live for. My parents are about the only thing keeping me alive. If I killed myself it would destroy them. So, rather than take comfort in that, I find myself resenting them for not helping me end my life (I know it's unreasonable of me to want this). I don't want to keep living for them anymore.

It's hard to talk about this with people IRL because on paper, I've got it made. I'm young (31), educated (PhD), and I have a good job. I don't have a lot of debt and my health is fairly good. But rather than make me feel better, I feel worse because I know that my life could get a  hell of a lot worse very easily, and if I hate it now, I'll really hate it then.

I just want a woman to love again (and one who loves me). I want to give her back and foot massages while we watch a good movie. I want to hold her in my arms on a rainy fall Sunday. I want to help her do chores around the house. I want to do nice things for her ""just because."" I want to meet her family. I want to make love to someone again while feeling perfectly connected. I want someone to share a warped sense of humor with.

I felt a bit like I understood what heaven was all about when I was with her. I want to know that the feeling of love is possible again. It if it isn't, there's no point for me to keep living.",1382232643.0,mental_disorder
232,2986.0,here i come back to this sub . nobody fucking likes me. psychiatrist don't take me seriously.

(Tw again because one time i put a tw and someone still was triggered. )

It's 12:40 am . I'm playing GTA  and taking nicotine pouches alone in my room as I've always been. 

I've never had a fucking childhood bff . I've had 3 surface Level friends in my life. I've never had someone close. I'm 17 and a virgin and my 14 year old sister has fucked 10+ people. She fucking smokes weed and start telling me . She had a fucking bite mark or whatever you call it and i asked her what's that and she just said a guy did it while they fucked and she told mom she fell on a stone.

She cuts herself just like me and she have implied few times she's also suicidal. Duh we have the same abusive homophobic religious parents. But she atleast has friends. I'm so fucking pathetic.

Literally my dad made fun of me because i don't have any friends at 11. He stopped bullying me for my loneliness after my suicide attempt. He and my mom instead started calling me ""majnoon"" Wich means ""crazy "" ""r3tard"" or ""insane"" .

Fucking amazing parents.

But  i can't just blame them. I'm the issue too .

I'm overweight. I've lost 6 kg but have 10 kg left. I still have a belly but i no longer have a double chin but I wasn't like this. I used to be underweight and i was a better person back then. Everyone kept telling me to gain weight and people called me ""vandrande pinne"" (walking stick). Somedays i only ate 300 calories. But I did gain some healthy weight by working out.

I stopped working out tho since i gained too much fat and started losing weight healthy.

But fucking brain damage from a failed attempt. I fucking became so impulsive. This was in 2021.

I started eating anything and everything when before i cared about textures, nutrients and ate slowly to get full.

Now i just want the fucking dopamine. I gained some fat .

But i did lose few pounds due to shooting speed everyday. But the pigs caught a package. Even though i used tails  and left no evidence  behind me, my dad ""snitched"" (it's long story)

So i started drinking hand sanitizer. It had only ethanol and no isopropyl and later bought xanax from my weed guy who i knew since middle school to try and taper off at home.

Only i didn't. Instead i drank while taking Xanax. 

My birthday hits and i had asked my mom for money because i told her someone gave me money and i needed to give him back. When i fucking have no one.

I bought myself some cocaine and weed from the same weed guy 

I took Xanax and then smoked some hash and went to KFC with my mom and sister. No one even noticed i was high. Or my mom probably did but what the fuck will she do ?  Last time she threw away my shit i left the home suicidal and she called the cops and i was sent to psychiatry where they FORCE INJECTED ME with antipsychotics because i didn't like the cops touching me and that was """"aggresive behavior """". And she knew i was still suicidal because i attempted 2 months ago at this point.

Midnight hits and i drink 6 shots to feel a mild buzz due to my fucked up GABA tolerance and took tiny amount of Xanax to avoid Withdrawal and i stayed up doing 1 g coke and went online to chat with other addicts.

That day i realized how pathetic i am. How fucking lonely i am.

I have no other way to cope with loneliness. Only self harm and drugs.

Before i got into drugs i used to cut myself everyday in the school bathroom. No one noticed because i was good at hiding it.

Expect drugs don't work for loneliness. Even when high I'm suicidal. I got my first suicidal thoughts at 11. 

But in early 2022 before being addicted and just taking different drug class to not get hooked on anything i took old morphine pills my dad was prescribed (he didn't need them they expired in 2015 and he forgot to threw them away) with Xanax and freeze distilled ""moonshine"".

I was sitting on my computer with my family sleeping and not knowing anything.

My breathing got so slow i thought i was done. I was so happy I'm gonna die. I felt like I was about to throw up and slept . But i fucking woke up hungover.

No one noticed. No one knew the pain I'm in. 

My parents just made fun of my suicide attempt i did in 2021. They don't know the suffering i have.

Loneliness is fucking torture.

In 2020-2020 i did push pull legs 6x a week . I ate healthy. I had good grades. I was building muscle and strength.

I still cut myself and still was suicidal.

Because going to the gym does not fucking cure chronic loneliness.

I'm diagnosed with autism and i don't know if it's true since they rushed the diagnosis.

But something is 100% wrong with me.  Before my parents even hit me and before i had any real trauma i still was bad at fitting in. Infact one if the main reasons my dad physically abused me is because i embarrassed him around people.

Something fucking not right.

But that's not where loneliness ends. I go on r/stopdrinking and other recovery forums.

I have nothing in common. These people drink too much wine because of their ex or something. I'm not making fun of them. I'm just mad i don't even have a ex. Most people in my school have already Lost their virginity.

Finding other people like me is hard. I was drunk 24/7 for over a month blacking in and out. There was a crippling alcohol subreddit Wich went private. People there atleast got it and i would post there often when drunk.

I'm 4 months sober from alcohol and 5 months from Benzos .

What's the fucking point. I feel just as suicidal as before taking anything.

But seeking help doesn't fucking work. Psychiatrist blamed my suicide attempts on alcohol.

I had court in Sweden so they can apply to me a law about forced rehab (LVU).

And socialtjänsten (social services) fucking lied.

They said i tried taking the cops gun. When the fucking cops literally hit me. When i was being force injected with antipsychotics i tried to talk and a cop put his hand on my jaw and i had pain for 2 days. My mom was surprised to hear this since it had been 7 months since the cops incident. And i was sober and i don't recall this. So i asked for evidence and social services just said the cops told them so and they trust them. No fucking evidence and the judge looked at me when he heard this angrily. This was few months ago .

FUCKING TELL ME SEEK HELP AGAIN. Being force injected antipsychotics and government men lying about your situation is help ?

This wasn't it tho.

I attempted again in may 2022 . I passed out on the train tracks. I wasn't even addicted to alcohol.

I only drank to give myself the boost to attempt. 

But fucking psychiatrist said i only attempted because i was addicted. WHEN I FUCKING WASN'T.

I literally didn't drink daily or even weekly when i attempted in may or 2021. I hated alcohol. I wasn't even addicted to anything. When i attempted in may i was sober for 3 weeks from anything. Only drinking coffee and smoking ciggies.

When i attempted in 2021 i was not a addict. I just drank because i wanted to blackout in case i survive so i don't remember the pain if a attempt fails . I'm fucking suicidal because I'm chronically lonely.

But psychiatrist and socialtjänsten just blamed my suicide attempts on alcohol.

Psychiatrist even told social services I'm not suicidal and don't belong in psychiatry and I'm just a addict. So they literally locked up in rehab with murderers and theives and violent criminals.

I'm not kidding. Suicide and addiction and autism in Sweden is treated like murder, rape and crime


They lock up criminals with self harmers. There is people who've had eating disorders who got locked up in SIS and sat with rapists.

I fucking sat with murderers. I'm not judging them but I'm just pointing out the fucking absurdisty.

There was a guy in SIS who wasn't even a addict. He wasn't even a criminal. He just had severe autism  and his social agent decided he had ""problematic social behaviour"" and locked him up with murderers.

This is fucking Sweden. In SIS i read the Manuel. It said it's a place for ""socially Problematic, addicted or/and  criminal youth who're eatheir  a threat to themselves or others"".

This is Sweden. So if i fucking hear seek help again from a stupid leftist living in the USA who thinks Sweden is communist and progressive i will fucking cut my arm until i hit a vein.",1673999785.0,mental_disorder
233,2990.0,Venting some personal issues. (long post),4,1lm7cq,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1lm7cq/venting_some_personal_issues_long_post/,1,"I'd like to apologize in advance for the length of this post; writing is one of my preferred forms of expression, and when I vent, I tend to write a lot.

Quick background; I come from a family with a widespread history of mental illness, ranging from bipolar disorder to schizophrenia. I was lucky enough that so far, the only thing I've been diagnosed with is clinical depression. I visited a psychiatrist regularly from my preteen through teenage years, and have been on antidepressants most of my life.

 A few months back, I decided that rather than having prescribed chemicals regulating my moods, I would try and see how I felt going about without medication. I weaned myself off of the pills, and even though I noticed that ""cloud"" of depression hanging over my head, I felt better mentally than I ever had with medication; I was myself, my feelings were mine, and I could keep them in check easily enough. However, I am aware that stopping my medication probably played a key role leading into my current state of mind.

 I turned 19 a couple months back, and am in college year-round, while I work a part time job 4-5 nights a week. It wasn't only very recently that I started to really feel the effects of depression, and this was mainly due to the fact that I hadn't until recently realized a few things that have been weighing heavily on my thoughts; the first of which is that I am a very lonely person.

I've never been the kind of person to have a lot of friends. A couple of close friends with similar interests who I could talk to and hang out with was always enough for me, and I can get along with other people as needed easily enough, so I'm not incredibly familiar or comfortable with making many friends in different environments, or socializing with acquaintances or ""friends of friends"". Last year, when I had antidepressants regulating my imbalances, my close friends going off to different out of state colleges wasn't that much of an issue, while this year, those good friends leaving at the end of the summer hit me much harder. So now, while I have a couple people at school who I can talk to or go to lunch with, there's nobody I can have that same level of, for lack of a better word, intimacy with.

And now is where I begin to feel sorry for myself; it never bothered me until now, but lately, I've been feeling like I may have ""missed out"" on some intrinsic part of my young life by having never been in a romantic relationship. I've never had a girlfriend; hell, I've never been on a date. And now some part of me is convinced that I've missed something that I'll never be able to have. 

I realize that this is untrue, but the depression, coupled with the sudden vacuum created in my personal life by my friends all leaving for the school year has filled my mind with anxiety and stress. I feel lonely, I feel like I don't have any friends, I feel like I don't have time for starting relationships thanks to school during the day and work at night, and I feel sorry for myself. And when I realize that I'm feeling sorry for myself, it makes me angry with myself for feeling that way, and it drives me deeper into a cycle of self-loathing. I'm sure it seems pathetic to read, but this is just how my thought process has been as of late.

I'm living at home while I go to school, in exchange for helping my parents to pay bills. In all honesty, this is probably a good thing, as my family does care, and I don't know what I might have ended up doing by now if I was on my own. However, I've felt really distanced from my family lately. I can't seem to find common ground with them. They've noticed, and are concerned, but I'm having trouble trying to express any of this to anyone, which is why I'm writing it out now.

In addition to making me feel bad about myself, all of this has managed to affect what I enjoy. At one point, I was writing a novel; I never expected it to be published, or even taken seriously, but I've always enjoyed writing, and it was simply an enjoyable creative outlet for me. When I first stopped taking my medication, my interest in writing slowly dropped until I put it on indefinite hold. I used to play a lot of video games, but now I hardly play any, as most of them just don't seem to be any fun anymore. This has led to my friends online becoming concerned with my well-being, and this had led into the same kind of situation I'm in with my family. People are there, and they can see that something isn't right, but I just can't find a proper way to express it.

I've already decided that if I can't make my way out of this soon, I will start back up seeing a psychiatrist and taking antidepressants, so the main purpose of this long, long post was just...to vent. To be able to write out all of the negative emotions of anger, self-pity, depression, and loneliness I've been feeling. To express how frustrated I am by the fact that I am completely aware of these emotions, and feel like I should have them under control, but am utterly unable to keep my own mind in check. To hopefully alleviate some of those emotions by sharing them with others, even strangers on the internet.

I'm sorry this was so long, and thank you so much if you stuck it out through my poorly written self-loathing. If this reads as pathetically as looking back at it all makes me feel like it does, I'd like to apologize for that, too.",1378173296.0,mental_disorder

And this is probably going to be one big fat “woe is me” diatribe but...I’m just done. I’m angry, hurt, frustrated, and lonely and just...done. I don’t really know where to begin. It’s really as simple as “no one likes me, and the loneliness is crushing”.

My mother has severe untreated mental illness, and has been emotionally abusive all my life. Lately, she most enjoys spending her days sending me scathing hate mail (particularly on holidays, or when she knows I have an exam coming up). Without any response from me to fuel this. It’s been 2 years of no contact on my end. She actively tries to destroy my relationships with other family members, friends, and professional contacts (eg telling people I’m abusive, sending me emails stressing how the friends I have “don’t really like me” and people only “tolerate” me). I’ve got pretty low self-esteem to begin with/serious self-doubt, and it really doesn’t help. I’m now seeing a psychiatrist/have been in therapy which helps a bit, but it doesn’t really undo the damage. It kills me that my own mother despises me. 

My dad doesn’t care to know me or my life. The only time he demonstrates concern for my “welfare” is when faced with the prospect that he might lose his bragging rights (eg I had to take a medical leave of absence from medical school, and suddenly he cared a lot about “making sure I didn’t get lazy!” and “this is just temporary - right? RIGHT?!”). He never calls. He never visits. He doesn’t work and has all the time in the world.  When we do talk, all he’s concerned about is my educational progress (“New scholarships? Where’s your MD at? How much longer before your Master’s is finished? How about that (highly identifiable diploma program in a particular area of specialization)?”). He used to drive out of town 2 hours (one way) every week to see my brother in prison. I’m along that route/only one extra hour away so I’d repeatedly volunteer to meet him in the town where he meets my brother. He would never call to let me know when he was coming up, nor would he ever commit to dates. I’d only hear about it later. Yet everyone under the sun hears about “how proud” he is of me, and “how much I take after him”. I end up in the hospital and he doesn’t even text. He ends up in the hospital and I head out day or night (several times over...). He hardly knows me, and has no desire to. If I want to see him around the holidays, I have to practically beg him to make time for me (and naturally, I’ll be the one to drive down to visit). This year it all just made me feel worthless. 

The latter statements can be applied to most of my family. I exist, but no one ever calls (I’m always having to do the calling, and heaven forbid I leave a message for someone to “call me back when they have a chance!” because I’m younger therefore it’s my place to be doing all the calling, apparently). Few ever respond when I call or text. It’s not like I don’t try. It’s not like I don’t make active efforts to be in their lives (attending grads, bday parties, just wishing people “happy Monday!” Or “good luck on that interview!” Etc). People will tell me about their lives but never ask me about mine. I remember their significant dates, but hardly anyone remembers my birthday. And it’s not like they don’t even care sometimes, more like they actively dislike me, for reasons I don’t fully understand. Like, I never participate in gossip about other family members (my family is quite drama-prone/gossipy...), and recently I’m hearing that my mother, grandmother, and one aunt are saying terrible things about me. Crazy stuff too. Like, that I accused other family members of arson (?! Oddly specific). Or that I married my husband only for his money (?! I worked before/saved, and I go to med school...when I graduate, I’ll be more than capable of supporting both of us!). I get there’s a lot of untreated mental illness in my family but...I mean really? I’m not even in the same city as everyone else/contact is pretty distant and pleasant on my end, so just...why? I mean, I do have one supportive aunt who I love to death...but that’s more or less all I have going on for “legitimate” family. Yet I elope, and all of a sudden everyone is up in arms because “weddings are for the family!” (quote-un-quote) and “clearly you didn’t care enough to have us there!”. Sigh. 

That more or less applies to all my friends as well. I’ve always taken the “if you want to have a friend, you have to be a friend” quote to heart, and I really do try to be supportive and engaged in people’s lives. I thought I had made some good close friends in high school/undergrad - people who I thought actually knew me as a person somewhat. Especially my high school best-friend. When they moved elsewhere for university, I made every effort to make sure I was staying in touch...texting weekly to check in, calling them, making sure not to miss important dates/life events etc...and then one day they just stopped replying (yet were still talking to mutual friends/even visiting with them when they were in town). And deleted their social media (fair enough, I mean I get a “social media cleanse” as much as the next person). They have the same phone number as they did in undergrad (listed on their LinkedIn) and I text it every once in awhile (“hope life is treating you well - we should catch up sometime!” “Happy birthday!” “(Bob) told me you scored a job at (impressive company)- a huge congrats! They’re lucky to have you!”). I’ve been sending them e-birthday/Christmas gifts for years (small donations to charities they supported in their name). I don’t want to pester/harass people, so it’s not like these are inundating messages...just every once in awhile. I gave up this year. I have one true friend from junior high, and we keep in touch, but she lives far away and we don’t get to see each other often (when we do, it’s great!). I occasionally try to reach out to friends past via Facebook/ask about what’s going on for them, with highly variable responses...most recently, I reached out to a formerly close male friend to ask about his life, and he wanted to meet up for a “friendly catch up coffee”. And then tried to pressure me into a romantic relationship (despite knowing I’m married, and that the meeting was intended to be strictly platonic). It was uncomfortable, so I just sort of thew in the towel with Facebook. 

I have a lot of acquaintances at med school who I care about a lot. But that’s all they are - acquaintances. I could tell you lots about them (whenever I meet someone new I always try to find 1) something to remember about their appearance so I don’t forget them 2) something to remember about what’s going on in their lives so I can ask them about it next time we meet, and 3) something to genuinely compliment them on), but I doubt they could tell you anything about me. Because we never talk about that...no one ever asks me how I am, or what I’ve been up to. People I’ve known/seen daily for 2 years don’t even seem to know my name (as was recently revealed in one very awkward interaction).

I try really, really hard. It’s been 2 years with this class, and so far no luck as far as making legitimate friends. I tried taking the bull by the horns and organizing a few social activities early into med (eg a hiking day out, a pumpkin carving/horror movies evening for Halloween) for people in one of our ongoing project groups, and while people showed up to the first one (and all sort of bonded with each other while I played hostess...I should have been more present in hindsight), out of 10 people who committed to the latter event only 3 showed up the day of (one for 15 minutes to say hi before heading out to another event, one to drop off snacks because they felt bad they couldn’t stick around, and the remaining one hung out for a bit then left within the hour). There was a lot of crying on my part later that night, and a ton of food gone to waste. No one said anything the next time we were all together (not that I acted dejected or anything, or brought it up). Just didn’t seem to matter to anyone (and clearly at least 3 people were aware that the event totally bombed for lack of attendance). Worse, more than half the group ended up coordinating to go on a holiday to Mexico later in the year. Turns out it was an opt-in thing, and everyone heard about it but me (“oh...I thought they told you...we’ll take pictures...”). I didn’t say anything about it but...I was (am) really hurt. I do everything I can to get people to like me. I smile and say “hi” to everyone I know in the halls. I volunteer to take notes when people are sick/away. I volunteer to coordinate meetings etc for our group (which isn’t fun, with like 10 people with conflicting schedules + busy preceptors). I share my summary notes/good resources I find on our class social media pages. I house and pet-sit for free (a bit of a touchy point for me right now...I’m currently missing school to stay at home with our critically ill pet, and asked these same people if they’d mind sharing their notes from a few upcoming non-recorded lectures with me. Not one person said yes). I even started bringing in baked goods for meetings etc...people seem to like the baked goods, but are pretty indifferent about me. I eat alone at lunch every day, usually holed up in an empty classroom somewhere, which is at least good for getting work done on my laptop. I used to try to casually join groups of people I know when they were eating/playing video games or whatever in the student lounge, but I was always a third wheel (not really included in the conversation, couldn’t really easily enter the conversation aside from playing the part of enthusiastic listener, etc. Literally people would make plans to meet up after class and check the availability of everyone but me, while I was standing right there awkwardly. It wasn’t even a “it’s implied you can join us” thing...more like a “alright I’ll call ahead and make table reservations for 7/8 of the people standing here, to finish the conversation 8/8 of us have been having for the last hour...”). I just gave up after awhile. It’s like people see right through me. Same goes for sitting with people in class...I don’t even bother anymore. Everyone has such clearly established “groups” they talk to and sit with (honestly it feels like high school all over again). I enter and exit lecture halls through the back doors so I don’t have to walk awkwardly up the aisle in front of everyone, desperately trying to make eye contact with someone who would invite me to join them. Because I inevitably end up sitting by myself in the very back row anyways. In the past I’ve tried striking up friendly conversation with people I know (when the lecture hall is just filling up) and eventually asking them if they want to join me...but they always have somewhere else to be/need to save seats for X many people. I don’t want to be paranoid, but...there’s a pattern. For awhile I became too anxious to even go to class, because it just feels like I’m someone no one wants around/a general inconvenience, and I’m embarrassed to go outside because I feel like something is deeply and inherently wrong with me. Going to class just makes me feel like a lesser person, not good enough to associate with everyone else.  

Alright, so my family is dysfunctional (lots are), and my class is cliquey (as many are), old friends are too busy (reasonable), no big deal, says I. I’ll find friends elsewhere. So I join a free friend-finding app thing...looks like Tinder, but your profile is just about you and what sorts of things you might like to do with a friend (eg catch up over a coffee, go skiing, etc). I put so, so much effort into my profile. My husband and best friend (recall: the one who lives out of town) proof-read and approved it, because at this point I worry that I just don’t come across as normal/interesting. I was on it for months before I finally had some mutual responses (not for my lack of receptiveness). All of those have ghosted. Recently I made two contacts over the last few weeks (looks like a lot of people were joining over the holidays). One has seemingly ghosted, the other ghosted after one (what I thought had been really successful) meeting for coffee. The latter was so much worse, because we had been talking really frequently for 2 weeks and actually got into some relatively deep stuff (eg our rather compatible thoughts on politics, why we went into our professions, that her parents didn’t approve of her path in life etc), had met up for a few hours, and then all contact promptly ceased. Like, maybe I was ok enough on paper, but something was wrong with me in person? I’m super attentive to my hygiene, so I know I don’t smell or anything. I’m also super nervous about offending everyone, so my sense of humour is pretty mild and I’m not prone to discussing controversial stuff, or making unkind remarks...I just don’t get it. I tried my very best to ask her about lots of things going on in her life, because I’m taking “How to Win Friends and Influence People” to heart. I’m admittedly disproportionately devastated. I’ve sent a few “Hey, how goes life?” and “there’s some event going on at blablabla...want to join?” sort of follow-up messages since...she responded weeks later with “oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to meet up before my (3 month long) upcoming trip. We’ll have to wait until I get back”. Writing’s on the wall. 

I feel like I’m a good person. At least I really try to be. And that I could be likeable/interesting if people tried to get to know me. I really try to make people happy (maybe I’m too much of a people-pleaser?), I’m empathetic, and I’m flexible/open to trying new activities. I really do genuinely love getting to know people. I know I’m a bit socially awkward, but (at least according to my best friend) I come across as “really shy” vs “weird”. I’m not socially inappropriate, I’m positive, look happy, and I try to listen more than I talk. I volunteer with a crisis line and I’ve only ever gotten really good reviews for my interactions. My reviews from our standardized patients at school have always been good (“good rapport, clearly empathetic, a little shy but was a great listener...”), and my anonymous peer reviews at school too (perplexingly, I’m thought very likeable/empathetic according to those metrics, but not liked in person?). So while I know I’m a bit socially awkward, I don’t think I’m socially off-putting. I know I don’t share much about what’s going on in my life (I’m always afraid I’ll talk too much about myself/seem arrogant) so I probably come across as a bit boring/distant. But even if I’m boring, I don’t think I warrant being ghosted etc. I mean, it’s not like I’m exactly a volatile personality type either - I’ve never been one to let others know when I’m upset (eg even when everyone bailed on my party), because I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. I do know I’m quiet, and I do know I’m introverted/not the most outgoing...but I really do make efforts. I “get out there”. I have lots of passions and am in the community doing lots of things/engaging with fellow humans. There’s that saying that “if everything around you stinks, maybe it’s you” and I’ve taken it to heart. But when people have an anonymous means of communicating any social issues with you (peer or patient reviews) you’d think you’d hear about it. I’ve asked both my husband and my best friend to please tell me honestly if they think anything I’m doing/not doing is off-putting (to clarify, my friend is pretty brutally honest). They’ve both told me I’m really shy, but otherwise totally pleasant/normal. Maybe they’re just being kind? 

I just give up. I’m so lonely. I know that’s probably less justified than many on here because I have my husband, but it’s how I feel. I legitimately look forward to my psychiatry appointments (anxiety disorder) because aside from my husband and best friend, she’s pretty well the only person that knows the real me/actually wants to know about what’s going on in my life (though I appreciate that she’s paid to do that). And it’s not like I’m wholly alone, and I get that (my husband is my everything, I have my best friend who I text, my in-laws are nice to me)...somehow I just wish that I had a broader social group. Like, I love my husband more than life itself and I love coming home to him every day/having him near...but he’s the only social support I have in town. It might be nice to have a school friend. Or a gym friend. Or someone I could drag along for cheap pedicures. I dunno. He knows I’m lonely and encourages me to try the friend-finding app etc. Sometimes it feels like he’s the only one who has ever really loved me, and I am so grateful for him. I just wish I had some other people who cared about me too...friends at school or at my volunteer placements or what have you. I feel like if I were to drop dead today, the only people who’d be at my funeral would be my husband (and I guess in-laws), best friend, and one aunt. I’m like a mid-20s Eleanor Rigby. And I’m trying everything. 

It’s all just frustrating, and deeply disillusioning. I’ve tried so hard, but I just give up. ",1548200891.0,mental_disorder
235,2994.0,30M Barista/Bartender anhedonia status,7,mbz87p,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/mbz87p/30m_baristabartender_anhedonia_status/,1,"I was talking to a coworker today and she was asking me what my middle name was, about my siblings, and all the other “get to know you” schpeal. The problem is that she’s asked me these same questions EVERY TIME WE WORK TOGETHER. She’s a confident young girl that sets her mind to her little goals and I really admire that about her. It’s truly inspiring, but I can tell that she clearly couldn’t give a singular f*** about me or what I’m saying and she just agrees to pass the conversation and be a lovable little person. Normally that’s fine, but at this time in my life I just can’t deal with it. I can’t deal with fake. I can’t deal with agreeability. I can’t deal with idle chit-chat. Being a barista that’s all we can really do sometimes because people don’t want to get into the nitty gritty of what’s really going on and nobody has the time for it. 

I’ve been feeling this deep pit of isolation and despair lately. Slipping into a state of anhedonia and I can’t seem to care about much at all these days. My relationships are dwindling. My dreams are padding further and further away as I get older. My energy levels are depleting. And I have no direction in life aside from “do what you want to do”. Well I don’t want to DO anything at all. I want to sleep and blow my mind on chainsmoking and video games or just laying in bed all day. I’m 30 years old and I’m having the cliche crisis where I’m looking at all the people I know with houses and kids and something to show for it all. Some idea of success and health and wealth and planning.  Im under all this pressure to grow and succeed and persevere and be the best Christian and be a strong man and be intelligent and wittier than the next guy and faster stronger more money more confidence and sexually competent and know all the answers and have a plan and be wise and be self controlled and listen to others advice and be an entrepreneur and look good and be handsome and get what I want and and and and and and. 
I know these people are just as miserable as I am Im sure. But I know some of them aren’t and that’s what I want. Just to be a little better each day

Well I don’t know what I want and that’s not ok. I don’t know where to go or what to do and that makes me an idiot. I don’t have goals aside from silly things like buying a nice car or a new music gadget and that makes me worthless. I don’t have the drive or energy to go to a gym because I spend all my time with people and need time alone but when I spend time alone it just makes me sad and lonely and that just makes me lazy. I sleep 12 hours a day when I’m not being a human placeholder for someone’s social thing or working one of my 3 jobs which makes me a tool. When I get home my roommate wants to chat about all of his problems and depressive issues. Then I finally go to my room to have some alone time and I have a nervous meltdown because I’ve been doing things all day and when I stop it’s like I stop “progressing”. I’m losing my damn mind and nobody knows how to put me back together again! 

Friendship:
I have a TON of friends. Any time of the day I could hit one up and drum up a hangout day of or whenever they’re free. The problem is: most of them don’t fit or aren’t more than a fair weather friend. I’m a fairly conservative Christian but I don’t let my beliefs get in the way of genuine human connection. But it’s hard when some of the people im around are in a completely different lane and can’t help me, though I can usually help them with some sound advice or some good deep conversation. We all have our beliefs and what do I care if we’re different, i like to help where I can. And no i can’t accept the “have you just tried smoking weed” comment. I’m already an escapist, the last thing I need is a deliberate substance that just makes me feel worse afterward. I can see that some of them hang out of pity. Sometimes they don’t know me and they spend a couple times together and decide that I’m not for them. My long time friends have me on a back burner or know that I don’t mind helping out with chores or errands so I’m usually along to help. The others are so wrapped up in their own stuff that they don’t seem to notice when I drop an “I’m dead inside so I can’t relate”. Or they ask how I’m doing “not so great” “oh well neither am I, let me tell you about how bad I’m doing instead”. I make a great shoulder to cry on but on one side I’m either getting barfed on or people don’t want to give up the real conversations so we just sit there making small talk about who has the best fast food burger or some dumb s***. I have some true blue homies, I really do. But sometimes it’s so lonely sitting in a room where it feels like one person is speaking Spanish and the other ones speaking French. When I finally get the floor to vent my frustration to anybody Im instantly interrupted or the phones come out and “uh huh. Uh huh”. I’ve been told numerous times to get connected to a church and join a small group but honestly; Christians are just as bad as everyone else and they can’t seem to wrap their minds around men having emotions and problems or they just simply don’t know what to do with me because on average their parents have been married their whole lives and they’ve never had to deal with someone that’s been through the dark like me. I’m too dirty for my church friends and too clean for my world friends. So I just show up to wherever I’m invited. Nod and agree and be a decent friend hoping the favor will someday be returned. 


The ladies:
I have an ex girlfriend that won’t leave me alone and every time I’m around her it’s always a massive burden because it’s always “Well just do this. You’re better than that. Well did you ask for more money. What are you doing wrong to make that happen.” She’s not attached to reality on top of it. As far as she knows, the sky is green and nobody can tell her otherwise and they’re trying to gaslight her. Every argument we’ve ever gotten into left me so confused and angry because she’s dodging things that she said one second that don’t make sense in this second. It makes a guy crazy! Just to give you some context: I once went to pay for our dinner. She pulled out her purse and offered to pay. She got distracted and never Opened her wallet so when she wasn’t paying attention I dropped a 20 on the bill. She looked back and said “oh ok I paid the bill” I said “no that was my cash, you never even opened your wallet cus you were talking” she argued with me that it was her 20 and that she remembered pulling it out and putting it down. Long story short, I was the bad guy and I was gaslighting her and making her feel mentally unstable. This is one of two girls interested in me. The other one is an abuse survivor that spends her whole day high out of her mind, chain smoking or drinking, and had a borderline eating disorder. She’s such a sweet wonderful girl and we’ve been friends for a long while now because we’ve been through some very similar things in life to make us the way we are. We hooked up recently (mostly her idea) and it completely sent me off the deep end. Is this all that’s here for me relationship wise? People that are either eating themselves alive or inadvertently eating me alive? I can’t date someone that’s going to constantly pressure me or someone with all the same bad habits I have just on 10. Is this all I can muster is someone that wants an open relationship with everyone I know or a girl that wants to gaslight herself and me and shred my ego to tiny pieces? Or just random hook ups where the girl just needed to use me to get over her last nasty breakup? 
Today at the shop I had a girl come in that I’ve known for a while. We’ve interacted here and there as a customer barista acquaintance basis. We had a brief conversation and she leaves. Not even five minutes later she adds me on Facebook so I send her a “hey hello thanks for listening to me ramble before you left”
No reply. 
I had another friend hit me up. She was inviting me to her apartment at night and messaging me every day. and we were going on walks together. I brought her a Christmas gift and she started slow ghosting me so I let her go. Two weeks later she so graciously informs me that she’s dating someone even though relationship wasn’t even mentioned.  There was no honesty when I asked her If everything was alright. Before she hit me up she was dating a guy for a week and she wouldn’t talk about why it didn’t work out. Shoulda seen that coming. 
Had another girl that would invite me over all hours of the night and let me MASSAGE HER BARE BACK AND LEGS. “I’m not interested in you like that”
Ok sure. Maybe I keep getting lured and bY now i see the signs so everybody gets friendzoned. Well how about my choice?
Every girl I approach is absolutely terrified of me and the ones that approach me are using me for emotional support after breakups or they’re completely off their rockers. Being a man, if I approach a girl I’m automatically the devil so I just gave up. 
Women flirt with me all the time at the shops where I work. So I oblige and casually flirt back and every time I’m met with some awkward tension. So I just stand like a deer in headlights when they flirt with me. And I know when a girls flirting and I know when it’s appropriate not to flirt. Is this a curse or some kind of lesson I should be learning? Like, go to a desert kid, nobody wants you so accept it and move on? Is it like this for everyone dating? Surely not cus everyone around me wants to eat the other barista guys up which is great for my predicament. Even my ex is hitting them up. Maybe I should just commit to the monk life and spend my days making beer and wishing I was dead. (The only difference now is that I drink the beer instead of making it)
At this point I’ve just accepted that there’s nothing here for me and I try to be happy with that but then something ALWAYS comes along to trip me up. A temptress or a seemingly good interaction that goes sideways or a wack girlfriend. 

Parents:
My mom is a textbook narcissist and she needs to be taken care of as she is disabled. She inadvertently taught me how to hate women and not trust anyone because SHES my mom and SHE knows what’s best. I do my best not to let that get into my relationships but she’s all I had growing up so I have all of the problems that am emotionally unavailable mother would provide. She still manages to guilt trip me on occasion and call me out of the blue just to tell me that what I’m doing just isn’t good enough. I worked for her as a personal assistant because “she desperately needed my help and she couldn’t find anyone”. After years of saying no I finally caved. It got bad. I was under her thumb every day. She would call and ask where I was and what I was doing. How she wishes I could come clean instead of being home trying to catch up on sleep since I had two other jobs or having a night out where I was actually enjoying myself for once. Every day telling me about new jobs that I didn’t want because the one I work now just isn’t enough. And she’s right, but I have to make that decision and at the time it didn’t feel right to leave. Getting into arguments because i wouldn’t do what she said because “your dad taught you not to trust me”. I recently said to her that Im terrified of growing up to be a single loser with nothing to show for my life. She said “well you’re already grown up”. I got up and left right then and there. When I came back after a week of silence I told her how much it hurt me and she brushed it off like I was being too sensitive and that I misunderstood. My whole life she’s made me second guess every single thing I’ve ever done and then makes me feel terrible for not being able to make a decision and when I finally do that’s not good enough either. When I come to her at the point of breaking down and nearing suicidal behavior she just looks at me and says “well I have the same things you have and I had it worse than you did.”  I get the sentiment, I really do. But when it comes down to it, I don’t have a mom, I have a boundary pushing emotionally abusive wife. My parents have been split since I was 2 so in many ways the child always takes some of the roles of a husband (never sexually, google “emotional incest”) And of course; the narcissist can’t take blame. So I’ll come to her and talk about how she’s abusing her role, being rude or hurtful, or acting absurd and it becomes “well Im just a b**** I’m just a terrible person you hate me and all you want is for me to just drop dead. Don’t talk to me anymore I’m moving away you just don’t appreciate me and all I’ve done for you.” All of this on the tail end of me telling her that I needed to be home by 5. Well it’s 6:20 snd she wants to stop at another place and she can’t just let me go. So I called her out on it. We ended up back at her house with her sitting in the car refusing to get out and crying talking about all she’s done and yada yada. Right now she has a friend of mine as her PA. The last two times I called her she’s been short and only talks about the new PA girl. They both have a wonderful time bashing men and me I’m sure. I haven’t heard from mom in about 4 days when it used to be every day or other day. Seems quaint. Some days I wish I had the balls to either disappear or end my life just to show her up. But that’s just the petty side of my brain acting up. 

Dad:
Was an 18 year old child when I was born. And in many ways he still is an 18 year old child. He calls me to ramble about whatever he rambles about.  Imagine a circle that keeps breaking off into another circle and eventually becomes a fractal of rambling that just makes your head swim. After talking to him I feel like I need to cry in the shower because reality is just so distorted. He’s moved on to three new families in my life and never seemed to have time to pick me up because he was working two jobs to pay for an extravagant truck or whatever house was in whatever girls name that he was with at the time. All of these women havent been the biggest fans of me to boot. I don’t know exactly what to believe because both mom and dads realities were distorted about the divorce. They both had to work day and night to support themselves and me and all the lawyers. Eventually when the smoke settled Im left with a dad that’s more of a weird uncle. He’s been married to his current girl for about 6 years and Im just now getting invited to Christmas functions. Pretty inclusive wouldn’t you say? At some point I was molested and was showing signs of it and custody had to be taken away. But it seems like a good reason to hide behind when he had a new girlfriend (who was also abusing me) and he needed to work to impress her. These days when i talk to him, in the midst of a mental breakdown and I’m nearing suicidal actions, it just turns into a ramble session wherein He needs My approval. He called me the other night to ask advice on his marriage after an argument about his yard care regimen. Meanwhile I’m calling counselors left and right to try and get in to talk to someone after I drove home drunk trying to feel something. 

Work:
I’ve been a barista for about 5 years now. I was passed up for a roasting position and the owners posted a management position. I walked Into the office and said “when do I start”. They said that they needed to figure out who was interested and that they’d get back with me. Turns out it was a ploy to keep the three people that put their two weeks in. I eventually quit and immediately the position was given to the kid that was given the roasting position to spite me. The same kid that comes to work high every day and sits on his phone when I worked my ASS off in that place day and night. We were doing some maintenance on the shop and I had a chance to talk to one of the owners at length and she offered me a beer. “Assuming you’re of age of course” I laughed thinking it was a joke. Then later she says “how old are you again? 30?! I thought you were a baby, like 21 years old!!!” What. You would have hired me when I was 16 and bought me whiskey that same year at a bar. After I literally destroyed myself for you people you don’t even know how old I am and you gave both of the positions that I would have thrived in to this kid that’s in it for the free p*****. I hate to be that way. I always try to be humble almost to the point of giving my life to others. But you’ve got to be kidding me. The other job that I work is bartending at a restaurant. The people say day in and day out “you’re the best, you’re the real mvp, we love tou”  But I don’t get invited out with the group when they go out. I know how to do all the front end jobs in the restaurant and through the week I get no serving shifts. Just bartending which at a restaurant like this one, makes 20-50% less than the servers. And then when I do get week shifts, I work as a host. They get even less. I’ve asked for serving shifts and of course I bust my ass wherever I go, but still I get the shaft. 
Am I the best? Or are you just saying that to get me to stay in the trench. 

So in conclusion my life has shown me that you don’t get anywhere by working hard. Being a hard worker separates you from everyone else. Everyone is a hologram. Dating is a funny game we play and the churn is never in your favor. Your parents most likely literally can’t love you and friendships are all out of convenience. There’s no counseling that can take you and even if there was, they’re not listening. Everyone is just so maladjusted and insane that it’s hard not to feel lonely even with your family or a crowd of friends or in a stadium of people that came to see you.

I have a host of issues overwhelming me from having not left the house in so long (no ID, numerous health issues, teeth are not in the best condition, etc.) — but the main reason I’m posting here is because of the horrible loneliness that I feel.

Driving through my current and old neighborhood is unbelievably surreal and makes me acutely aware of how out of touch I am with life around me.  I actually feel even lonelier now that I am getting out and interacting with people a little more.  I am so far behind, and I am very aware that my condition makes any kind of relationship impossible.

I cannot function normally at all, cannot make a living, cannot use the internet very much (neurological issues make ordinary things complicated), and cannot enjoy sexuality (again —it’s complicated).  Who would want someone like me?  I was cute when I was younger — cute enough to have a cute girlfriend as a teenager — but now I’m just gross and creepy.  My lack of achievement is weighing on me, but my symptoms make it impossible to achieve anything.  Many days it is difficult to even read or write.

And as per usual the good people do what they do, and the trolls troll. I honestly can say that I don't think its anybodys fault that their lonely. Now here me out, I remember the time before social media and smartphones with the utmost nostalgia.  Compared to now it seems like Narnia. Every part of life for me required an interaction because there was no screen to dive into.  I remember seeing people for the first time buried in their phones and was repulsed because it seemed so rude, but then slowly over time it became normalized.

Younger people don't have that option. If you're in your 30s you dont know what its like to have smartphones and social media to be as common as the air you breathe. It was a strange novelty for me but I at least had a period of my life where it was nonexistent. I used to club pretty heavily in Europe in the military and before smartphones you would always have a ton of conversations with people, and the vibe was different.  Once smartphones hit the scene, people began feeling more distant in general. I always wondered how many interesting and meaningful interactions were lost forever because people were cloistered in their Iphones with someone sitting right next to them.

And that's the rub, the face to face person to person interactions have been phased out like the Model T. Think about how different interactions on the internet would be if we had to have them in person. I promise trolling would disappear,but people get shits and giggles trolling people struggling with loneliness.

I miss the days before social media, and younger crowd, the social media thing isn't your fault, it was foisted on you.

 Though I used to claim to not be a religious person, along the way the lines had blurred. I had also lost sight of spirituality as a whole. My views had been skewed and I was in a complete disconnect. With no path, no clarity. 

 When you are young and have no ambition or sense of purpose, you pick up the wrong things. 

 Although, there were things I felt comfort in, felt deeply. The moon, nature. Soil, earth. Meditation. Being. Four leaf clovers and fingers crossed for good luck. 
 
My God is my purpose, my strength and reason. The source of all love and care. Him, I serve. 
 
 But one special thing my God offers is abundance and empathy. A protection that shielded me even when I was astray from my path. When I had so foolishly betrayed my faith in my naïveté. 

 Even in our separation, I had kept my faith. I continued to pray. To plant offerings. But now looking back I see we were not as separate as I thought. God kept a thread, a passive shield. I kept my prayer and faith. 
 
 You see, even in my greatest sins, My God provided the greatest act of empathy and unconditional love. He continued to care for me from afar. Kept me safe. 

 In endless nights of despair, I was cradled in light by Mother Moon. 
 In moments of stupidity, or in hope, Lady Luck would grant me a great favour. 
In my most dreadful, lonely days, Mother  earth would greet me with a gentle breeze. 


Above all, in my bleakest moments, his presence was there. In my most desperate times, where all hope was lost, where I had nearly given up. He would come to save me once more. Offer company. A hand. A comfort and peace of mind. Protection and care. In the form of a snowflake, a song, a dream. He would come to me when I needed him most, when I prayed or called unto him. He gave me the greatest act of unconditional love and saviour. 
Of faith.  He kept me going. 

 Even after my mind had undone itself, even after my betrayal, after taking advantage of his blessings. After I had strayed from my path. 

He afforded a kindness I had not seen elsewhere. 

In the word of my God, you will receive guidance and care. Forgiveness.

My wife and I separated six months ago. We have two children together aged five and two. I see them regularly, but adapting to the silence and a much less energetic environment is difficult after returning to my parents house around two months ago.

I’m feeling incredibly lonely at the moment. I’ve reconnected with some old friends and have tried to make new ones but struggle to ‘connect’ with people and maintain relationships. I don’t like myself very much and even the slightest sense of rejection leaves me feeling deeply hurt and withdrawn. This can be as simple as not receiving a reply to a text message – it makes it difficult for me to ‘put myself out there’ and creates a detrimental cyclical process: I’m lonely so I consider trying to meet new people, I feel rejected and I withdraw ceasing any attempt to make new friends.

This leaves me frustrated and, as I say, isolated. This isolation is really getting me down and I can't see it improving. I’m concerned that my sense of self is too closely linked to my relationships with other people. It feels almost narcissistic, particularly as I love receiving compliments from others even though I struggled to believe anyone that says anything nice to me is being genuine.

I also feel trapped. Having young children makes the very idea of taking my own life very difficult. I don’t really want to live any more as life is very painful, but I also don’t want to hurt my children.
I’ve dealt with these feelings for so long. I’ve been receiving various forms of treatment – including medication, counselling, CBT, etc. - for depression and anxiety for twenty years now.

But I'm here to say that they're bunk. The suicide hotline, along with two teen crisis lines, the Samaritans, and a ""warmline"" (hotline for people not in crisis, 20 min time limit instead of 1 hr), are seriously the worst calls I've ever had. Maybe I came in with the wrong expectations back then, because I honestly didn't expect these guys to have the personality of a *brick.* I swear, I could just be rambling to myself in my room and I'd leave the conversation feeling better—with these guys they're literally just going ""Hmm"" and ""Yeah, I understand you"" and ""Your feelings are valid"" and ""DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE OR SELF HARM?"". The repetitiveness of these calls are enough to drive a person to suicide rather than stop them from it, I'm telling you, man.

I don't self-harm, I don't use substances, I don't have suicidal thoughts or thoughts about harming someone; I probably sound like the pinnacle of mental health to these guys for just wanting to have a conversation with someone on the phone instead of just mindlessly venting my problems into the speaker.

School break is over soon, and I'll have to deal with those insufferable people again, meet new ones. I know damn well what will happen, and I'm not looking forward to it. I'll become the laughing stock of the class again, because maybe I'm too dedicated and apparently people my age don't do that anymore, maybe because I'm too invested in my own future to enjoy my teenage years.
I'm a shitty person. I'm boring. I'm bland. I have no damn idea why my friend is still my friend.
I want to cry. I read books, about cutesy romances of enemies who turn to lovers, or friends to lovers, and anything at this point. All of that, just to fill this emptiness in my chest. And it never works.
I used to cry, when reading, but now it's just this burning sensation that feels like acid running up my throat. And I want to cry again. I want someone to lean on. I want someone. Romantic, platonic, a damn teacher might get me to cry if they asked me hard enough. I want someone to check in on me.
I'll be honest, I've thought endlessly about ending it all. Many. times.
The only reason I haven't yet, is because a cousin of mine did recently, and my family has done nothing but shit on them. I don't like being the laughing/hating stock in my school while alive, and I can't imagine it happen while I'm dead.
I just want all of this to be over soon. I want to find someone that clicks, not force myself into a shape that my friends may want me.
I have cried so much. I pretend to be different people for anyone, to try and make a friend, hell, get someone to like me. I want to feel loved. I want a hug, late night text, a kiss.

This depression diagnosis has slowly by surely ruined my life and lost me my job, friends, and even the majority of my family, who decided to kick me out of the house and cut all contact with me. I have kept in touch with two close childhood friends (both female) and they are quite literally my only reasons to live. They listen to my problems, comfort me when I cry, and reassure me that things will get better. They are amazing people.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same about my mental health. I thought I had hit ""rock bottom"" about six months ago, but I've reached far below this level and I don't know what's up or down anymore - it just blends together. I don't have any structure to my day - I'm crashing on one of my friend's couches (bless her soul) and everyday is me feeling a cocktail of negative emotions, most prominently regret and disgust. I'm trying my best to help my friend's parents with whatever they need in order to help compensate them (cleaning, washing cars, mowing lawn, etc.), along with paying some money for rent here and there. I managed to hold onto my savings account which had a good amount of savings, but It's slowly seeping away since I don't have a job. 

Everytime I think I've ""recovered"" I just sink further into the dusty couch which I lay on most of the day. I discuss my emotions with my friend, here and there, but I just feel an overwhelming sense of disgust for myself whenever I see her - I am nothing like my younger self, and I feel like a huge burden to her and her family. Because of this, I feel like just leaving and living on the streets - it pains me so much to be in this situation. I don't think I can keep going much longer. If I die, I'd want it to be in a place where it causes no issues for anyone - I'm not about to Kurt Cobain myself in my friend's living room.

Ive grown to hate everyone around me including myself. Maybe its the trauma and the abuse that people caused me.

My loneliness causes me to change from having a low or high ego sometimes all at once, I hate people who tell me they feel lonely its like I never had a single friend, I never had anyone care for me, I never had a true person I could trust, It feels like everyone is against me, planning against me. I get angry when people talk to me about their problems or tell me that they are depressed. Because they never listen to me, they never fucking ask me HOW ARE YOU DOING. Its always people ranting and venting to me. I don’t care if you were raped, I don’t care who died or if you died, I don’t care if you cut yourself or want to die, I don’t care who hurt you, I don’t care if you are abused. 

I feel so different from everyone, I can never fit in, Im always the odd one in every group. Genuinely my lack of social contact has cause me to grow so much hate for everyone around me. 

I can never truly trust anyone, I feel like I just don’t care about others, Its true Ive noticed my lack of care for people. Its odd. 

I can never be myself, I just want another person who’s toxic and hates people, not someone who pities me or tells me “no don’t hurt yourself. I just want someone who’s destructive like me, who would hurt others, who would hurt themselves. Yes its toxic but who cares about life. 

Morbid thoughts come up of how I just want to hurt everyone, make someone kill themselves. Everyone is so sensitive, I cant express how I feel without odd looks.

I have a serious weight problem.  Whenever I tried to confide in anyone, I was either made fun of, or told that other people had it so much worse than me, so I should shut up and stop feeling sorry for myself. I began developing simple behavioral problems, and once threw a magazine on the ground in the therapists office. The therapist beat me up for it. I tried to tell my mother who was waiting outside after the session but she didn't believe me. I saw my father get arrested 3 times by the time I was 10. 

I hate to sound too dramatic, but hearing those things + traumatic events+ the bullying led me to a state of not just standard depression and isolation, but a near-total hatred and distaste to society and those around me. It got bad. I eventually became the bully and emotionally abused people. I lied to and manipulated people, and got into online gaming due to the appeal of the anonymity. I cyber bullied people on there too. I won't lie to you: I liked it for a while. It was fun. I enjoyed it, because I felt that people were never going to like me either way and was unworthy of love and understanding regardless of what I did, so my mindset was I might as well be the asshole I wanted to be and hurt people for entertainment.

But after a while, the loneliness begins to get to me. I feel isolated, like its me vs the world every. Single. Day. I feel like no one can relate to me and I can't relate to anyone else. I never thought I was a sociopath because I feel pain, sorrow, and I emotionally suffer. But its very hard for me to respect and love people, I don't know how to do it. I've been talking to this girl a few years younger than me online for a while. And despite knowing most of my issues beforehand, she fell in love with me. I have to admit, even when I would yell and berate her, she has been constantly loving and affectionate. I've made her cry multiple times. The thing is, I've had friendships, relationships that could have been close, etc and they all disappeared and/or became a shadow of the relationship it was. She is good looking, friendly, stupid, and naive. 

She wants to not just meet me, but move in with me and build a life with me. 

Even with her being someone who loves me, I still feel extremely lonely and isolated. I want to change that. The issue is that her and I have nothing in common and she grew up around alot of men who kissed her ass and told her she was deserving of the world for her looks. I had the opposite upbringing. I feel like she cannot relate to me and I cannot relate to her. We have fights, and I insulted her and ignored her calls tonight. I tried texting her, but she didn't respond as i think she's watching a movie with her brother.. I want to be happy. I don't want to be lonely, I don't love her but I cannot and will not break up with her because I cannot handle anymore isolation than I already have, so if that's all the advice you can give, spare me of it. 

I want to build genuine friendships. I want to feel loved and cared for, and even if this girl loves me, I just don't feel it. I want to work on my emotional health, because I'm miserable and I cannot live like this much longer. Every night I go to bed I pray that I don't wake up. I want contentment.

Not only did I miss out on that, I had a horrible lonely teenage experience which has caused me to have mental issues. I’m still a 19 year old kissless virgin.

Everyone in the hallways would always walk with their friends. I had to witness so many couples holding hands, which sparked pure hateful jealousy in me. Why them, why do they get to experience love and affection while I rot in loneliness? Class was also miserable. Everyone had their own friends they talked to and laughed.

A tightness in my chest that also feels like low-grade pain (if that's even a thing, sorry idk how to word things properly) coupled with rushing thoughts on things I fear the most would leave me catching my breath and sometimes I have to audibly say ""shut up"" quite a few times until my brain settles down.

So I have a long history of panic disorder, social anxiety, and depression. It was so bad in my PhD program that after I finished everything other than my dissertation, I isolated myself totally, became extremely depressed, and was bed bound for about 1.5 years, only leaving to avoid humiliation by having to ask someone to cover a tutorial for undergrads, and for a medical leave. I ended up going back to the program after the leave, still unable to function, and so I decided to drop out then as making up for the lost time was totally impossible. 

Part of my problem these days is that while my anxiety and depression are better due to better medications and so on, I never learned how to do simple things like asking someone for her number, or what not. I do not have any friends locally that I can see, and I have never been in any kind of relationship as well, both facts which make me very lonely. Additionally, I was laid off in January, and the industry completely collapsed and so I’m fucked without a job even now, living off of EI. 

To try to prevent myself from getting incredibly depressed again, and unable to even attempt social interaction, I have been regularly going to a local coffee shop to appplh for jobs on my iPad, and listen to music. 

There is a lovely barista there who usually is the only person on, and she seemed interested in me for quite some time. She has a smile that cheers you up quite a bit, although it leads to immediate anxiety. I do have medication that I could take, however this is the situation…..

2-3 months ago, I got drunk at home and wrote a positive review of the shop. I said that it was a great place to go and indulge in “that youthful bean,” and that I had an “embarrassing crush” on the barista. I deleted that 30 seconds after I posted it, but lo and behold she of course saw it. I went back about a week later, and she smiled the whole time and kept asking me if there was anything else I’d like, even after I paid. Of course I did not ask for her number ect… anyways, that was 2 months ago, and as she didn’t seem uncomfortable or anything, I kept going. 

Blah blah blah, recently someone else who worked there asked her if she likes me. She said “he’s cute,” and also said that I am “very shy,” which is very obvious… I heard this because I was at the table immediately around the corner. Anyways, I don’t know if I could ask her for her number or if that would be obnoxious, and if I could, if I could just do it with a note and get the hell out of dodge and don’t not come back unless she chooses to text me, but I simply don’t have a clue how to proceed or if I even should.

Throughout my teens/early 20s I had a lot of self-confidence issues. I went to an all-boys school so mixing with girls started at 16, right when I was a shell, filled with self-doubt, confusion and anxiety.  
   
Mid 20s I had somewhat conquered most of this, I trained regularly, I have a great body now, I also had dated a few times here and there. My first relationship was at 21, I was a rebound for a selfish slut. I was blinded by love (hopeless romantic) and ignored red flags that stared me in the face. After about 3 months of dating, she cheated on me with her ex. Broke me up but taught me a lot.   
  
At around 25 I met a girl on tinder, she was from Brazil, we liked each other a lot. This was still around the time I was reasonably confident in myself but still had a lot of doubts and emotional maturity, regarding relationships. Anyway after 4 months of dating she had to leave the country, never saw her again.   
  
I am now 29. I have been on a bunch of dates since, none of them went past a first date. I am not one to sleep around, I only sleep with girls I believe I could be with. 30 is around the corner and I have so much pressure on myself to find someone to share my life with because honestly, I don’t see how a life is worth living if not to live it with someone else.   
  
As it stands, I’m a much more confident person, I don’t really get nerves going on a date or talking to people.  
  
Over the past 3-4 weeks I’ve been dating this lovely girl, she’s cute, funny, laidback and every time we met things went so well. We slept together on the 4th date, and I cooked for her on the 5th, I was over the moon to be honest, it had been 4 years since my last girlfriend, and I could really see myself with this girl. Anyway, over the weekend she talked to me less and then started to ghost me. I asked her what was going on and she said, ‘you’re not what I am looking for’.  
   
I have a developed a strong emotional wall around myself but when it comes to relationships, I just hate it. I’m totally gutted right now; it seems like dating people is few and far between and finding a connection with someone is like a needle in a haystack. I’m yearning to love and to be loved, the fear of being alone any longer or finding the right person too late in life to enjoy things together is filling me with dread.   


I would literaly give someone the world, I would love and care for them, hold their heart in my hands and treat it better than my own... why am I finding so hard to find someone who wants and would do the same?  
  
What hope is there...

I hope you're doing well today. I'm here to open up about some personal struggles I'm facing and to seek guidance from this incredible community. As a young male in my 20's, I find myself dealing with feelings of insecurity, loneliness, anxiety, and depression.

Firstly, insecurity has been weighing me down lately, and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced similar feelings and how they were able to overcome them. Are there any strategies or techniques that have helped boost your self-esteem and confidence? I would appreciate any advice or personal stories you can offer in this regard.

Secondly, the weight of loneliness has been taking its toll on me. I'm curious to know how others have navigated this feeling and found meaningful connections. Do you have any suggestions, whether it's finding new hobbies, joining social groups, or maybe even trying a new approach to online networking?

Lastly, I'd like to touch on anxiety and depression. While I'm aware that seeking professional help is important, I'm interested to hear if any of you have found comfort in self-care practices, such as exercise, mindfulness, or creative outlets, that have helped alleviate these symptoms.

I truly appreciate any insights, stories, or resources you can share. Let's come together as a community and support one another through these challenging times. 

Thank you all in advance!",1695014478.0,anxiety

I 19(M) am in the high functioning range of the autism spectrum but I also have pretty severe ADD and a general anxiety disorder. I recently got diagnosed with depression which really isn’t a surprising but it hurt to confirm it. It makes me feel like even more of a broken human being. I haven’t had a true friend since probably elementary school. As I got older it became more apparent to others I’m not like everyone else. While they probably can’t tell why I think I tends to lead people to find me creepy or think I’m severely mentally disabled. I’m almost certain this is what caused most of my childhood friends to stop caring and talking to me much and in one case even come to hate me. I’ve never recovered since the end of middle school when it all burnt down. I’ve also not so much as been friends with a girl since maybe 3rd grade and the fact women tend to notice I’m different more easily it makes interaction even more difficult. Because of this I used to think I was asexual but then I finally had a crush on a coworker at my first job when I was 15. Someone told her how I felt and without me asking her out she said she wasn’t in a good place for relationships at the time. She started dating the pot head 2 weeks later. Because of all this I’ve missed out on pretty much every teen experience and now I think I won’t get any of the young adult ones either. I feel like I’ll be alone forever and having read stories and seen statistics about people like me that seems very likely. I wish I had a worse mental disability so at least I wouldn’t be aware how much my life sucks.,1676868866.0,anxiety

Now I’m really scared to put myself out there, I think a part of it is also because I’ve been bullied in school in the past so I have anxiety with going to school but going to school is pretty much the only way for me to make friends/see people my age on a consistent basis but my social anxiety makes it impossible for me to just interact with people normally. I always get extremely overwhelmed and scared especially when there’s a lot of people around.

Whenever I talk to people I find it extremely hard to just be myself because I’m terrified they’ll think I’m weird which just makes me end up sounding weird anyways since I’m so worried I’ll say something weird it becomes a self fulfilling omen. 

I don’t have any friends that I talk to other than this one old friend from the school I previously went to that I still keep in touch with but every time I talk to them I feel worse about myself since they often make fun of me because of the fact that I don’t have any other friends.

I don’t even remember the last time I got to invite friends to my birthday, it’s only ever me and my mom celebrating and I feel like a loser for having no friends to celebrate with. Every year I hope that my next birthday will be different and that I’ll have friends next year to celebrate with but every birthdays the same.

I get really depressed sometimes when I see social media posts from people I used to be close friends with having a normal life, posting pictures hanging out with friends, going to football games, etc. 

I know this is all my fault though because I usually just isolate myself instead of putting myself out there, I don’t really make that much of an effort to make new friends. I just isolate myself, the only person I really talk to consistently is my mom and I don’t even really get along that well with her",1692798743.0,anxiety

I'm happy to leave and fuck off my boss with style 'cause she treated me like a shit , but at the same time i'm terrified for my insecurities, i'm scared despite i have a little experience for this job.

My fear it's not to be capable enough. 

The same thought it goes for an art school, that i'm going to start it at septemeber, it reminds me my failures at high school, i was very immature and my dyscalculia didn't help as well, but i have taken my responsibilities about this.

I worked really hard for paying the courses, i have already studied in another school (Graphic Design) and passed the exams months ago, while I was working and studying, i was going also to a free psychotherapy (on a mental health place for youth) for a couple of months, because i can't afford a real therapy, it helped me to manage my stress but nothing more.

But now, i think i can't handle it anymore, i don't know if this anxiety it's a burn out sign, i want only to be strong and trying to make my dreams come true, i spent 10 years fantasize about my dream job and career, trying a lot of paths. I can't accept to fail.

I think around 19 I accepted that this would last forever, and in accepting it I became comfortable with it.

I turned 24 this month, and recently I've been feeling nothing but anxiety and sadness thinking about my loneliness, like I wish I could do a do-over, or manage to turn things around -- but at the same time it feels way too late for that. I'm thinking about all the experiences I never really got, I never was social in highschool, I never went to college, I never got to enjoy being outside hanging out during summer vacations, never had a girlfriend, never had a kiss...

This year I plan on taking some community college classes part-time while I work, I feel part of this plan is driven by my desire to experience that which I missed out on -- college life -- even though I know that this isn't the same experience at all as it will just be taking a couple of classes during the week, and I'm mainly doing it for pragmatic reasons, I can't help but feel this pull towards making up for what I missed out on with what little there is of my young adult hood, if mid-20's even counts as young adult still.

I wish I could go back to just being comfortable with my loneliness, but I'm feeling so much anxiety right now from it. For the past five years I was completely at peace with the concept of loneliness for my entire life, never doubting it, never really complaining about it, and now that's all crumbling at the moment. It feels like a mid-life crisis in my 20s, as I look around at younger people enjoying life, and experience things I never have and never will. And yet I am the youngest I will ever be again so I have to do something to mix things up. The past 3 years of my life have been a blur especially and I need to slow it down.",1686540799.0,anxiety

a bit of background, because, well, explaining with context might help(?): i'm single, never been married and don't have kids. i live alone. this isn't intended to sound like a dating ad, i swear! i took a sabbatical (quit) from a job that i was at for 9 years in 2017. i ended up traveling around the western US from (2017-2019) and lived out of a van. i bought a house in a mountain town that is fairly isolated in 2019. i lost my grandmother this month (she had dementia). a relationship that started at the beginning of this year ended recently. (if you could call it a relationship. she has/had no intention of being in a committed relationship with anyone.)

i currently don't work (severe depression/anxiety has been a major factor). COVID hasn't helped, obviously. i've always been the ""quiet"" one in groups, so i really don't get out that often (i'm definitely an introvert). being in a really really small rural town doesn't help. i'm pretty hard on myself when it comes to athleticism (i'm an ultrarunner, climber, and skier).

i've been through CBT/therapy. i've taken paxil, celexa, and wellbutrin. i'm not currently in therapy and/or on any prescription drugs.

these past 1+ months have been excruciatingly hard. i've slept away days/weeks. i've planned my suicide. i've had to call a crisis line. lately, i just cry. i wake up wanting to die. i go to sleep wanting to die. loneliness is not fun. not feeling connected to anyone is not fun. not experiencing joy is not fun. not enjoying ANYTHING is not fun.

none of my core values (authenticity, adventure, love, honesty, connection, freedom, peace) are being satisfied in relationships with family/friends, work, play/fun, or with my health.

i've looked through journal entries from twenty years ago and this search for contentment/happiness is a theme. it has been there from the beginning.

   My problem is that I can see everything wrong with myself but I hate myself too much to fix it. I don't have any motivation to be happy and socialize. I am young and fit (M24) so I shouldn't have any issues in socializing and dating but I am extremely self-conscious and very sensitive in sensing when someone doesn't like me.

I have my work colleagues that I am very open with, apart from those two I have no one else to talk to. Although I'm not this open with them, they don't know my mental struggles.

 When I'm on my sofa at night I look to the other end wishing someone was staring back but unfortunately that's just a fantasy, for now.

I don't have the confidence to chase a girl to win her over and without that I know my love life will struggle. I don't want someone just to have sex with purely for the sex as that isn't satisfying to me, I need love, I need the passion, I need the romance, I need that connection to be happy.

I have a 1year old son and I need to be happy for him, I need to be happy to make him happy but I'm afraid to get my heart broken again like his mother did to me but I also hate myself too much to be happy or to even try to be happy. I need that someone next to me in life, I can't cope by myself, in order to love myself I need that someone beside me but I'm too afraid of getting hurt again and I'm also too afraid of being a disappointment to someone.

I know what needs to be done to be happy but I'm refusing to let myself be happy both consciously and subconsciously. Maybe some anxiety pills wouldn't go amiss, do I really wanna go down that route? I don't think I do but maybe it's for the best, just to get me back on track.",1612990239.0,anxiety

281,3625.0,I have severe work anxiety.,6,ka2smt,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ka2smt/i_have_severe_work_anxiety/,4,"Hi. Like the title says, I (20F Korean-Canadian) have severe work anxiety. To give you some background info to understand my situation a bit better: 

I moved to London, UK, at the beginning of this year for work. I graduated culinary school in Baking and Pastry Arts, got recruited by a famous 5 star hotel company, and moved to London at 19 alone. In the beginning I was excited. But as soon as I moved there things were very difficult for me. Turns out the UK is more different from Canada than I expected. I was culture shocked and formed agoraphobia. 
I worked for around 2.5 months and then this pandemic hit, so I was in lockdown/quarantine for 5 months. All alone in my one room. I guess that’s where my fear started growing. I constantly thought about my skills and how I worked. I always felt like I was the only one that lacked skill in both baking and in being social and active at work. I never got to become close with my colleagues because of the short time, but also because I am very introverted. Everyone in the kitchen seemed so professional, passionate, and friendly with each other except me because I’m very new. I constantly compared myself to them. I felt left out the more I thought of it, not because of them, but because I felt alienated. Like (literally) I was really a foreigner. I’m the only asian person and also the youngest, everyone else is older than me by 10+ years, so the cultural and generational gap felt so big. I was alone in the world with no family nor friends to come back home to after a hard day. I was so homesick. 

So because of all this, I basically spent my whole time in lockdown torturing myself and my mental health by thinking of all the things I lack, the things people at work would say/said to me that probably meant nothing but I overthought, I would think that everyone hates working with me because I just suck, and most importantly thinking about what the main executive chef thinks of me. If you know anything about the food industry, you would know it’s one of the most stressful and pressuring type of work for all physical, mental, and emotional health. Because of these self deprecating thoughts, I thought I was going crazy. I cried everyday and night. 

Then later on, the chef called me and said I would have to come back in for reopening work soon. I had a major anxiety attack thinking of going back to work and being in that pressuring situation again. 
The day of the reopening came and I was at work. I could feel my brain going haywire. I went to work for a week during reopening and I cried every morning and night going and coming from work. I dreaded going to work and I was so stressed and anxious constantly that at one point I threw up near the time I was supposed to close. I left early that day and just sat in the train and started bawling my eyes out without a care if there were other passengers or not. I finally decided to get help. I talked to my doctor, got diagnosed with GAD, depression, and OCD. I called my mom to tell her what happened and she immediately said to take a holiday and come back home. I decided to contact the main chef while crying and he said to take a couple days thinking of what I want to do. I got a doctors note saying I am not suitable for work and to take 12 weeks off. So I did and also booked my holidays, and came back home to Canada. 

Presently, today is my last day here in Canada. I was supposed to return to London December 23rd, because that’s when my holiday ends. But no. The hotel management contacted me and told me I need to be in for work on Christmas. I told them I would be returning the 23rd, and will have to quarantine for two weeks when I arrive. They said I can’t and need to be at work for Christmas, so to rebook my flights so I can go back to London, quarantine, and be at work on Christmas. I was so shocked because I already got approval for my holidays before I came here, and they all know that we need to quarantine when we come back. I already dreaded going back to London because I was so happy finally after long days of mental exhaustion from work, seeing my family and friends and stress free. But when they said I need to come back ASAP I felt my heart literally shatter. Told my mom about it and started to cry and rebooked my tickets. Even as Im writing this post, I am anxious thinking that today is the last day and I will be on the plane back to work tomorrow. 

You may be thinking, if it’s that bad then just quit. But for me, quitting is something I don’t want to do. I was the one who begged my parents to let me go and I am the one on this career path. This hotel is a very well known name in this industry and can get me anywhere and more opportunities in the future. My pride is too high and also I don’t want to disappoint my parents because they told me to just bare for the last year (my contract for work is two years), which I do agree on. 
I just think that if I have some less working time, I will be able to manage myself better. Which is why I’m thinking if I should ask to reduce my hours in half, instead of working full time everyday. But I also don’t want my pay to change because I don’t want my parents to find out I am working less after taking 12 weeks off from work, and also I would not be able to afford rent. But at the same time I’m not sure if it would change because my contract and payment states I am receiving money salary wise, not hourly. Does that mean no matter how little or how long I work, I still get paid the same? All these thoughts are in my head and I don’t know what to do. I want to go half hours but if the pay is less then I would have to continue full time. But then I would not be able to manage my mental health. 

I really feel alone in this because nobody around me my age is working, and are having fun with each other in university, partying, eating out, having money from their rich parents. It makes me feel as if I am alone dealing with “adulthood” while my friends can, obviously not relax (because I know uni is also hell), but can at least be here with each other :(  

This was long, thank you so much for those who read until the end. Please let me know what you think I should do.",1607554668.0,anxiety
282,3638.0,Breakup trauma & being unable to move on?,2,12dhz6y,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/12dhz6y/breakup_trauma_being_unable_to_move_on/,5,"Let's cut right to the chase: I (M38) have, yet again, certain problems with moving on from a breakup that was so traumatic and painful, it haunts me up until this day. What happened?

I count at least six ex partners who have cheated on me, some of them abusing me in other ways, too. So from my teenage years up until my mid 20s I suffered from severe trust issues. Went to therapy and kept on fighting for years, hoping to regain my trust in women after all that messed up stuff that happened. Which, for whatever reason, I managed to do repeatedly. I am quite surprised about how much setbacks my younger self managed to take...

When I turned 30, I met someone I'd like to call ""Marge"" here. Marge really seemed different: Like me, she unfortunately had to deal with abusive ex partners and I still vividly remember how we first kissed after opening up to one another about our vulnerabilities and fears of getting hurt by yet another (wo)man. What followed were some 5 awesome years: I bonded with her in a way I never bonded with any of my ex partners before, then bonded with her family, eventually found a house, moved in with Marge, went on so many adventures, traveled almost two dozen countries, yadda yadda. Everything seemed perfect, and I honestly thought all of those years that this time I really did get lucky. For a long time I was convinced that she might be ""the one"" - for years she was so different to all of those disgusting people who betrayed me in my past, broke my trust and worse.

Then one day, at age 35, I get this call from the hospital: ""It is about your brother..."", they said. I remember getting there as fast as I could - just to find out that he already had passed. I had no chance to say goodbye and naturally I went into a state of severe and deep grief. Until this day, I remember so vividly how difficult it was to simply get out of bed or to eat, for example. As I always was a fighter and survivor, I promised both Marge and myself that I'll do anything in my power to get back on my feet again - so I went to see a psychologist again, agreed to take medication and what not. I mean yeah, I was in a really bad place - but if you got some support and feel as if your partner really sticks to your side, you take whatever step you are mentally and physically capable of taking, right? What happened next I still cannot comprehend until this day:

Within less than a week, Marge went from her usual, caring ""I do love you and I got your back, you are my man and we will get through this"" to that one sentence I cannot get out of my head until this day: ""Tomorrow I'll come pick up my stuff"". In retrospect I know that her decision to leave must have been premeditated, because right after she took her belongings, she immediately had another apartment set up in another town close to mine. Nobody manages to both search for and sign contracts for an apartment within 24 hours...  I kept asking for an explanation for this seemingly sudden 180° turn, and all I ever got from her was: ""It is the dynamics..."" Spent days and weeks thinking about what she could have meant, and all that ever came to my mind is this: Yeah, I haven't been fully present for some 8 to 10 odd weeks, because I had to bury my damn brother for f...'s sake! And that's about it - haven't done anything wrong to her, never let my frustration out on her, didn't yell or whatever. When I had my bad ""episodes"", I just isolated myself for the time I needed to cry or vent or whatever. All I needed her to do is to actually live by her words and have my back.

But this isn't even the most painful thing, because: Yeah, we all are free and as I truly understand that, I logically did not stand in her way. Still she took much more from me than just our relationship. She ruined my trust and, in her own way, lined up with those other women who simply don't have the dedication I bring to the table myself. And I honestly mean it when I say that I do not understand this until this very day: How can you know somebody for half a decade to see that very person turn into someone completely different over night? How is it that people keep ripping out your heart, destroying everything you built? See, that's not just about me keeping her as a girlfriend: Because of her decision, she took her family from me, too. Those folks were like blood to me. Hell, her mother even called me right after Marge picked up her stuff and cried, begging me to forgive her daughter. Let that sink in: Her own mother thought that she, thanks to Marge's decision, had to plead before me. I don't know if any of you folks can relate, but to me this was yet another huge blow because now Marge even wronged her own mother. I remember telling her mom like a dozen times that there is no need for her to apologise and to cry, and that she should take good care of Marge. Eventually I got a letter from her mom on my birthday, stating that she's missing ""her son from another mom"". Let that sink in...

Next to that, Marge ruined the vision of a shared future as such. She f....ed up her chance to be with someone different to her abusers. Within a moment, that dream of two people with quite some baggage turning out just fine went POOF. There was a chance to treat each other in a way different to most people treat each other - and Marge f....ed that up, too. For my thing I know I did treat her differently, cause guess what: I meant it when I told her that I love her unconditionally. After all, that's true love, isn't it? Did not matter if she looked stunning and all dressed up, ready to go to a fancy restaurant, or whether she just crawled out of the sheets looking like an even fuzzier version of Edward Scissorhands. Did not matter if she had a great day or got stuck in her own head (she experienced abuse herself, her two ex partners really did her wrong...). Even in her worst days, I loved this woman. Which is why I let her leave in the first place without causing a scene or standing in her way.

Still here I am, still trying to make sense of what happened, cause everything feels as if the ""new"" Marge murdered that woman I was with for such a long time. Not sure if anyone can relate here, but I cannot find other words to describe how I feel. It is a really bizarre sensation, cause when I see Marge's face, it looks like the face woman I loved but also like some stranger who also happened to mess up my heart and mind. The sensation is really surreal. I really struggle understanding what happened. Anyway...

After that I spent almost 2 years to pull myself up by my bootstraps again. I cannot even count how many nights I woke up crying, feeling so alone and broken that those thoughts about suicide kept crawling up my spine again. I kept fighting the urge to act on these thoughts, and I went to see my psychologist more often than usual. As I said, I am a survivor and a fighter, always have been - quitting is no option, even when ending myself seemed really, really attractive. And when I managed to feel somewhat alive again after some months, the next big punch in the face happened: 

I heard that Marge got right into a rebound shortly after she tossed me like a fruit. And lo and behold: Just months after that, this a...hole who took over my spot at the dinner table and in the sheets assaulted her. Let that sink in: This woman had a perfectly fine man who treated her right for years, all AFTER she already had been abused by two other men. Still she left to try her luck elsewhere and, as a result, got hurt herself yet again. And all because of ego, cause what other reason did she have to leave? Exactly, none. All of that misery could have been prevented. As I said: This isn't just about me and my own bruised ego, but about everyone involved. The damage caused by Marge's decision does not only affect me, but also her family as well as herself, as we see. And I just cannot grasp why. Every day I ask myself: Why did she do this? Why did she not just stay in a fine home? Hell, if I was a dick I could just think of her as another stupid and depraved individual and be bitter, but I am not: In fact I am devastated in so many ways, because none of that sh\*t, including the violence she experienced with that new guy of hers, ever had to happen if she simply would have stayed. All of that crap could have been prevented - all but the death of my brother.

So yeah, that's years in the past now. And even though I am getting better and do my best to look forward, I must admit that despite years of effort, treatment and doing the best to my ability to get well, a big part of me just is not okay. To make matters even worse: Recently Marge reached out to me, sending me a letter. I have never read anything like her words: Her letter was a manifest of regret. If there is any chance for her to undo what she'd done, she asked. I assume that the blurred ink stains must have been the result of her tears dropping onto the paper while she was writing. And I would like to believe her, but because of her actions, I cannot. She has gone too far by doing the very thing she knew was a dealbreaker for me: Abandoning me. Again, all of that sh\*t could have been prevented so easily, but she did what she did. So logically she cannot make all of that sh\*t disappear. Something I learned to handle somewhat. What I cannot handle though: That we both are messed up now for no reason at all, and that there is no way back.

I guess that is why I keep preaching to people that they got to stop talking the talk and must start walking the walk. I mean I can do that, too: Not a single time in my life did I cheat or abandon somebody I loved. Never. Doesn't make me perfect - I am just human like everybody else. But at least I truly respect and care for my loved once and am a man of integrity. Yet the older I get, the more I seem to understand that such love and dedication is something one cannot expect from the majority of people on this planet. People constantly use whatever slight inconvenience they experience as an excuse to abandon others. It seems as if they never see the bigger picture and as if they don't understand what matters in life - loyalty and unconditional love are two of these things. And as we can see, everybody loses whenever someone fails to see that bigger picture.

Nothing makes sense. I really cannot comprehend what happened. 

And I know that this has to do with my own trauma and all - but I fear it will never go away. 38 years of life, some 20 odd years of bad experiences, and then this one thing that seemed to be different just turns out to be the cherry on top of that sh\*t cake called life.

I really do not know what do do. I feel so lost. And I wish there was a chance to turn back time, but there never is...",1680782341.0,trauma
283,3660.0,Childhood trauma & neglect has consumed my life.,3,ix5ivx,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ix5ivx/childhood_trauma_neglect_has_consumed_my_life/,0,"I guess I should start from the beginning.. This post will be long but I can’t afford a therapist and I’ve kept this all bottled up for 21 years because I have no one to talk to & don’t want to burden anyone. My mother suffers from severe manic bipolar and narcissism. She was very mentally & emotionally abusive to me throughout my childhood. I am the second born of 4 children, I received the most neglect and abuse from her. My father is a great man. I truly think he has a great heart, but he was never emotionally available to me & my siblings. He has endured my mother’s abuse for 25 years and has always put her needs before ours. I don’t really blame him for his part of the neglect, but sometimes I find myself wishing he had cared more about us kids.. Enough to divorce her and keep us safe. But he was trapped in her mental abuse and I feel incredibly bad for him. I was molested when I was 5-6 years old by someone at my church, & I didn’t tell anyone for 11 years. When I finally told my mom 11 years later, she said she already knew. My first serious boyfriend had some family issues of his own, so he moved in with me when I was a freshman in HS. We dated for almost 2 years, cheated on me the whole entire relationship, with many girls, including with my mother. I had such abandonment & self-worth issues from my childhood traumas, I didn’t even break up with him. He broke up with me. I begged him to stay. That’s the beginning of my pathetic relationship history. My senior year of HS, my mother texted me while I was at school, & told me she was about to commit suicide & that I needed to take care of my family. I spent the whole day speaking to counselors & police officers & my dad, trying to figure out where my mom was & what to do. She ended up being fine, but she spent a month inpatient at a mental support hospital. Meanwhile, my dad had to juggle 3 jobs to make up for my mom’s missing income, & I had to balance 2 jobs, high school, & taking care of my two siblings in elementary school. I was in national honors society, graduated with a 4.0, & none of my peers at school even knew what I went through at home. The school made me talk to my counselor once a week after what happened with my mom, but I never knew what to say. It’s as if I had gotten so used to my fucked up life that I was numb to it. I graduated in 2017, I’m now 21 years old & never went to college because I had no time to prepare for my future while dealing with all of my mothers issues. I was always friendly with people in my high school, but I never formed any real close friendships. The only real close friend I ever had, her father passed away of cancer our sophomore year, & our friendship became very strained and we faded away. I have been in a few romantic relationships, but none of them ever loved me. I have terrible taste in men, and most of the guys I’ve been with formed a strange obsession with me, but it was never love. Always just physical lust & obsession. My grandpa got diagnosed with cancer when I had first graduated high school, & I tried to break up with my boyfriend at the time to be able to take care of my dad in such a hard time for him.. When I told him we needed to break up, he lied to me & said he had testicular cancer to get me to stay with him.. This is just one of the many strange & scary things boys have said/done to me. I am now 21 and just feel so alone in every sense. I’ve been with my current boyfriend for 2 years this month. We have lived together for a year now. He claims to love me, says he cares about me, holds me while I cry about never having a mother or anyone to love & nurture me, but he’s emotionally unavailable. He’s the only guy I have ever been with that hasn’t cheated on me, & that’s the main thing I hold onto in our relationship. Besides him not cheating, he repeatedly hurts me over & over again, neglecting my needs & leaving me trapped in the same cycle I had with my mom. He is such a good person. He has a good heart. But he suffers from bipolar as well, & severe depression. I’ve stayed by his side for 2 years, but he repeatedly goes days without hugging or kissing me, has never gone out of his way to do anything special for me, and just all over shows no interest in me. He apologizes, then continues neglecting me. I love him, & I care about him, but at some point it feels abusive & manipulative. I don’t think he’s purposely manipulating me, but it feels so similar to the relationship I had with my mom. Begging for them to love me, & never receiving it. I think I might be cursed. To be unlovable forever. I naturally am a very nurturing and loving person, I want to save everyone & make everyone happy. But I want someone to be that for me. I don’t want to be strong anymore, I want to be able to break & have someone there to show me I am not unlovable. But I’m starting to lose out hope that I will ever get that feeling. The only reason I haven’t offed myself yet is my younger siblings. They give me purpose to live. Thankfully my mom has improved IMMENSELY since I was younger, & she isn’t quite as abusive or neglectful to them anymore. But I created great bonds with them as I cared for them when they were little. I just crave the feeling of safety & love & support. I crave it so much. In a friend, or a boyfriend.. Anything. All of this trauma in my childhood has left me feeling lost & empty. I’ve been taking care of everyone for so long.. I just want to be taken care of for once. I don’t even know the point of making this post. Maybe just to see if anyone understands or feels the same way? Sometimes it feels like I’m all alone in this world & that no one on this earth could ever understand me or love me. Can anyone out there see me? Or am I invisible forever?",1600711018.0,trauma

I don’t really know where to start with this so I’ll just go straight in, ever since I was 14 I’ve had someone I can rely on. I started dating a boy and we were together for 2 years and he really did a number on me. I won’t go into it too much but it was overall a very toxic relationship at such a young age and was the biggest mistake of my life because it’s shaped me into the person I am now which I don’t like.  He hurt me over and over but I was attached to him and I was scared to be alone because I don’t (and never really have) have many friends at all. When we broke up I was crushed and I became close with this other boy I knew at the time. It was never anything romantic I didnt see it that way but he did, he began getting feelings for me and I tried acting dumb and ignoring it because I didn’t wanna lose him. He confessed his feelings to me multiple times and I made it clear I don’t feel the same and we each time decided to continue being friends. We were friends for a few years and he gradually started doing this thing where he’d say he didn’t wanna be friends with me then ask to be friends again, I was crushed each time because he means the world to me I can’t see my life without him. Fast forward to recent times and we stopped being friends again because I got into a relationship, although a few days ago I ended that relationship because no matter how hard I try I just don’t feel that love there or deep connection. I don’t get excited to see him or anything so I ended it. Now I’m alone and I haven’t been this alone in a very long time but I don’t wanna use people just to fill that void of loneliness. I don’t know how to deal with being completely by myself.",1698271642.0,trauma

I’m posting this in part to receive advice, but also because I need the space to talk about my loneliness in a way I don’t feel like I can in my real-life.

I’m 34, non-binary, Black, and recently married. My wife is amazing and we have such a full life together. We have shared friends and we are always traveling or having a day/night out. We both work from home and it’s great. But I’m deeply lonely and longing for meaningful friendships.

Throughout my childhood/teens, I never really had close friends because I suffered abuse at home so I felt a lot of shame and kept people at arms length so that no one would know. As a young adult, I used drugs to cope with my trauma so I missed out on the formative years of developing friendships in college and young adulthood. I got sober in AA in my early 20s, but the community was very white and I just didn’t fit in. I also went back to school, but by that time, I was in my mid-20s and a bit too old to form relationships with the 18-22 year olds. In grad school, I was still working through much of the trauma of my early years and I felt like I didn’t know how to deeply connect with people to form meaningful relationships. I’ve also never been close with my family because they engage ina lot of toxic behavior that does not align with how I live my life. 

So all that has left me where I am now — in my mid-30s without close friends. I have people that I spend time with (including two friends who my wife and I consider family) and some friend I see 1x/year who live in other states, but on the day to day, no one texts or calls. No one (other than my wife) sends a funny TikTok or asks me to meet up for a drink. My wife has such a full circle of close friends who are constantly in contact and I just feel so embarrassed that I can’t seem to find even one person who wants to be my close friend. I’ve taken classes to try to meet people, used Bumble BFF, but I can’t seem to find anyone. I’ve done a lot of work to learn to be vulnerable in friendships and now that I’m able to do that, it feels too late. 

I feel like there’s just no where in the world where I fit. Any advice (or even just acknowledgement) is much appreciated. Thanks for reading.",1696802624.0,trauma

So… to keep it less triggering and more on point, I’m going to try to boil it down to main points. Stick with me here, for a mini timeline for reference. Also I’m 29F.

1. Born into mental illness, extreme family trauma and abuse, and poverty. 

2. Contracted viral meningitis at 6 months, got a TBI that wasn’t picked up on until 20+ years old.

3. Good to note that my mother started me in therapy consistently at 10. 

4. Homeless after family explosion

5. Used as a token to play tug of war with from all adults, while under 18. None of needs met.

6. Graduated high school, was extremely ill with mental disorders that manifest physically, yadda yadda. 

7. Placement in various hospitals and programs

8. Learned that I learn differently and poured everything into my college education. I graduated with a BA. 

9. Other people almost took my life.

10. The last hospital, they gave me ECT, Electroconvulsive therapy. 

11. I have been trying to understand, re learn, and live life again, but now with persistent everyday short term memory loss, Aphasia, and some long term memory loss. As well as initial problems, including emotional dysregulation.   
——

So basically that list gives a teeny tiny bit of background. I was always a people pleaser to survive. I’ve been in and out of many treatments, always do therapy. 

I used to be able to do so many things. I was incredibly smart. I worked very hard and put in blood, sweat, and tears. 

But it was making me crazy because of all of the underlying trauma. 

It came to an emergent head, and the only option given to me was ECT, I have gone through all other options. 

The point of this post is that I am more isolated than I have ever been in life. 

I try to talk about things and have memory issues, then emotional issues, and it’s gone. 

Writing seems easier because I can take an hour to write, like in this post, use google for words, etc.

When things come back in my memory that I was trying to talk about before, I can’t interrupt others, once I can talk, it’s gone. 

Things make me cringe hard that didn’t used to, like too much light, noise, anything..and I can’t think. The TBI from childhood got worse, but now I can’t work so I have state insurance and cannot get into a neuropsych, for an updated scan. 

I was really great (from working really hard) at public speaking and worked in customer service for animal medical care. 

Now I can’t hold normal conversations. I don’t know how to talk without letting people know just the tip of the iceberg, of why I talk differently. 

But of course, when meeting someone, you don’t tell them your frikkin life story or traumas, so I have no idea where to start.

Sentences come out of my mouth and kind of make sense. It makes the most sense to people who knew me before.

I don’t know how to make friendships or date anymore. I’m so freaking lonely. It’s been 1 year and 6 months since that treatment. 

Any advice on how to talk to people? I want to be able to date again. I want to have multiple friends again.",1682361965.0,trauma

But I chickened out.

Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them.

Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it.

I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done.

Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love.
Fuck.

I didn't really think I'd do it. But I went for it. I was planning it for a while and waited until my parents were out. I'm 17 and still in education so I still live with my parents. They were going out for something to drink with friends. I ordered Pizza and ate. I wanted to have my favourite food before ya know... killing myself. It was probably around 10pm and I finished with my note. I made like 40 attempts at it... I wanted it to be perfect.

I left the house with my College ID card so when the found me they would know who I was and left with my phone too. Now taking my phone was stupid because of Snapchat... with its weird map feature, I completely forgot about that... 

Anyway I walked to my nearest bridge and that's when I received my first phone call. My mum. I declined and put my phone on silent. I continued walking and made it to a motorway bridge. It was late so no one was using it and it was dark too. For some weird reason I decided to check my phone, I don't know why. I had messages from nearly all my family, friends. Everyone. Even my younger sister. At that point I pretty much just broke down. 

Yeah... crying on the middle of the motorway bridge while cars zoomed under me. I knew then I had to do it. I climbed over the railing and sat on top of it. I was terrified. It was really terrifying. I had the belief it would be peaceful knowing I would be leaving behind a load of pain and hate but nope. Because of my fear I was just sitting there looking down. I wanted to do it but my body refuses to move. 

Remember when I said it was stupid of me taking my phone... well my mum called the police and used Snapchat to track me. I never use the maps feature so I forgot about it entirely. As a result the police came to me. There was around 3 or 4 I can't remember. They came behind me and tried to get me to shuffle back. I didn't do anything other than tell them to go away. 

They ended up grabbing me and yanking me off the railing and restrained me. They forced me off the bridge and sectioned me. If you don't know what that means just Google it because I can't be arsed to explain it. 

I got evaluated and all that fun stuff and after 24 hours got sent home. I got home visits from a mental health team and I'm being placed into a mental health service. But I hate that... If I had just decided to not write a note... I would be gone. I still feel the same way but don't have another shot at it. Everyone knows and I'm constantly being watched. If I do get better then that's good. But right now... I just want to die. I regret writing that note so much.",1578377297.0,suicide

Since I was a teenager I've had ""casual"" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go ""I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier"" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think ""you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head."" I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like ""yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!""

This has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently I've been thinking about how fucked up it is. And I feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode.

I just found out my little sister has been cutting herself and recently took and overdose and has a few weeks ago...

She potentially on the spectrum (super intelligent and aware also very introverted, socially awkward in certain situations etc) 
and has super extreme periods that also means extreme PMS every month.

Also another major issue is she lives alone with my mother who has BPD and living with that alone is very hard. It's an extremely volatile relationship. She's in her room alone online alot and shes into (special interest)  niche 'emo' bands that talk about suicide and things like that. My mother can be strict but also when trying to discipline doesnt have much control - i.e confiscating her phone - she will find it...

I'm older (26) and have moved out, I try to stay in touch regularly  but it's been hard past year or so as she got into teenage years and she doesn't often respond to messages/answer my calls.

Hello, this is my first time posting here. I just needed my opinion and wanted to be heard. I’m turning 23 in December. I’ve done college and currently working. I’m a bubbly person I’d say. I often make jokes with my friends and siblings. Some of my friends called me “happy virus” because my laugh was contagious. Funny right? Like you wouldn’t notice I have depression. 
When I was a kid I experienced verbal and physical abuse from my parents, especially from my mom. We moved to Canada around 2017, at that time I was only 16 years old. I’d say I’m not open and close to my parents as they were always building a wall with us. I have 2 siblings and I am the oldest child. I love my siblings and I wouldn’t trade them for anything else. During my teenage days in our own country, I developed depression because of my mommy issues. There was a time I overdosed myself with different pills. Luckily, I just passed out and woke up with purple lips and pale skin. I was triggered by my mom’s words back then. That time, they went to church and she didn’t want me to come ‘cause “Demons are not allowed in the church” referring to me. All that because I helped my friend do her school project and I was past curfew at that time. I didn’t notice the time and mind you my friend's house it’s just next to our house.

Fast forward,
Everything changed in Canada except I still have a curfew and they were still strict but the abuse wasn’t as bad as before. There were times that my mom still verbally abused us but I guess it wasn’t that bad. Idk. But I was so depressed here and there were times that my mom would body shaming me. 2nd suicide attempt happened. And then another one because I was overwhelmed with everything, school, family issues, work, financial problems, etc. I was diagnosed with severe depression, PTSD, and an eating disorder. 

I just want everything to stop….


Til I met this guy, suddenly I was happy again. I was slowly putting myself back together. Self-harming wasn’t there anymore. I told him everything including my past. I promised him I wouldn’t do stupid things again. Also, I tried to be open with my mom. I tried to be close to her. I introduced this guy to my mom as my “boyfriend”, and she said it’s okay, ‘cause I’m old enough to have one. I was really happy hearing those words. I hang out a lot with my boyfriend, sometimes I brought my little sister to our date just because I felt that she was bored in our house too. Everything was okay til one time my mom got mad at me because I spent too much outside and she said that I didn’t even care about them, but that was not the truth. I cared about them all the time it’s just I’m enjoying myself.

So my boyfriend told me that it’s okay he can just come over to our house and hang out with me. So every day my boyfriend will come over and spend the night with me because he works in the morning. He’ll bring some food and stuff. Everything was okay, I asked my mom a few times if it was okay with her. She said it’s okay but he can’t stay past midnight. So again, my boyfriend adjusted his visiting time. He would go home around 11 p.m. ‘Til yesterday my mom was so upset at me. She wanted me to drive her in Walmart but it took me a long time to get ready ’cause I was talking to my boyfriend on the phone that time. She was so mad that she threw things everywhere and yelled to my siblings “I want to kill myself, just kill me, just kill me!!!” I felt so sorry and so bad that my siblings got to hear those words. My mom yelled and called me several times “hoe” because I spent too much time with my boyfriend every day.

I don’t know what to do anymore. When I’m in my room reading books. She will calls me out for reading and spending too much time in books. When I go out with my friends, she will calls me out again for being such a hard-headed person because I spend too much with my friends and now. THIS. 

I pretty much cook for my family almost every day, doing house chores, and giving my mom money, every time my paycheque comes. I tried everything to be a perfect daughter to her. But I think it wasn’t enough… 

I don’t know where to place myself here at home. I don’t even know if I should call this place home anymore. It’s like I’m living in hell. I’m not allowed to be happy otherwise my mom will calls me out again. Do i have tights to get mad at my mom? Can i atleast for once yell at her? Idk what to do anymore… Help… I tried self-harming again.",1693210378.0,suicide

When i was young i felt my safe place is the bathroom, cos all i can hear is water pouring down to the bucket, no fighting. I live in the philippines that’s why we always have bucket inside the bathroom.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me.

If you reveal anything to adults, their immediate train of thought is: ""You're a kid, you don't even have to work yet.  What is there to worry about in school? Gee, I wish I was your age again because everything was so simple back then. Kids these days complain about the smallest things..."" and etc.

This attitude is exacerbated by the teens who jump on the ""mental health is now trendy"" bandwagon. They self-diagnose as depressed because every so often they get a bit sad or lazy. The kids who self-harm not as a coping mechanism but as a means of getting attention piss me off the most. Feel free to downvote, I know self-harm is a serious issue and I used to do it too, but I'm talking about the ones who do it purposely in visible places and aren't actually suffering from mental illness.

I'm never the first one to talk about my experiences with mental health, but if it comes up, I sometimes feel the need to clarify that I was diagnosed by a professional because SO MANY teens are self-diagnosing using those BS mental health tests online, then using those scores to show off. It's embarrassing.

Welp, that was my generalized rant about feeling marginalized as an actually depressed teen.

EDIT: it’s been a while and probably no one will see this, but I’ve gotten a lot of comments that made me reconsider some things. I’m not changing the wording of the original post, just adding on. 

1. Regarding self-harm: when I was writing this post, I got a bit heated because I remembered how my sister cut herself for attention when I was younger and it hurt a lot of people. I let those experiences color my view, and I could’ve been more sensitive to the issue. I know that those who self-harm for attention still have underlying problems if they’re willing to resort to such extremes. I just don’t like how it is portrayed as “trendy”. Some kids use cut marks as accessories while many people with depression try their best to hide them and were in a truly dark place when they made those scars.

2. I can’t say this enough: teens who are struggling in mental health but don’t have official diagnoses are still 100% valid. I was that teen a few years ago. I was scared of being dramatic, unsure if I were actually depressed, and unable to get a diagnosis for a while. I was only annoyed at the kids who know they aren’t affected by mental health but think it’s cool and use “fake deep” as a personality trait. 
3. This entire rant reads as me putting myself on a moral high horse, and I acknowledge I sound quite a bit like an ass. Uh yeah I have nothing else to say about that, other than I’m bad at conveying my actual tone through words.",1583020775.0,mental_disorder
321,4290.0,"M20, Do I have ADHD or some other mental disorder?",1,qmxqkm,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qmxqkm/m20_do_i_have_adhd_or_some_other_mental_disorder/,0,"There's a lot of factors in my life that has led me to believe I have ADHD: my depression, my social life, lifelong abuse from my mom. I've never been diagnosed, but I'm acutely aware of my depression. The symptoms line up with what I experience daily: irritation, anger, sleeping problems, lack of motivation, lack of self-confidence, negative self image, forgetfulness, lack of hygiene, thoughts of suicide (don't worry, it's stayed as thoughts for entertainment and not anything I plan to commit). I also have trouble paying attention and remembering certain details from conversations and within my surroundings. I overthink a lot, too. This is a problem that persists in my social life.

My overthinking makes me look over things that others can see, whenever I try not to overthink I either end up overthinking more or not thinking enough to not notice things others can see. Sometimes when instructions are given to me, my understanding gets in the way of properly doing what's been said. And the thing is, I have no awareness that I'm overthinking, thinking too little, or my understanding of certain directions are wrong until someone points it out. If I'm looking over a website or having to fill in sensitive information, I tend to read too quickly and scroll through pages really quickly. (For some reason, I can still read a book without rushing through it.) When people say certain things, instructional or conversation wise, that is not too specified, it's easy for me to get lost in the loop. It's hard to keep up with context clues. If I'm sitting with a group of people in a loud restaurant, it's like my auditory processing has been swapped. Like, secondary noises like the loud music and other nearby conversations takes over primary noises like someone talking from beside me. It's like watching a movie where the soundtrack overpowers the actors' voices, but in real life. (Just recently, it's become harder for me to comprehend actors words', so I've been watching my movies/shows with subtitles.) Even if its not a loud environment, but listening to children talking, people with accents talking, talking really fast, and people with low, deep bassed, and scratchy voices talking to me it's all unintelligeable whereas others can perfectly understand them. 

As for my lifelong abuse from my mom: She's emotionally and physically abusive. When I was 8-13 years old, my mom would threaten to stab me or herself as a discipling tactic so I could stop crying and listen to her. She would do this using a kitchen knife, and I'd have nowhere to run and no one to hide behind while she did so. Recently, the abuse has transitioned to her not respecting me for the young adult I am. She still talks over me, interrupts me, takes away some of my basic freedoms, and still hits me. She's a tough love parent, as well, meaning she easily gets upset and mad at me whenever I fail to pay attention to my surroundings and following instructions clearly. No matter how much she stresses for me to do so, I still fail whether it be a mistake or a simple misunderstanding, or any of the previous problems I listed above that I seemingly have no control over. Out of all the times my mom has stressed these things on me, never has she thought to get me tested or take me a therapist or specialist. She believes there's nothing wrong with me. Whenever I do fail to pay attention to certain things, or my mind feels like its on autopilot at times, my mom would always say, ""You scare me whenever you do that! And I know there's nothing wrong with you!"" When she tries to get me to understand something, she easily gets mad. Last time, she even said, ""I refuse to believe my son is this mentally challenged to understand this one simple thing!"" I have mentioned to her a handful of times that I want to speak to a therapist or see a specialist. She always says ""Ok, that's something we can definetly look into doing."" she never brings it up afterward. I think she doesn't want me talking about her to other people, and the abuse I've had to endure from her all my life. But, if I don't speak to a specialist soon I don't think I'll ever receive the closure I need for recovery. So for all the mistakes my mind makes, and all the times I neglect my hygiene and oversleep, my mom is not going to take those things are wake-up calls anytime soon. I don't understand, do I need to purposely act out or go on a mental rampage in order for her to give me the help I need? It's gotten at a point that my thinking and speaking is not correlating correctly. Like, I read the number 4. I have the number 4 in my head. And I intend to say the number 4. But what leaves my mouth is 624 or something completely different than what my mind meant to say. There's a few moments I've confused left for right. And I'm in driving lessons currently, so there's been a handful of times I've confused left for right. It feels like my mind is deteriorating and I don't know what to do. Is this ADHD, ADD, or some other mental disorder? Is it just my depression worsening? Am I on the autistic spectrum? Could it be a combination of everything?

Before I wrap this up, I hear that these kind of mental disorders are commonly associated with intelligent people. I wouldn't call myself intelligent by any means, but I am an artist and writer who has been given awards for some of my writing and art in the past. I'm writing a book series, first volume of which I just self-published. You can determine whether that intelligence may include ""creative intelligence"" or not. Also, I stutter.

In fact, I can't really seem to be worried about much anymore, just whatever doesn't involve me. If it's someone else suffering, I want to help, but I can't push myself to help myself. 

I went to therapy a few years ago and she thought I might actually be on the spectrum to a degree. I do check some boxes to be fair to her, I wouldn't be surprised if I am slightly autistic. I also have a sneaky suspicion that my depression might be passively fueled by undiagnosed ADHD or one of its variants. So many things about me from when I was younger line up with these possible disorders and maybe even others too. 

I'm not here to give a deep dive into my head, I'm not ready for that to be attached to my profile forever, but I do wonder if it's worth trying to get to the bottom of all this. I suffered some serious abuse as a child that I denied myself accepting as abuse and couldn't process for a very long time because of that attitude to it, so that definitely plays a factor in who I am now. At my age, in my position in life as a (failing) University student, is it worth even trying to diagnose anything concrete like a disorder? I don't even know where to begin that journey if I do decide to follow it. 

Anyone else here who got a diagnosis later in life, or went through the testing process later in life, did any of it make a difference? Is it something I should look into? I'm not convinced it's worth it just to state my curiosity, but it would be nice to have a defined answer of why everything is so damn hard and why I always seem to need that extra push, that extra bit of effort and work to do what others can seem to do easily.",1674669865.0,mental_disorder

Before I start I need to get say This person may very well have a lot of real problems I'm not dismissing that this is all just a thought exercise...

\[Person A partner of 2 years to a best friend (Person B) \] has been causing a lot of issues over the past 2 years and non-stop rants on facebook with no filter...  
Person A, at first claimed to be bi-polar and now claims of several other disorders (all of which Doctors can not confirmed) she now says Doctors and family don't care about her. Her family have been witnessed to be very kind caring people this has been confirmed by Person B, there is also disliking between her and sister due to her sister taking a similar stance to what I have.

She does not work due to claiming being unfit to work and literally posts 7 - 10+ facebook post a day all being (apologies for the generalization) the stereotypical edgy emo teen (She is not a teen) life is hard don't judge me crap... Then you have the posts where she will claim no body cares about her and no body does anything for her Despite posting this every other day and the mountain of people trying to make sure she's ok (on and off facebook)

Person B has been obviously affected by it for a while and clearly sick of the stuff they have to put up with but goes along with it anyway. Disappears for a whole day at times and when being in a voice call with their friend group as soon as his phone rings (most of the time with an audible sigh) immediately turns off their device and claims their internet or device is playing up (despite us all hearing them press the power button). their older sister (who is a lovely person) also takes a disliking to their relationship and she knows them in a lot more detail that what information I have.

While my opinion is obviously leaning towards 1 side its still entirely private and like i said I'm not dismissing the fact her problems could be very real but the point of this is to discuss where the line should be drawn between taking behavior as being routed in various disorders and when the person simply being hard done by and being a obsessive narcissistic individual...

TL;DR: \[INSERT RELATED ANONAMOUS STORY HERE\] Where do we realistically draw the line between accepting a person does have various mental issues they have self diagnosed and confronting them about the fact that if they are not lying for attention then it may be them expecting too much from the world or maybe another underlying problem like Narcissisms, paranoia or obsession.

I apologies if I come across as insensitive but this is something I'd never confront someone about this is all a thought exercise... But this all comes from the fact I believe there has to be a line when it comes to these issues (I don't know where that line should to be) you can't just let everyone believe they have depression or other disorders there has to be a point where you have to tell people suck it up and focus on what causes these problems for them ... being overly accepting to everyone does more damage than good, it hides underlying issues that can be tackled directly",1615381162.0,mental_disorder

How do you deal with the feeling on inadequacy?,9,11m6n3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11m6n3/help_is_there_a_mental_disorder_involved_with/,3,"I posted this in /r/askreddit but no one has commented on it yet so I figured I'd post it here. Copy/Pasted below:

Sorry if this develops into a wall of text.

**FULL READ START HERE:** I'm looking for advice or encouragement when dealing with the feelings of inadequacy. I'm not sure if it's part of a mental disorder I may or may not have, but I definitely am antisocial and get adrenaline rushes whenever I hear my phone ring (my phone doesnt ring often because I have no friends). Ignoring the recent calls I've been getting, which I will explain later, my last phone call which hasn't been a family member was over 6 months ago. I actually get an adrenaline rush whenever I do almost anything for the first time or if it's been a long time since I've done something... and I recall this always being the case since childhood. I remember when I was a child and taken to a fast food place to eat, I would always be scared of ordering by myself or talking to the cashier which continues even today if I ever go to a restaurant I've never been to before. Ever been to a french restaurant for the first time? Ordering is terrifying. I can also remember my first time buying tickets for a movie... I was young and didn't understand the process so I was terrified do approach it.

Anyways, being older and wiser, I view life as an ever growing, ever learning process which I have accepted as truth, however with that reality, comes the constant interaction with this fear/anxiety I've dealt with all my life. I've been unemployed for over a year now, trying to get my life on track by developing better habits (eating, sleeping, exercising, etc) before throwing myself back into the work force. Admittedly I've not really focused on work because I wasn't sure how I want to approach my professional life. I was thinking of going back to school, but after a while I squelched that concept and started getting bored, which was the sign to finally get back to work. So that's what I did, but being out of a job for so long, I knew I'd have to make new contacts to jumpstart my freelancing again, which would also mean working for free for some people, so that's what I did.

**MINI READ START HERE:** I accepted a short 2 week gig (dealing with making estimates and predicting future things as best as possible) that doesn't pay. In fact, I took the initiative to get the gig and was open and upfront about the fact that I have very little knowledge of how to do the gig. I figured they were looking for free labor anyways, so I was probably a pretty good choice for them since anyone who was qualified to do the job would probably charge a fee. They liked my go-getter attitude despite my lack of knowledge and proceeded to accept my free labor.

What ended up happening was I did as much research as I could possibly do to make the most accurate estimates I could and gave them my report. They responded with praise for the progress so far and notes for revisions as well as questions as to why I made such predictions. I understand that this is the process and that there will be multiple revisions and changes made, but knowing that, I still have this fear that stems from feeling inadequate for the task. I recognize that I'm working for free and they really can't complain about that or fire me, but I also feel that it's not completely out of the question for them to be mad for wasting their time if that is ever how they see it. ""Perhaps if they went with someone else, they could have done a better, more accurate job"" Is what runs through my mind. I feel that I can't fully answer their questions because some of it was a relatively wild guess, which I can't respond by saying ""I have no idea what I'm doing and just made a random guess."" I'm making predictions for a complex process that I don't feel I fully understand or will ever fully understand until I actually walk through the entire process happening. Does anyone have any advice they could give me to help me deal with these issues?

**TL;DR START HERE:** Accepted a non paying job I never felt qualified for, but was honest about not having the experience and promised to do my best. Despite things moving forward as expected, praises for the hard work so far, and a general understanding of the process, I continue to feel like I need more information to explain my decisions and actions, to do a better job because my current work is not up to par, and I'm one fuck-up away from getting yelled at and humiliated. Does anyone have advice or a cure?

I have so much anxiety over this that just thinking about it makes me feel like crying... not the sadness type of crying but the helplessness type of crying... you know the one.",1350450922.0,mental_disorder

330,4402.0,How would you explain depression to a normal person?,1,ka9quu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ka9quu/how_would_you_explain_depression_to_a_normal/,1,"In my community, depression or any mental disorders are pretty **taboo**, you don't just go around town, flitting about and telling people that you have depression or suicidal thoughts. Hell, when people hear suicide tragedies on the news, their typical reaction is '**How** can this person kill him/herself when they are so young?' '**Why would anybody** even consider suicide?' 'It **must** be the \[stress/bad social media influence/bad career path *\~any* ***textbook reasons****\~*\] that made them want to kill themselves' 'Don't commit suicide kids, you have **bad karma** in the afterlife' 'Its pretty **stupid** for her/him to commit suicide' etc etc

Essentially, I'm trying to point out that my community essentially **does not believe in mental disorders** of any sort, **nor do they response with compassion** if one is plagued by said disorders. For example, my community views those with mental disorders as **other**, as **crazy**, as **dangerous**. 

Or that they just **outright deny** that clinical depression/anxiety disorders even exists. For example, if you would confess that you are pretty depressed lately, they would think that its **a ruse to garner attention**, or that you're just **trying to be cool by being emo**. Sometimes, people will even **joke about mental disorders** in ways that shows that they **just do not believe** that people are **actually** going through shit emotions, or that their suicidal/depressive/anxious feelings are **legit** and valid. 

I think that this is because people in my community just had **never experienced** their close and trusted **friends opening up** about their suicidal/depressive feelings. Or that they had **never felt** those emotions before. Thus, they just don't believe that mental disorders **seriously** exist because they had never seen it before.

Thus, its pretty **embarrassing** and **shameful** to have any sort of mental disorders in our community. You just **couldn't expect people to emphasize** with you if you open up because they would just be in disbelief and  **hella confused** regarding why you are experiencing those disorders.

# So taking in the ways my community works, how would you explain depression to normal folks in my community?

331,4404.0,I just written this and I just wanted to share it with someone else so here it is.,2,qkiy81,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qkiy81/i_just_written_this_and_i_just_wanted_to_share_it/,0,"  

The world as of current is a massive mess, besides the Covid-19 outbreak the almost everything in the world is in disarray and one of those problems that is rising slowly but will hit very hard and mercilessly in the future is mental disorders. Mental disorders is currently spreading throughout the world like a wildfire, uncontrollably but slowly to remain undetected as much as possible. Many people may not notice as they are way too busy with work or any other things to realize that the world is slowly being burnt to a crisp by more serious problems around them. The reason why the virus was on the rise is because people are starting to stay at home as the corona virus takes its toll and starts ravaging the human race by spreading swiftly across the globe. This has nothing to do with social isolation but however is just the power of our brains when it is isolated for an extended period of time, we are just so used to living with everyone else around us and everyone around us bugging us all the time that we don’t have time to think about the actual problems that we are actually facing. We just didn’t have time to think not because we can’t or didn’t thought of it, this isolation makes us feel lonely and with nothing else to do than just think we start to think about the world we live in, start to realize that our reality is cruel and unforgiving. As more and more people get bored of games and movies, they all started thinking about it, as soon as that happens more and more people start to realize the truth behind the perfect world that they were told to be living in, the fact that no matter how successful they are they can never escape the harsh reality that is suffering and it will all end with agony, there is no happy ending to a story of a human life. The only end is death and that is not very acceptable for most of us, most of us fear it. As the people that are thinking are mostly older students that range between the ages of 14-21, I am not saying that younger or older people won’t have the same effect but it’s just more commonly seen in the people within that age range are also assisted by hormone change, the stress of what they want to be in the future and how less time they have to realize. I can say that if this goes on there will be a day that mass suicides sweeps through the globe and this will lead to the rise of the decade or century of depression as people start crawling out of the well and start realizing that what they see under the well was a fake truth hiding above the well is pure suffering. With all that said, it’s not to say that the entire human life is suffering but just the world isn’t as perfect as most of us thought it will be. We can’t completely blame the corona virus for our depression because without the corona virus, this lie that we are living may be forever and I say it’s better that we live a life of truth than a life of lies even if the truth is disappointing, unnerving, unhappy and painful. As the problem progresses we slowly will be less and less productive as we lose our will to move on and our will to work. This is just the beginning of the Age of Depression, which is an age where all people live lives in the harsh reality mental disorders soar off the graphs, forcing governments around the world to take serious action against it, which will cripple the global economy once again. 

In terms of what we can expect, it is foreseeable but only a vivid image can be seen as mental disorders are highly unpredictable, as predictable as it may seem to science of today. We can see an economic collapse as people stop needing anything besides food and other living necessities or perhaps the global demand can continue but nobody wants to work. On the standards of mental medical expertise and the availability of help to these people as of now is very limited, people may seem like they are good at psychology but believe me that they are only good at it in a scientific term, a term solely based on theories that has been proven to work in the past and is uncertain if it will work in the present. If we were want to have a chance of winning against the mental disorders, we have to start accepting new ways to treat it. This is not to say that scientific ways of treating mental disorders are always wrong but to let the world know that even things like mental disorders change so we have to change too. Besides, we can’t just throw a bottle of drugs to a patient when a therapist can’t solve their problems because this will clearly lead to another new drug problem in the future after the mental disorders problem was solved. Artistic ways of treating mental disorders are also available we just need to start accepting them, some of them may sound a little outrageous but we need to trust in ourselves that we can get the job done, we can cure the world from the disease that we are currently suffering from. Mental disorders have never been as serious as the world was mostly at war in the 19th century and not a lot of light was shined upon problems such as mental disorders. As the world slowly emerge from the conflict riddled 19th century more and more manpower is not available to seek out new types of jobs and solve new types of problems. Amongst them is mental disorders which isn’t a massive problem since its discovery in 1883 but as of now, the world is starting to show effects of the problematic mental disorders. There are lots of reasons why I bought this up, those reasons being that the people are getting depressed because they see the harsh truth and wishes to change something about it, so trying to cover up the entire thing that has already been revealed to them will only cause them to neglect what you are currently saying and walk further down the path of depression. Besides, the world can no longer have enough time and resources to get a person that is interested in psychology studies and can get an entirely perfect results in school to get approved with a doctor’s license. What they need is someone to support their ideas for once not hide what they already see there is no point in denying what they have already seen at this point so just let it be, no point saving an already lost cause. Instead, tell them that everything will be okay no need to fear the inevitable, just do what you want to do and make sure you work hard for them with your soul as the fuel for the torch that will guide you through this dark cave. People need to understand that nobody in this world can solve your mental issues no matter how hard people struggle they can never break free so do as much as you can have as much fun as you can while you still can. Science is very inflexible in itself as it is only reinforced by system after system, in short scientists can’t do art as good as how an artist can. Their personalities is art, so are their mental disorders that has been developed behalf on their personalities so we should stop treating the people that are suffering from mental disorders like some specimen but more like a piece of art. It can be called beautiful, ugly pleasant or unpleasant because everyone has different tastes. There are no such thing as ugly art, there is only people that doesn’t know which angle to view them from, people that don’t know what the art was supposed to symbolize and that isn’t wrong either because some people just generally do not like the art or the concept of it. While other people can say that it is the best masterpiece that the world has ever seen a random person can say that it is not suited to their taste. Personality is just like art, no matter how many people that enjoys a single person’s personality there will always be people that will hate them for nothing at all. People need to know the limits of science and when it is time to see that the time has come to see personality as a form of art instead of a scientific term. Science may be effective and efficient but when put up against something like artistic treatment they are completely helpless when it comes to curing without medicine. I really don’t understand why do people always neglect and reject that the fact that mental disorders and trauma can be treated without a license, without scientific terms but with an artisan way as art itself is to represent something in a beautiful way no matter if it’s simple, advanced, ugly or beautiful. Sure science can bring us there but art can bring us to where science cannot reach, someplace beautiful untouched by people that doesn’t understand it. I do think that mankind can only break the things that they do not understand but the point here is mankind has to understand and accept it. I agree that mental disorders isn’t good for us but if that mental disorder is trying to tell us a truth that has been hidden from us for a long time we should open up to it learn from it instead of pushing it aside. Isolation is the very thing that gave us a chance to think, a chance to change the lie that we have been told to us for a long time. The truth can be depressing, sad, ugly, unsettling and unpleasant but if that is the truth we have to embrace it not let it lie. This may be one of the reasons why our creator never gave us eternal life and keeps cutting our lives shorter than before because he understand that we are only living a lie that has been told to us since we are born and to only notice that death may be an unhappy ending to our lives but by that time you will soon understand that death is the most pleasant that life has ever been. For those who are still reading till here, I show a great sense of admiration to you and for those who has read this and have thought about it, I want to Thank You Genuinely. I know I am not exactly normal but special or gifted isn’t exactly the correct way to express me either. I said all that because I had the chance to notice how it feels like to be isolated for nearly 12 years and just as I was starting to crawl out of my stronghold of isolationism I was immediately slammed by another 2 years of isolation. However, I really want to thank these 14 total years of isolation that helped me to think clearer and help thinking about the possible future of humankind. I was not completely isolated from people but however in the 14 years of isolation I hid something I always wanted to talk to someone about and I didn’t because I don’t know what it was called, I didn’t have anyone to talk to so I can only bend myself to fit into society but within these two years I have since started to think about the future and about myself I found out that we don’t need to change ourselves to fit in with everyone else we can be ourselves as long as the people around us knows what we are. Slowly I saw the world that was painted in perfect colors fade in front of my very eyes. They are no longer colorful and perfect. As the colors swept away, the image of a sad, depressed and burning world unveiled itself in front of my very eyes. The world may say that this world is beautiful and successful but I wanted to ask them does beautiful mean that the world is half ablaze and people from all over the world are suffering while we do nothing to change the system at all? Everything ages, systems, humans, objects and even the world itself. It is purely up to us to change or maintain the things that are aging before they turn to rust then to dust. You may ask, what does this has to do with mental disorders. The answer is simple, as long as the people that are growing up in this world knows that they are living in a world that they will work, eat, sleep rinse and repeat the supply of depressed people will never stop until we learn how to enjoy life and how to make life look and work less depressing.",1635787511.0,mental_disorder

* Overly sensitive 
* Nervousness

\-----------------

My father

\----------------

I won't talk too much about details. Simply he married once before marrying my mother. He has a son with that woman, who more or less went through the same thing as me and tried to suicide multiple time. The woman left him one day. She asked him to go buy a washing machine. When he came back, there was only one letter. She had asked friends to help her take everything away. The first time I heard this story, I felt sad for him.

He married my mother later. It was for Christmas. It happened like this. First, he left my mother and tried to stick the pieces back with his ex-wife. When he saw that it was impossible, he came back to my mother and proposed to her. 

   
 

   
 

I was born in 1997. The first years of my life were happy, well it is what I thought at that time. My mother cried often. But I did not understand much what was going on. When I arrived in primary school, I started getting unhappy. I got bullied regularly at school. I don't know why. At home things seemed ok for me. It wasn't.

When I arrived in college, I started to get bullied for real. I had difficulties making friends. Then we moved to another city. We stayed one year in the city. That was the happiest year in my childhood. Because of the crisis of 2008, my parents were forced to go back in the city where we once were.

I had to go back in the city where I got bullied, but I was lucky as I managed to get in a private college. There I got bullied once again, but it was only mockery. 

I was slowly growing both physically and mentally. And I started to perceive things differently. When I was 7 years old, I tried to suicide myself. I don’t exactly remember why. I noticed only when I was in my 20, that I had always been a shell with nothing inside. I did not realize what was happening around myself.

When I was in Secondary School, I had a dream. One day I would be 18 (majority in my country) and I would be able to leave home. It would be a rebirth. 

I spent all of my time in Secondary School and Highschool without friends. At the time I took this well, because I knew that my time of happiness would come.

Slowly I was realizing the incoherence that were present in my home. My mother cried often. Each Christmas. Each one. My mother would cry, and it was the saddest moment of the year. It has not changed, as at the time I’m writing this we are the 12/28/2020. Also I was not allowed to leave my house. I don’t know my neighbors. That interdiction lasted until I was 18. I was also not allowed to have a cellphone. I did not go to parties, etc… 

Alright. For now it’s a classic story, and I would say it’s not even interesting to read.

When I turned 18, I instantly chose to go to a faculty, at 600km from my house. There were other faculties a lot closer. But I wanted to escape. It was the time where I would realize my dreams. Things did not go well. There is so much to say. I will try to say the least possible. The first difficult thing I had was the sensation of freedom. I had difficulties walking on the street, I had difficulty walking. I was scared the night when sleeping in this unknown location. But I think it’s common for every student. I failed my first year at the faculty. I still didn’t know what was going on at that time. I asked myself why I had failed. Of course it was my bad. When I came back home, my father did not want to pay another year of studies for me. It was my fault, I had not studied enough. And it was true. I had not studied enough. But why.

And I realize why. Because my sister was still in the same hell than me. Because my childhood was affecting me. I couldn’t socialize. I couldn’t work. I now knew that I had never met anyone with the same difficulties in their life than me. Never. Of course, I know there are people who lived worse things than this. And I didn’t meet a lot of people at that time, I often stayed at home, in my nest. But it’s not the end of this story.

So, I came back home. My father proposed me to work with him. He is an artisan. He promised me that he would help me, form me. The first year already, things were difficult for me. You have to know he treat very well his employees. Of course. All the blame always fall on me. My mother once tried to help him in his business, but she abandoned as he was impossible.

I didn’t know at that time that I was already trapped.

Of course. With my father, everything has always been a trap. My mother is trapped. He forced her to stop working. Now she has no revenue. She had no friends as no one in the family goes out. But I don’t pity much my mother. Of course I pity her. But she has chosen what is happening to her. She chose to marry that man. She chose to have children with him. Me? I did not choose to be born. I did not choose for things to go like this.

But I will say the truth. If it was only me, I would have left all of this. Even if I was poor, it would suffice to me. That’s what I tried to do when I left home, once I was 18.

Here’s the thing. I’m not alone. I have a sister, younger than me. She is a lot less strong than me. She is in the same situation than me. She is now 19 and has no job, no formations. She is scared of everything. She is very sad. And she is the reason of why I came back in that Hell. Why I am writing this. Why I am in despair. True despair. Not these bullshit things I often see.

True despair is when you see no solutions.

I tried everything. I tried to endure the work with my father. But it’s impossible. You want to know why? Because he is aged. He is in his sixties. He has the right to stop working, and he wants to stop. The problem? At the time he proposed to help me, he underestimated the task. I don’t know how he made, but he could not have formed me in 1 year. It has now been 3 years since I’m with him. So, one year did not suffice. But he was tired. He wanted to enjoy life. He did not want anymore to give me a future. So, he stopped helping me, forming me. I was still working, but if one day he stopped coming, I wouldn’t be able to get a job or to continue his business. 

Let’s resume the situation: he doesn’t to work anymore, but he doesn’t show it. 

At that time, I think things are still ok. But it’s not the end. Because I am “forcing” him to help me. It is still time for him to stop everything, but his pride doesn’t allow him. If I say I stop, everything in my family falls apart. It’s pride. Always his pride. 

So progressively. He starts to hate me. And I also start to hate him. Nowadays he considers me as his enemy. We tries multiple time to explain everything between us, but it doesn’t change.

And my sister is amongst all of this, blocked. She is depressed. I cannot help her. My father make me work every day, even weekends, holydays. I mean ok. If it’s only this. But he doesn’t pay me anymore. He yells at me for anything.

Think about the solutions I have. I can tell you that I tried everything I could think of. Of course, some things are too dangerous or illegals. I envisaged suicide multiple times. But even suicide will not help me. As the problem is concerning my sister. Should I try to leave home with my sister? Would she follow me? I think not. I don’t have any money; I don’t have a true job. We had nearly no contact between each other, I as come back from work tired and have difficulty in socializing. 

Only several minutes ago, I was thinking about my choice. And there is a sentence which left my mouth several times in my life. “There was no solution since the beginning”. I am scared of that sentence. I suffered a lot, I worked a lot thinking there was still hope. I discovered that I had a talent. At least that’s what I think, but I’m starting to depress about it. I am a good writer in fantasy. I have good imagination. I started learning English because I wanted to publish my novels in English, making money with them. 

You have to know that the only safe place I have is my room. I still live in the house of my parents. And the only thing I can do here is dream. I did this all of my life. I read several novels and think I am quite good. The problem is, I have difficulty writing. Either in my language or in english. It needs work, training. That’s what I was doing of my free time. I started to write several stories, but every time I stopped since my english and my writing skills were not sufficient.

So progressively I started to lose confidence in myself. At the beginning I even thought I was a genius.

But the true problem is. I can’t dream or think when I am angry or sad. I can’t concentrate. It was the last thing I add, and I can’t use it nowadays. I lost hope. 

So the last thing that came to my mind, only several minutes ago. I would ask the world. I would ask on a forum. Do you have solutions. Did you live through something similar.

I know that some people are giving money at stranger on internet. I spent a lot of time on internet in my life. If you can give me money, I’ll be grateful. I don’t know how to ask it, really. I don’t even have time to correct my sentences. Thank you.",1609172124.0,despair

I feel like im disrespectful towards people who are really in need of assistance since i never actually got diagnosed with depression and i havent had any major mental health problems up until relatively recently. 

I [M17] am from Serbia and im currently in grade 3 of 4 in highschool. Online classes have been going on for a year and a half with on and off mixed schooling system (involving one group of 15 going to class while other group stays at home). Needless this system has had catastrophic consequences on my grades, health aswell as my psychological state. The sheer chaos of proffesors going by their own rules of hosting classes almost whenever they want, not hosting classes, little to no assignments almost no lectures leaving us to rely on ourselves and written materials (im on natural sciences programme so figuring out analytical geometry and vectors by yourself is not easy) and expecting us to somehow pass tests with respectable grades when we come to school to take them IRL.

 This has gradually led me to completed and utter breakdown after year of quarantines, video classe and isolation. But the worst began in my 3rd grade since the pandemic started in my 2nd grade which i somehow managed to pass with good grades (mainly 4.88/5.00 /Our grade system is 1-5  with 1 being the worst and 5 the best). After the summer in 3rd grade i dealt alot with feelings of exhaustion, utter sadness and hopelessness. Alot of times i wondered about just ending it all. My grades plummeted, i had absolutely zero motivation for anything and my concentration was non existant. Somehow the semester ended and i was left to deal with my complicated familial situation after the divorce that happened two years ago which also made life pretty much bleak.

 The second semester isnt currently going any better and i only have two more months to pull my grades from a ditch and today i found out i got a 1 in English.

 On top of that my math teacher pretty much just told me openly how he ""lets me get a 4"" which i already suspected down deep inside of me. I felt so defeated when he told me that. All these years i have been trying my best and i was getting 3 most often in math. This just crushed me even knowing whenever i was retaking tests to bring my grade up, that i really was just doing a little sympathy dance to excuse a higher grade i was never really worthy off. 


All this was happening in front of some a year younger all star student who was retaking a test trying to get a 5 on some logarithms test from last year. I looked him in the eye and just told him that i know. He looked down and just quietly told me that im being too honest.

 Jesus that was hard, looking at some student just being so much better at everything than you are and your proffesor discussing what i felt like my intellectual ability in front of another student. I already have crippling insecurity regarding my IQ i dont need it to be paraded around. I like to think that i know what it feels like to be dead, the sweet embrace of void just to free me from this horrific and pathetic excuse of an existence. I hate myself so much. I just got out of nearly suicidal state a month ago and i feel like im not far off again. I tried therapy and it never really worked out since all i got was generalised bs that never really struck a chord with me.

I dont see the point in anything, in the end everything will be completely voided and oblivion will consume everything. The most horrific realisation is that all of this is completely random and without any point whatsoever. Life, death in the end its completely the same after our inevitable demise. Why should i stick around for at best mediocre experience of paying my bills and doing my taxes? Love is nothing more than  a mere chemical cascade which i will never understand; nothing more than a drug high that wears off after some time. Dating and marriage is as rational as a free market of any other commodity out there.

It would be just so easy to end it all, no pain no suffering. Sweet embracing oblivion for eternity.",1619461623.0,despair

If I'm being honest I feel bad about it, I feel guilty, like I'm bringing my burden onto others. If this post isn't allowed or doesn't really fit then please by all means get rid of it. I'm someone who has struggled on and off with depression from a very young age. My last and worst battle with it was a majority of high school. I've since graduated and I'm in college now. 

I'm not someone who deals well with being sickness, not that I think anyone does, or likes to be sick. However I've been sick for around a week now and my symptoms started out small and gradually got worse. It was a cold, of course. My immune system was probably compromised from stress and work(I'm in retail and worked 5 days straight leading up into Christmas). Sore throat, stuffiness, all of the wonderful things you deal with when getting over a cold. However 4 days ago I had a new symptom appear that I, in my almost 21 years of life, have never ever experienced before. My ears were filling and stayed plugged. I'd finally had enough so after my first night of dealing with the pressure the best I could I went to urgent care, wanted to make sure that the cold wasn't something else. The doctor I saw was very kind, explained to me that yes it was a cold, and she did see a little bit of fluid in my ears. She gave me a steroid pack and told me that within a couple days it would clear up. I started that day. Yesterday it was still just as bad, feels very full, very painful. We call the doctors back, they set us up to see a regular doctor. We go, I'm told that there's nothing they can do for me. I leave, feeling worse than before. 

This morning there has still been no improvement, no relief, no depressurizing. I'm in pain constantly, I couldn't sleep last night until I took a sleeping pill and not even that was able to keep me through the night. I can't really hear out of my ears right now because of the pressure. Everything sounds very, very distant and it scares the hell out of me. I feel so hopeless and so depressed and pathetic. We had family in town for the holidays I was so looking forward to hanging out with and I couldn't because of being so sick. They flew home this morning. I haven't been able to dredge up the energy to go wash my hair because the pressure is so intense that I can barely stand or focus. 

Over the past 36 hours I've probably had 6 or 7 hysterical episodes. Fits of screaming in pain, crying, pull my hair out, hitting myself, they last for hours. I just don't know how else to express the fact that I am in so much pain and there isn't anything I can do about it. I still live at home and my mom is a saint of a woman who has sat here and taken care of me through all of it. She deals with my outbursts and honestly she's the only thing that has kept me from trying to do something to myself. I feel guilty because she takes care of me, because when I have these outbursts I can be mean or say mean things that I don't actually mean. 

I'm scared by the amount of intense fear and sadness I feel. I want to die, and that scares me too. I just feel like if I'm in constant pain and no one can help me then what is the point? What's the point of me being here if all I can do is suffer so intensely. I feel stupid, like I'm making too big a deal out of a cold, but I don't feel like anyone understands that I am in pain constantly. There is NO reprieve. There is no temporary relief. Just a lasting, throbbing pressure in my ears. I just find myself wishing I were dead so that I didn't have to deal with this pain anymore. I just don't know where to turn, I just don't want to lose my sanity to this because in all reality it feels like I'm slowly going insane.

a) Happy and contented, or  
b) Dead

In my life I have survived a fucked up childhood, in which I endured years of physical and emotional abuse. I have survived homelessness. I have overcome a lack of education, and now count multiple Oxford / Cambridge graduates among my working peers.

I have many trophies of success. I am at the very top of my field. I earn a six figure (GBP) salary. I have just bought a house equivalent to $800,000, in cash. In spite of the pandemic sweeping the world right now, I am the most financially comfortable I have ever been. I have a fantastic wife and two beautiful kids.

If that all sounds like a recipe for happiness, then it overlooks what is going on inside me right now.

In 2016, aged 31, I was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition. This condition was asymptomatic, and remains that way for many people. In some however it can, if left untreated, be fatal.

My cardiologist pointed out that at 6ft and 17 stone (240lbs) I was considerably overweight and that if I wanted to avoid dying young then I should do something about it.

So I did. I sorted out my diet, cut down drinking, stopped smoking and started regularly going to the gym. In 18 months I had lost over 5 stone (70lbs).

I felt great. I looked great - I hadn’t even planned to go that far, but for the first time in my life I could see my abs. More importantly, for the first time in my life I felt truly comfortable in my skin, and my career began to really take off.

Again, all good right? Well, it was. Somewhere along the line, something changed. My weight became harder to maintain. I started feeling extremely sensitive to the cold. I had incredible insomnia. My energy disappeared - I felt as if I was constantly walking through treacle. I felt generally ill all the time.

To help solve the unbearable insomnia, I started drinking again. I also found that drinking on a night reduced the exhausted, treacle feeling I was experiencing. Of course, drinking is not good for the waistline - something by this point I had become a little obsessed about (think of a self made rich person who becomes incredibly tight because they’re terrified of losing everything they’ve worked so hard for - this was my attitude to eating). So I started eating less, and pretty much just the raw protein I needed for my gym work.

I realised that any diversion from my very restrictive eating plan would then cause very quick weight gain - something I was now frightened of. Two or three days of overindulgence at Christmas could easily see me gain 10 - 15lbs in weight that would then be very stubborn to shift, it just didn’t make sense. It felt cruel that six months of hard, hard work could unravel in days.

It started affecting my work. I was making up all sorts of excuses to avoid situations where I might have to eat something outside of my increasingly short list of acceptable items. I avoided social situations. The whole experience was exhausting, and I recognise now that I was exhibiting many symptoms of both alcoholism and anorexia (something which as a man, a father of two kids, I find very hard to comprehend). And believe me, alcoholism and anorexia are not good bed fellows.

I started to become very depressed. So I began drinking more, and eating less. But the strategies I had used to maintain weight before were beginning to lose their effect. The scales were creeping up, almost no matter what I did.

This included not eating at all some days. But then this massively back fired too. I was attending a pitch with work in London. I do these regularly - my job involves a lot of public speaking. I’ve always enjoyed that aspect.

I felt fine, usual nerves that go away after a couple of minutes. But then, out of nowhere, I suffered a full blown panic attack. I had never experienced this in my life before. My heart rate was though the roof, I was shaking like a leaf, sweating profusely, experiencing the most awful sense of dread. I’ve never felt so dizzy in my life, and I had the most compelling feeling of needing to get out of the room, but I knew that if I had bailed out my career would have been all but over.

I managed to get through the pitch, despite my incredible discomfort. As it happens, we won the business.

But it didn’t end there. Now, every speaking appearance I make, which is basically my job, I end up in that very same state. To a degree, lockdown has enabled me to get away with this. It’s unpleasant, but I can shake to my heart’s content on a video conference and no one really notices. I’ve measured my heart rate on my phone and at peak times, I’m approaching 200 BPM, sat still on a chair.

I’ve been getting away with it, but if I had to go and do a meeting in person tomorrow, I do not believe I could do it, as pathetic as that sounds for someone who’s been doing just that, very successfully, for the last 15 years.

I have been incredibly successful in my work over the years, against the odds really, but I cannot help but feel that at 35 years old my best work is behind me. I am a shadow of my former self. My ability to do my job and provide for my family is very much in doubt. My life's work is very much on the brink.

For the last twelve months or so I have felt crushed by a crippling depression. I cannot remember what the emotion of joy feels like. I am in agony constantly, both physically and emotionally. I’ve made two half hearted suicide attempts in the last twelve months. The third attempt, should it take place, will be anything but half hearted.

I recently discovered that my testosterone levels are catastrophically low. Around half of what a healthy 80 year old man should expect, and around a sixth of where I should be for a man of my age.

Symptoms of low testosterone in young men? Loss of energy. Weight gain. Insomnia. Depression. Anxiety.

Causes? Extreme weight loss. Malnutrition. Excessive use of alcohol.

Who knows whether there’s a connection or not, but I certainly tick a lot of boxes.

I am about to embark on a programme of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) to normalise my levels. If this is indeed what I’ve been grappling with, we’ll soon find out.

It’s my last roll of the dice. It’s either the panacea to my woes and it ends the agonising pain I am in, or it isn’t, and I end the agonising pain I am in. Six months. That’s what I’m giving it. The date is in the diary; 1st February 2021 - happy or dead.

If I am able to come through this, I have promised myself that I will join the Samaritans. I will write about my experiences in the hope that I can help others. There are events of the last couple of years that are darkly comedic.

But in the meantime, inspire me, how have you bounced back from the depths of despair and turned your life around?

Look i know the title is corny alright i get it but...thats just how i feel now and have been feeling for a while. This is the first time ill be posting here and hopefully i get some help or advice because honestly, i have nobody else to talk to about this.

So here is the situation

Im currently 18, mom passed away when i was 11 and thats when everything started falling apart. I was born in Greece, parents split up when i was 4 and had a fragmented relationship to say the best. I loved both mom and dad but as dad loved to say, ""you are a mommas boy"". She came to Australia on her own when i was 9 to seek medical treatment for her cancer (Greek healthcare is nowhere near as good as here plus she had family here she could stay with), leaving me alone with dad.

Dad was the kind of person that would be sweet to you but then show you his other side when it came doen to school work or homework. My grades started declining when mom left and so things werent great at home with dad. Anyway, mom could see my life wasnt going so well so after travelling back and forth between Greece and Australia for Christmas, we both secretely travel back to Australia where i have stayed for the past 8 years.

Now dad was obviously not a fan and for many years would try and persuade me to come back but when all else failed, he just disowned me and didnt speak to me for another 4 years. Mom on the other hand, mom was very sick and as i said by the age of 11, i stood by her bedside and said one last goodbye to her before they turned off her life support.

Now that the backstory is in order, lets gloss over sone other parts. Got bullied between years 5 and 7, moved schools multiple times, struggled with mental health which i was always told to ""just deal with"", and largely grew up for a few years with my grandparents who were...old fashioned to say the least. That relationship soon became toxic and i moved in with my aunt.

Now, my aunt never expected to have kids, never even planned to marry so i knew our relationship was going to be tough but man, over the past two years it has disintegrated. These days we barely talk, as im 18 now im expected to pay rent weekly (200 dollars/week which is insane considering i work at McDonalds). Our relationship is less so a family relationship and more of an Airbnb. I have my big HSC exams for year 12 starting in mid October and im planning to move out before then because i just cant take it anymore.

The main reason, and i wont lie here, i made this post was because i crave some sort of emotional connection. My mom, who was the only person i ever had a connection with vanished when i was at a young age, my dad disowned me, my grandparents are toxic and old fashioned, spouting stuff they know theyll regret later and my aunt has turned from the cool aunt whom she always promised to be, to yet another toxic family member whom i now have absolutely no bond with. My friends arent really the type i can talk to about emotional stuff with, my psychologist can only talk during bookings and really...i just have no one else.

Now im going to try and frame this properly because i know how scummy it can sound if i dont. All my friends around me are getting into relationships, whether they are friends from school or work. I...i just wish i had what they had and im not saying this in a selfish way. Im happy for them i trully am i just wish i could find someone just as they have not to carry my emotional baggage, but to be there to support me. Trust me i know relationships built on just each other being emotional support for one another isnt healthy but i just need someone that can be supportive. Ive been trying hard on my own for the past 7 and a half years and im slowly loosing my grip. 

Ive moved on from the horny teen mood of looking for sex and intimacy and all that and i just need someone i can talk to, someone i can confide in someone i can laugh with, cry with, hug and just socialise. As i said relationships built on carrying each others emotional baggage isnt healthy but i just need some sort of support or i feel like im going to lose it

Anyway

I really don't have many good memories as a child. I was raised by a narcissistic mother who was emotionally and physically abusive. My father never put his hands on me but never stopped the abuse.  Neither did my siblings (I am the youngest of 5). I was a small kid so to make things worse I was bullied at school. I was literally getting beaten at home and school. I think about that now and I just can't believe it. I spent all 4 years in high school extremely depressed and by the time I turned 21 I was already self medicating with alcohol. I am 40 years old now and all I have is trust issues, anxiety, depression. I want to say it isn't all bad. I am employed (I don't make much but still...at least a job is a job) and I have actually taken good care of my physical health but that's it. I dont drink all the time but I still use alcohol as a coping mechanism. I have chased everyone out of my life one way or another. I dont find joy in anything really. I am just this depressed person who hasn't done much and have been a perennial underachiever all my life. I know now that those early years of my life are responsible for the way I am now. I just dont know what to do about it. I am getting sick of it. I dont feel suicidal really but....I also dont feel like sticking around either. And I hate complaining about this stuff because I know that others have it worse. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.",1572992048.0,despair

This poem really rings true, especially the last 2 stanzas.   
  
-----------------------------------------------------------   
  
O’er the midnight moorlands crying,  
Thro’ the cypress forests sighing,  
In the night-wind madly flying,  
     Hellish forms with streaming hair;  
In the barren branches creaking,  
By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,  
Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking;  
     Damn’d daemons of despair.  
  
Once, I think I half remember,  
Ere the grey skies of November  
Quench’d my youth’s aspiring ember,  
     Liv’d there such a thing as bliss;  
Skies that now are dark were beaming,  
Gold and azure, splendid seeming  
Till I learn’d it all was dreaming—  
     Deadly drowsiness of Dis.  

But the stream of Time, swift flowing,  
Brings the torment of half-knowing—  
Dimly rushing, blindly going  
     Past the never-trodden lea;  
And the voyager, repining,  
Sees the wicked death-fires shining,  
Hears the wicked petrel’s whining  
     As he helpless drifts to sea.  
  
Evil wings in ether beating;  
Vultures at the spirit eating;  
Things unseen forever fleeting  
     Black against the leering sky.   
Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,  
Clawing fiends of future sadness,  
Mingle in a cloud of madness   
     Ever on the soul to lie.  
  
Thus the living, lone and sobbing,  
In the throes of anguish throbbing,  
With the loathsome Furies robbing  
     Night and noon of peace and rest.  
But beyond the groans and grating  
Of abhorrent Life, is waiting  
Sweet Oblivion, culminating  
     All the years of fruitless quest.

I don't really see the point of going on anymore... family has fragmented. My dad won't quit his heroin addiction. Mom left when I was five. The rest of the family... I don't know how I feel about them. I know I don't love them. Don't love anyone really. Is something wrong with me? I don't feel anything. Maybe I love my dad... in a messed up kinda way. I know he loves me too. He just loves drugs more. That fact fucks me up sometimes. My uncle and grandparents lied to the court and got me and my caretaker evicted. Caretaker isn't my dad... he lost guardianship but he comes over sometimes... less so these days. How am I going to support myself? Get a job? I have aspergers. Depression. Severe social anxiety. How am I supposed to look people in the eyes? Smile? Shake hands? Be confident? Make small talk? My caretaker says I'll end up sucking old men's dicks if I don't grow up soon... but... how? Meds don't work. Therapists don't work. How am I supposed to go to a job interview and convince the person that I'm better than all the others going to the same interview? I can't. I can barely past my classes. How am I supposed to go to collage? We're too poor anyway. Don't even have a car. Can barely pay bills. Caretaker works 12 hours a day. Does she love me? I don't love her. I should, but I don't. Am I sick? She cut me off from the rest of my family minus my dad. Was that right? They did bad things... my aunt tried to lie to the police and say I being used a sex slave to fuel my dad's heroin addiction. The rest well... I said what they did. I don't know what's right. My dad denies his addiction says he's getting better. I don't know who to trust. There is no one to trust. At least I'm okay with the fact that I can never form any long-term relationships. I have no friends. I will never have friends. I don't need them. I will never marry, or have sex. My family's bloodline will die with me. Perhaps it's for the best. I've read about addiction. There is no recovering from that. My dad will overdose and kill himself. Is god real? I wish I could believe but I cannot. I wish he would help. No that I'm worth it. I sound pathetic, don't I? I'm a self-deprecating loser and an edgy teenager. Is this what all adults went through when they were growing up? Is it just a phase? I'm not sure I want it to end though. I like being depressed. Feels safe. Is that wrong? There is no purpose without religion. There's nothing. I want to end it but I don't want to be nothing. I like consciousness. So I guess I will be worse than nothing. A parasite until I am kicked out by my caretaker. Then I'll end it. There's nowhere to go from there anyway. ",1443663986.0,despair
354,4649.0,Despair over missed opportunities,1,5audnu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5audnu/despair_over_missed_opportunities/,1,"22, dateless kissless virgin. Yes, I know there are people who have gone way longer and that all hope is not lost, but that's not what I'm talking about just yet. For the moment, let's ignore the problem of actually getting a girlfriend. I'm sure it will happen at some point in the next ten years. I'm not seriously worried about that. I'm not horribly ugly or a complete antisocial wreck.

My issue is in aversion and jealousy. I have tried for five years to get a girlfriend, failing each time. And what I've been trying to get is the experience of a college girlfriend, which, after this May, I will never be able to have. And that's a real issue for me, because every time I see anyone younger than me enjoying what I can't anymore, I get really jealous and depressed and uncomfortable. The vast majority of people get to have these memories that I can never have, and it's treated by everyone like a normal part of development. It's a seriously different experience to have a college girlfriend versus one in the working world, and it's a hole in my experience that I don't want to be sorely missing for the remainder of my life. 

Part of the issue here is that other people who are more social and better with women than I am make me feel horrible when they casually refer to their hook-ups and exes from years past, while I've been struggling this whole time. Something as simple as complaining about your ex can throw me into a bitter jealous rage. I don't try to show it but it's kind of obvious I shut down and withdraw.

I've been told that it's not a race, but all the evidence I see shows me that everyone with five years of experience are better at this than those without. I'm already well past the halfway point between when people start dating and when they get married, so I'm doubtful that I'll *ever* be able to catch up. And I don't want to be a nervous wreck for the rest of my life just because I had a few crap years. I seem to have done permanent damage to my psyche and the recovery seems hopeless.

After high school, I realized I was jealous of just about everyone and decided that I wouldn't reconnect with any of them until I'd caught up to their level. And now, in college, that's going to happen to me again, provided something doesn't happen fast.

There are deadlines in life, and I'm missing them one by one. Have people gotten along fine at my age without having a girlfriend yet? Sure. Most of them weren't looking for it, but some have gotten better. But I feel like if I give up on this, then not only will I be admitting that everything I worked five years to get was a stupid sham, but that I'm just eating sour grapes, that I'm just trying to convince myself that it's unimportant because I can't have it. And that's not convincing; I don't buy that. There has to be failure for success to be meaningful. 

The past five years have gotten me feeling worse and worse about my future. I feel like I've already made it difficult for myself to look back on my life and feel proud of it. ",1478141371.0,despair

Sorry to bother you with a long and boring rant, but I feel that my mental state has degraded so far, and i see no possibility where I have a good future. Currently, I (Male btw) am a very young, and very derranged and twisted person. I don’t want to say my age because people will likely think that I’m acting out or joking, or going through an emo phase or something similar to that. The truth is, I’m so fucked up I can’t stand living anymore. Nobody loves me. My family “likes” me, but only because they have to, and I barely have any friends, none of whom want to see me outside of school. I want so bad for my friends to save me, to hug me and tell me everythings gonna be alright. I swear to god they must have realised how fucking depressed and ruined and broken and tired I am by now. I’ve given them so many hints and so many chances to ask me if im ok. I guess nobody cares about me. Why would they? I can’t say that I’m stupid, or ugly, or unfunny or uninteresting, but I am so fucking worthless, and like I said, broken. Almost everyone despises me. It’s all my fault. I couldn’t help my best friend when he needed me, so he tried to kill himself. Like the people I blame, I was so blind. I couldn’t help him, and he says he forgives me, but I’ve never forgived myself. I often drink late at night, unable to cry until I cut myself to feel and release my pain. I’ve also used drugs to self medicate, and suffered horribly. The first time I did this (15mg), I enjoyed it, and decided that I’d rather be high than depressed. The second time (20mg), I had a horrible trip. The medication caused me so much anxiety and depression I wanted to die, but instead cut myself so many times to manage my emotions and focus on the physical pain which barely worked and left me visibly scarred. I’m not addicted or suffering withdraw, but for some reason that experience hurt me so badly. I just feel so lost and alone in life. I also feel very stressed because my parents are furious that I have 2 C’s which I don’t consider too horrible. I was at my very worst, about 1 mont ago, when I attempted to kill myself. In a spurt of anxiety, depression and fear, I swallowed 2 bottles of my allergy medication (not the drug mentioned above). After this, I regretted it and attempted to throw up by sticking my fingers down my throat. To my dissmay, this failed. However, the extreme stress this action caused me allowed to throw up not too late after I had taken the pills. This is my deepest darkest secret, that nobody except for me knows or likely ever will. Recently, I have been so sad, tired and hurt, and I feel like I want to die. How could I be this selfish. I know I’m a horrible person and I now want to give up on life so badly. Unfortunately I can’t for reasons I wouldn’t want to bore you with. I can’t imagine that my story has a happy ending. At the end of the day, Im a worthless, useless, depressed failure and dissapointment to everyone that should at least have the slightest decency to do my friends a favor and kill myself.",1529645837.0,despair

Since I was a teenager I've had ""casual"" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go ""I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier"" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think ""you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head."" I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like ""yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!""

The psychiatrist recommended ECT but the patient never got it because it wasn’t covered by insurance, and the patient did end up killing themselves a few months later.

i’m 30 and i have always been high functioning despite my depression - honor student in high school with academic awards, college in 3 years and a masters degree. 

i’ve been so miserable for all of this, culminating in moving back into my parents house for two years after grad school because i wasn’t sure i could survive. 

i began medication for depression between college and grad school. i felt great relief from the first ssri until a sudden death in my family. from then on, amongst two other major traumatic events in grad school (sexual assault and totaling my car at 80mph), i found that my medication regimen never managed to work long term. i have taken ssris, snris, lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and dexmethorpan. 

while living with my parents, i began frequent therapy and psychiatry visits. i tried more meds. i did two rounds of TMS, the second time being referred by my provider to do ECT. i also did emdr to process my assault. 

as with everything, no treatment will give me long term relief. my med manager is well versed in new treatments so i feel like i have tried basically every medication possible. 

ect also has damaged my memory even years after. i do not have the same cognitive function as before i did it and frequently forget things. 

i have also done 10 months of oral ketamine. when my treatments concluded, so did my relief. 

i have a beautiful life. i have a successful business that is all my own. i have friends and loving family.  i did not have childhood trauma. but i don’t have anyone in my life that wants to see me often or be close to me. my closest friend said it made them feel bad to hear i wanted to see them more. i am popular in my community and well liked. i have never had a long term romantic relationship. i crave closeness with someone and have failed to find it despite concerted effort to meet new people and connect. i have one friend who sees me mostly for one hang a week and no one else that i see at a frequency to feel connection. i don’t see the point of a life without closeness to others. 

between my romantic and social failures, my treatment resistant depression, and a 6 month and still ongoing battle with nerve pain that no one can diagnose, i feel extremely hopeless. i have never enjoyed being alive, and now i am battling mental and physical illness while spending almost all my time alone. and of course, our society rolls on to an inevitable doom as our climate heats up etc. 

i truly cannot connect to reasons to stay alive and don’t know how to get out of this mindset. i know it would harm my parents and that’s the main thing i can connect to. even so, i feel anger at them for creating me and am struggling to be around them. since hardly anyone else sees me often, hardly any one else’s life would change

i do not have a plan in place but i have broken my rules about making a will or writing a final letter. 

what options can be left? i haven’t done an inpatient or php before but due to my pain issue impacting work, i can’t afford to take more time off right now. i also don’t see how they would help, since i have years of therapy and meds behind me already.",1692861805.0,suicidal

I have been struggling with performance anxiety and clinical depression since my first year in dental school. I failed in the 1st year which led to me getting 6 months drop from the original class I joined and later on I had to take another drop because of my father’s health conditions during covid time. And finally I was put in a regular batch where I made friends and was coping okayish. But unfortunately i failed 2 subjects in my final year and was given another drop of 6 months. 
I failed oral pathology and periodontics. My 3rd year oral pathology HOD has been consistently downright mean to me and even passed negative comments regarding my father’s health issues and my mental health issues. She thinks I’m acting an elaborate play or faking things to gain sympathy. She didn’t sign my journal coz I took a drop from 3rd year finals during my father’s hospitalisation days and later on when I was promoted to 4th year she agreed to sign my journal certificate. Unfortunately whenever I went to her, she kept sending me back or asking me to do corrections required and I did what I was asked to do. I must have gone to her more than a dozen times back and forth. She would call me during times when I was in lecture or in OPD or whenever I went, she wasn’t in her cabin. When I had to go meet her post taking drops to sort things out in 3rd year, She passed insensitive remarks regarding my father’s health condition saying how can a person be sick for such a long time. My father was suffering from acute necrotising pancreatitis which led to 20% necrosis of his pancreas and all the complications related to it along with 12mm kidney stone which caused him immense pain and he was in ICU for a long time as he also has diabetes and high blood pressure. I brought all the relevant documents about my father’s health and asked her to make a note that I wasn’t simple missing her classes because I am not punctual but because I need to be there for my family. She rejected seeing the reports by saying “I don’t want to see all this.” I told her she can have a talk with my mother but she still did not accept that and she again said she doesn’t want to have any talk with my family. She looked at me like I was selling her some sob story and sent me away. But her comments regarding my father’s health and the way she looked at me, led me to attempt suicide because she made me feel like its better for me to disappear than ever show my face to her. I tried hanging myself and my mom found me in the room doing that. My room has a key lock and she had the keys. After that I cried a lot and it took me a long time to recover. I gave my 3rd year finals and passed 2 out of 3 exams. I failed her exams and wasn’t able to answer anything because looking at her in the exam hall triggered those memories of me trying to kill myself and everything she has done or said or how I cried pathetically during my father’s hospitalisation time. So I wasn’t able to deal with all that and failed the exam. In 4th year I sat for the KT she gave me in her subject. The day before my practical exams, I had a major panic attack where I suffered from terrible chest pains and was not able to breath properly and kept shivering. I was taken to the hospital and given IV and medication to calm down. I was in the hospital till the evening and barely had time to study for her practicals. This time I passed the theory exam but I was failed in the practical exams. She threw my answer paper on my face when the external asked me questions and asked me how was my theory paper. I was answering her and she saw the bruises I got from the IV, injections and blood tests they did the night before. And the external asked me about the same and when I told her honestly, the HOD lady lost her shit and threw the paper on my face saying how dare I go around tell others she failed me when I am not worth of passing. She thought I was trying to gain sympathy from the external. She has been mentally harassing me this way since past 1 year and so much that I have PTSD and seeing her triggers me. I also had a massive panic attack during my Periodontics practical exam and fainted. I failed that exam. 
My father went to have a talk with my dean of the college and asked him about how my exams will be taken. He met my college mentor who asked me to meet her. I met her today and she asked me to sit for the classes and then said how all my peers have becomes intern doctors and I am still in final year 1st term. 
I came home and cried a lot. I felt its not worth living because I’ve been in a lot of mental pain since my first year of dental school. I have invested my whole teenage and everything to become a dentist and yet I keep getting slapped like this by my fate and made to struggle every single day. I am beyond heartbroken and depressed, if I get failed another time then I don’t know what I will do. The oral pathology HOD is responsible for passing people in practicals and if she fails me again I don’t know what to do. 
My parents tell me they understand my pain but they don’t. My father and I have regular fights about all this. I am so exhausted that even getting up from bed or closing my eyes feel draining. I have been constantly crying and dreaming about dying. 
I don’t know how to cope or manage anything and I can’t even put an official complaint against her as I am worried she may take it personally and fail me again. But the things she made me go through deserves her to be reported in the college. Worst part is she is a doctor herself and yet she bullied me like I am some insignificant vermin not worth being taken into any consideration.
Someone please help me. I am so lost and in so much pain. 
My father said he will go and have talk with my HOD. But sadly during fights he shouts at me me and tells me about how going to my college and talking to the teachers and everyone there is him having to beg for me which hurts me a lot.",1686238796.0,suicidal

Was diagnosed with ADHD at around 8 years old and medicated quite young, Ritalin and Concerta (not at the same time) until I was about 16 when I decided to get off them (probably not a great idea), were causing major zombie issues, social issues, as well as heart palpatations. Also dealt with depression and anxiety from a young age which has remained throughout my life. Still managed to get through university without them. Not sure if these caused anxiety but have always had it as I'm sure many of you have, depression (PDD) as well which is has come and gone but always kind of stuck around.  
I have been diagnosed for both depression and anxiety.

  
Currently I am 23 and am looking to get on anti depressants as I have recently come back to quite a heavy episode of Major Depression, for the last several years I managed it a lot with smoking which in hindsight wasn't great, but ya know how it goes with ADHD and addiction, still was able to have friends and have relationships with girls etc but it wasn't till I quit smoking about a month ago due to losing a great job (redundancy) that caused all the repressed stuff to come back. Although it was good to get off smoking to confront my issues. Feels like not getting on top of it for a while has affected my learning and I can't seem to get back into things I used to enjoy / want to learn and praying for the life of me I haven't lost some of my brain already.

  
Basically, I am wondering what other people's experience is. I have been on SSRI's before (Zoloft) which was very up and down, can't quite remember what it was like then went into 'remission' and got off after a few months so I don't think I really gave them a good try. I have also heard SSRI's can be sub optimal for people with ADHD and maybe should focus on SNRI or NDRI?

  
I am heading to my doctor today and psychiatrist in a few weeks so I do not need advice, just experience of what others have found effective or ineffective. Also pretty freaky about the amount of sexual issues with SSRI's and I think I have some libido issues from my time on them as well, would hate for it to get worse if I got back on em.

  
As well as stimulants, anyone have experience with Dextramine over amphetamines? I know I absolutely can't ever go back on Ritalin but would like to hear if anyone has had better experience on Dex.  
I know ya'll ain't doctors, just looking for some experience of what other people have found effective, in terms of ADHD / depression / anxiety (the unholy trinity lol)  I know advice should come from a medical professional, which I am getting.",1697148997.0,anxiety

There’s definitely a bit of an age gap between me and the classmates that I have social anxiety from. Im about 6 years older. 
I’m really struggling in terms of, wanting to fit in and having FOMO or wondering why I’m not included. But when I am included, I really can’t relate to their conversations, humour, or even energy. Another huge factor is that I care about succeeding in the program significantly more than they do. 
I guess I feel socially lost? And I also feel really dumb for feeling social anxiety from 18-19 year olds. 

I’m also in a significantly different place in life. I’m in a long term relationship, and I have priorities etc. they’re all in their young hoe phase and they’re very strongly opinionated which isn’t wrong but also another factor why I have trouble relating. 


The hard part is, we’ve gotten into a habit (from the first few weeks of getting to know eachother) of leaving classes together and I feel awkward just ditching them to sit with other classmates. Unfortunately I think it’s this precedence that put me in this position, I’m just super friendly and we all got along at first! 

Today I made the choice and I sat at a different table in the library so that I can focus on my work, while they sat at another. I was on one hand sad that I wasn’t sitting with them but on the other hand I knew I didn’t really have interest in what they were talking about nor do they ever truly study (they kind of just gossip and bash eachother).

I think I crave having friends and making connections but the ones around me aren’t the right ones. And I’m coming to terms that, that is okay. Another layer of the anxiety is that I don’t want to just randomly start distancing myself and making it awkward. Our program is structured that we’re a cohort so I’m kind of stuck with these people for the next two years. 

They’re very good people and nothing they’re doing is wrong. I just don’t know how to get out of my head or out of the situation. I wish I didn’t get too close to people too fast. So something to learn from for sure.",1698131143.0,anxiety

Basically throughout my whole life Ive been stepped on, and left behind, during my elementary I had straight As but the problem was I got bullied, still not sure why, maybe because I am cringe or something, didnt have any friends or stuff, everyone knew me as a dumb, or rather autistic person. Everyone In my vicinity was thinking even if i hadnt met them that i am weird in some way, so stereotypes, anyways I got through that period. Next, or lets say a new period, i tried making some new friends in a new school and i fortunately did, i got 2 real bff, and like 6 friends. Like i must say that even though i have so many they all think i am a little off. To add on top of that during my life, ive always loved weird stuff, or as my parents say retarded stuff that no one else does. They complain how I am not as other kids. Complaining how I cant find anything normal. To be specific I liked electronics when i was younger. But there are two possible outcomes, I push so hard on my parents to let me do something to the point of their exhaustion, but it takes quite a bit of time, or i get rejected in the most awkard way possible. For example as i already said being called weird, not normal, mentally ill, etc. All of that as well as how I should go to gym, do some worthy stuff, etc. Well u might say this is some normal talk, right? no! I ACCEPT THEIR RUDE TALKING, and i listen i go to the gym all my friends told me to go, my parents a few months ago, and I go. I really like going to the gym,  although i am skinny (almost anorexic), i gain nothing, i start taking proteins, anyway, i got in argument with parents, proteins are bad they say, I try to explain that they are all natural... But they persist, i give up and dont go to the gym anymore. Partially cause of them, cause of my weight, and school stuff. My grades have went down a little. And i wanna fix them. Now few months pass again, I tried hobby number (3000, lol) 2, pyrotechnics, although dangerous, i learned a lot over the course of a few months and met some great people on the internet. They didn't allow me, i can kinda understand them, but they should know that i am still 19 and i believe i am responsible enough for most stuff. But the problem lies there, they reject me nicely first, but i kinda persist cause like why wouldnt i do something i like, and i get called everything after that. I also usually forget stuff pretty fast, my brain's coping mechanism. Third hobby again, i wanna do electronics  (220v) and low voltage stuff too. But again same things happen as always, get yelled, and lose hope. But by far one of the most things that hurt me is I wanna become a developer, but since my bro does very bad in school, they break the computer  or ban it from time to time. Also i get yelled at for using the computer too much, even though i only do 2 hours of programming. Not to forget i always get yelled at for something what he does even if i did nothing wrong.

I was then admitted to the actual hospital for three days, being constantly watched at all times to make sure I didn’t do anything to myself.  I had to speak with a psychologist and they officially diagnosed me with major/ clinical depression and anxiety.  It was interesting.  I was prescribed antidepressants but they haven’t kicked in yet.   I’ve lost appetite in everything and nothing it truly intriguing to interesting anymore.  Every day at school i’m just exhausted.  My friends have been getting mad at me recently for small things and then I have to write very, very long paragraphs just to apologize to them.  My friends are draining me- and my family.  I have to take care of a handful of my friends problems and make sure they don’t commit suicide or hurt themself.  It’s tiring.

From that, I’ve developed being very negative with myself to be perfect and admired.

Should I tell her about my anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts?",1,yuqj4m,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/yuqj4m/my_mother_has_anxiety_should_i_tell_her_about_my/,1,"Context. We're an Indian family. My parents have ruined my dreams and forced their dreams on me. We used to fight a lot when I was young, when I felt like I can still make a change in my life. 

Now I've given up. I'm in the US struggling with my masters, trying to fulfill my parent's dream. My parents are very happy with me right now but I'm miserable and scared inside. I've removed my friends, family and family friends from my life because I don't trust anyone to be able to help me. Yes I do therapy and have a psychiatrist, but I've lost faith. I can't even get too deep into the treatment because I feeling guilty about the cost. 

My mother has anxiety. She never told me but I know it. She vaguely told me about 'visiting a doctor because I make her stressed' and I saw her medication for anxiety. Why does she not tell me about it? Because we're Indian. On top of that, she actually had ovarian cysts, due to which she had surgery to remove them. That has taken a toll on her health and she must think that her anxiety is justified because of her physical well being. 

My parents used to mock my tears when I was a kid. Fyi, I used to cry after coming back from school every single day. I used to sit in my room and cry randomly because i understood that I have no interest in what my parents are forcing me to achieve and that is going to ruin my life someday. For 10 years, it was a routine to sit in my room and cry intermittently for 4-5 hours while simultaneously doing my work. I don't know, but that doesn't feel normal to me. But I never got help, I couldn't. Mental health isn't a thing in India, especially my family. My mother even told me, ""why do you cry like this? If you continue, do you know you might become depressed and end up in a psycho hospital""? She found out 3 times accidentally my self harm marks, and scolded me. Told me I was ungrateful and that she couldn't tell my father this cause this would hurt him so much. 

By the way, my parents and I have a very loving relationship now. Distance has played a major role. Or I don't know, their attitude towards be has changed. They are not as harsh with me. They encourage me to sometimes draw, go out, sing, buy things for myself, anything that makes me happy: a start contrast from my childhood. I think to some extent they have noticed the effect the childhood has had on me and they are trying to go easy on me now. 

I love my parents. I recognize that even though they've forced their dreams on me, they've only done it because they thought that would be the best for me. They only wanted me to have money and security and therefore forced me in the direction they thought would help me. And they have worked incredibly hard for me. This is where my guilt kicks in. They have worked so hard for me, why am I so depressed? Why can't I just give them what I want happily? Why can't my brain just stop being miserable? 

But nothing can stop me now from functioning less and less like a person while pretending to be alright over my 3 minutes call with my parents everyday. I've been dreaming about dying peacefully. I've been thinking ways of offing myself but my biggest regret will be if I leave my parents behind with this. After all their hard work, I don't want to do this to them. I want to die, but I don't want to do it while my parents are alive. It's going to ruin them. 

I'm scared to tell my parents I'm depressed. 
1. What if they think I'm ungrateful. 
2. What if they think it's their fault? I don't want that. I'm not trying to punish them. I'm just trying to come clean. This is affecting my ability to look for jobs because the moment I open my resume the idea of being judged again becomes so scary that I push it off.
3. What if this affects my parents health? What if my mother gets sick from worry? She's been a physically weak person lately, and I'm scared that if I tell her anything..",1668405721.0,anxiety

I’m a 20 year old male with anxiety, self destructive tendencies, self harm issues, and had 2 suicide attempts. I also suffer from anxiety attacks and backslide when trying to make my life better. My childhood trauma had a negative impact on my mental state as an adult and I’d like to share my stories because no one irl would want to listen. 

•STORY 1: 

When I was a kid, my parents would beat me. I was in the wrong I’ll admit, but the punishments were too much. My punishments ranged from mild slaps in the face, belt whippings, and even punches/kicks. My body would be covered in red marks and bruises if I get in trouble in school or get a bad grade. My parents would scream at me to “shut the fuck up” if I cried at all and I’d get hit more. They told me to wear long sleeves and pants to school to cover it up. 

One time in 3rd grade I was crying alone in the classroom while everyone else was in recess. The teacher asked why I was crying and I told her my legs and thighs hurt and showed her the belt laceration marks I got the night before. The teacher hugged me tight and I cried so violently I vomited on her but she didn’t mind. 

The teacher called Child Protective Services on my parents the same day and the Agent said they’re coming in a week to investigate. In that week, my parents fear mongered me into thinking foster families and orphanages are worse and my young, stupid mind believed them. They never hit me in that week and my wounds healed, so the Agent had no evidence to take me away. My parents mellowed out as they got older, but my mom would continually tell me shit like “you’re a failed abortion, you should thank me you’re alive right now”. 

Later on they told me they’d never hit my sister because she’s a girl and girls should be treated with care. Those words made me so fucking angry. Just because I’m a boy, you can treat me like garbage? Just because I’m a boy, you can hit me? Just because I’m a boy, I don’t deserve love? 

•STORY 2:

When I was 9 years old, I made a male friend and we had fun playing during recess. One time, he confessed he liked me. I didn’t know what to say and he forcefully kissed me and touched my genitals through my pants. I couldn’t fight back because I was a very small kid. It happened for a week, but that was already enough to kill my self confidence. I understand he must be going through some stuff at home to even think about doing this, but I still hate him. 

I was hesitant to tell my parents or teachers because I was scared no one would take me seriously and just make fun of me and call me gay. I never told anyone I know in person this story because they’ll lose respect for me and think I’m a joke.

STORY 3:

My first relationship was terrible. It started off well, until I opened up about my feelings. She told me she dislikes unconfident men. I was called insecure, a mental wreck, and that she lost all interest in me. I ended a 1 year relationship in 1 hour. All because I decided to stop this facade of a confident man and tell her more about myself. I closed my heart and never dated again from there. She taunted me after our breakup saying she fucked other guys and told me the details. I immediately shut her down and never talked to her again.

AFTERTHOUGHTS:

I am depressed. I’ve experienced things no child should ever have to and it put a negative impact on my mental state as an adult. I’m not as mature as other adults my age and I think like a kid compared to them. I struggle to make friends because I’m awkward and can’t relate to people my age. I show all these problems, but no solutions. The solution that puts me at ease is suicide, but I still have this sliver of motivation to make my life better.

I started working out, going fishing, bought myself a dog, but my past follows me like a dark shadow and I feel like time is counting down to the point I can’t take it anymore and I go through with ending it all.",1692695164.0,trauma

Things were getting better until recently, when I started having flashbacks again. Most of the time, they were about events that happened in my childhood, when I was young and defenseless and couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. But recently, they've been about other things - more recent things involving my relationship. I've been in quite a few bad relationships, but my boyfriend who I've been with on and off for four years, has been the best and the worst thing to ever happen to me. We love each other so much. He gets me and I get him. We're both mentally ill, we both had horrible childhoods. But we've never judged each other for our pasts, we help each other grow. We both go to therapy now and are on meds. But we've also hurt each other in a lot of ways, and the trauma has been weighing on me recently. For him, it was cheating. For me, it was spitefulness. I was angry at him for a long time for the things he did - he may not have physically gone out and hooked up with other people, but he was on dating apps, sending nudes to other girls, etc. I hated him for a long time, and I said horrible things to him, wanting to hurt him for how he hurt me. But things changed a few months ago. I tried to kill myself when I found out he cheated again and was addicted to drugs. It wasn't entirely his fault, I was spiraling at that time and everyone knew it was bound to happen. It was just the straw that broke the camel's back. He stayed in the hospital with me the whole time, so afraid to let me go. He told me he couldn't live without me, and we've never been better since that happened. He got sober and we started going to therapy, and I haven't felt suicidal in a long time since then. But some days are harder than others. Sometimes when we get into fights, I notice it happening. My hands start to shake, my vision starts to blur and I can't focus on anything, I'm instantly transported back to that hospital bed, purging the pills and feeling so worthless and so unloveable. He's been great through this whole thing. He's recommitted himself to me, and he's changed so much. I've honestly never been more proud of him. Trust takes time to build back up, but I'm trying. It's just hard building it up again when I feel the fear creeping up on me when I least expect it. I just want the flashbacks to stop.

I was shouted at a lot as a means of discipline and behavioural correction. I strongly believe it is a bad way of correcting behaviour, and shows a persons inability to control their own emotions and handle situations effectively.

I wasn’t a particularly badly behaved child, and in fact was praised by my teachers at school for being well behaved and sensible. However, I felt like I was bad, because of how any behaviour deemed unacceptable in the home was handled. I often inferred from what family members said, that I was a terrible child because I heard things like “what would I have done if I had two children?” (I have an older half-sibling but we were raised apart, and in fact had no contact with them for 5 years between age 10 and 15 so in my close family I was an only child and the youngest in the family by 9 years)

I felt very much like an outsider in my family and because I was the only child, I was the only one who was shouted at. I felt like a burden to everyone and that I was unwanted and unloved by my family. I would cry and be accused of “crocodile tears” after being shouted at, as if my despair was a means of garnering sympathy.

I always felt as if I walking on eggshells, worried about the reactions of others, and I was scared of doing anything wrong.

Earlier on in my childhood I think around 4-5 I was threatened with getting hit (via smacks with a hand), when misbehaving, sometimes I was hit, but this only really lasted as long as it hurt me. For instance, when I got to an age where it didn’t hurt anymore it stopped. I was often shouted things like “I don’t care if you cry blood!” around this time, on one occasion, whilst being locked in a bedroom because I refused to finish my dinner. (I was let out a few minutes later after crying buckets and promising to finish the food).

I had affection denied sometimes if I misbehaved, either by being ghosted/silent treatment or being refused hugs. My family isn’t really an “I love you” saying or a very tactile family (I didn’t hear “I love you” until after I’d had my depressive/psychotic episode and came out of a mental hospital at 22.)  I used hugs as my way of expressing and receiving affection. It gave me validation and refusal of hugs felt like a rejection.

I had anxiety everytime I had a parent’s evening in primary school, because I feared being shouted at and belittled afterwards. I would often say “please don’t shout if it’s bad” before parents evening. 

Being shouted at made me deeply upset and hurt, it felt disrespectful, I often was shouted at in front of other family members, and extended family. It was humiliating and I never received an apology for the inability of caregivers or family to control their emotions. 

For instance, I was once severely reproached by three people, at once because I “lost” a raincoat on a school trip. This was when I was 11, and I went upstairs to offer some guests a drink. 

I was so badly shouted at and completely irrelevant shortcomings were being brought up and fired at me. 
I was even made to write out a list of punishments, and a list of privileges that were to be taken away from me, because of my apparent actions.
I was so stressed and in such low spirits afterwards that I started self harming. Ironically, the jacket that I had “lost” showed up again in the same suitcase pocket that it had been packed into prior. 

I.e. the adults didn’t check the suitcase properly, and went off on me because they thought I’d lost it. Not a single apology was made to me for that monumental lapse in judgment.

I had headaches frequently in the weeks and months following and for the most part was miserable. I was also bullied at school, around this time, which made me feel suicidal by age 11.

As I went through adolescence, I was very quiet and shy. In some ways I was a shell of a person, I had very low self esteem, low sense of self worth and developed “people pleasing” behaviours. I wasn’t shouted at as much, because I wasn’t the “annoying, nuisance child” anymore. If I was shouted at I tuned it out as a means of protection. 

Feeling like an empty shell allowed people to take advantage and bully me during my teens, I was subjected to intense bullying and racism at the hands of my peers, most of whom were friends who turned against me. I was isolated and alone, and I lost the ability to trust other people. The only way I survived was by detaching from my emotions, so my treatment wouldn’t bother me. I appeared withdrawn and refused to show emotion, because of my trust issues. However, I always pretended that I was “ok” and did what I had to do to get by (including physically defending myself where necessary).

I was deeply sad inside, but I’d become so good at lying about my true feelings that, I fooled myself into thinking I was ok. I secretly loathed myself because of my lack of confidence, my self-proclaimed lack of personality and because I had started to internalise the horrible things that bullies had said to me over the years. I believed there was something fundamentally wrong with me, and I blamed myself for it. I never spoke out because about my experience to anyone because I feared backlash. 

I remember once, when I was 19, someone said to me that I was dead inside. In some ways he was correct. At that point in time, my inner self had been assassinated; both by myself through negative mental dialogue, and through the harsh words and actions of others over a sustained period of time, I didn’t really know who I was if I am being honest.",1682377849.0,trauma

The relatives family members mocked me for my studying habits and demotivated me for studying(academics workload) long hours. They pushed me into believing that I was abnormal and mocked me by saying that- 'highly educated people in their village end up becoming a garbage collector'. They used to say that I ran away from my house( which was infact true) as my step- mom didn't provide me enough food( partly true) and came to their place to eat. They used to make me feel so degraded,and I gradually lost respect for myself, my self worth and my self confidence. Even at the school I went to, the teachers had low standards and didn't recognise my value, which caused me to progressively start doubting myself. 
On that fateful day, I was studying with books spread out all around me when I suddenly realised that I was struggling to grasp the sentences in the books I was reading. Also no matter how hard I tried to get away, I started to get a sharp, tingling sensation like a needle all over my head. I went down to the room where everyone was watching TV in comfort and attempted to understand what was written in that small book, but I wasn't able to absorb the lines' meanings as well as I used to.
The following day when I arrived at the classroom, they were displaying a presentation about pursuing a career in finance, but I was indifferent and started to despise everyone since I was so uncomfortable from a strong tingling feeling that seemed like a needle running across the top of my skull. Due to frequent insults like ""he is a senseless person,"" which came from individuals both at the relatives' home and from instructors and students at school, my personality was completely destroyed.
The tingling, needle-like sensation went throughout my entire body, turning me from the once-intelligent, bright youngster into a hollow, dim-witted adult. Even though it has significantly lessened by this point, I am still dealing with that annoying tingling sensation. This is my entire, horrible story, which I deeply regret. Thanks for reading. Any other suggestions for reducing this grating tingling sensation would be greatly appreciated.",1686299212.0,trauma

Even when he attacked me and caused my right eye's vision to be blurry (to this day), she proceeded to tell me i'm not the victim and that he's a good christian man.

the only person i told was my grandma, who i was very close to at the time. she believed me and comforted me, until i came out to her, causing her to insult me and support my abuser as a way to hurt me.

Not too long after, my dad came back into my life after being in jail for a while, and we have a somewhat close relationship now. inside his car, i decided to confide in him and tell him everything. he was livid about the whole situation and told me if anything ever goes down, to call him.

he slightly brought it up to my mom, and she went into a whole rant, calling me a ""liar"", saying i have ""arrested development"", and painting me as this horrible person, all in all.

despite this, i still defended myself but gave up after being constantly harassed and talked about in a vile way by my mom and stepdad. (my dad still stood by me, btw)

People would trigger me for so many years, trying to pick at the darkness in me for whatever reason & i took the bait. Some say i intimidate them just with eye contact.

Coming from one of the most gruesome experiences that took a huge chunk out my life, my only peace now is being a LEADER.

If you are suffering, find how you can serve, because i hated everyone & everything. I remember i didnt eat or drink for a week as i wanted to die, beyond suicidal pain, thats me.",1680643492.0,trauma

I (40F) have clinical depression and anxiety stemming from some sexual abuse/assults I experienced as a child and teen. My kids (10F, 12M) know I have anxiety and depression. I obviously haven't told them the reasons behind my mental health struggles. But I have always made it a point to talk to them about my stuggles in an open and age appropriate manner. 

My daughter is very mature for her age (mentally and physically). Lately, she's been picking up on my fears and anxieties and mimicking them. She's beginning to allow fear to hinder and hold her back. I have already begun looking for a therapist for her to see. I intend to tell her the reason I worry the way I do is because some bad things happened to me when I was younger. How much I go into explaining those bad things will be determined by a plan I put together with her therapist. At this point, I'm just waiting until she has someone to help her process the information I give her. 

I'm worried that telling her about my experiences and struggles will cause her to be even more scared. I also have a history of self-harm. My kids have no idea about this, but once I tell them, they will most certainly connect the dots and realize that's what my scars are from. I dread this part especially because I don't want them to be mad at me or scared for me.

Any stories, advice, or information from people who've been here (either in my shoes or my daughter's) would be greatly appreciated. I feel like an idiot asking the internet about something so personal. But a therapist can't always speak from experience, so their help sometimes only goes so far.",1677643855.0,trauma

It was a problem when I was younger, I grew up in a hostile place where nothing was permanent. I can't stop thinking about it, it's engulfing my thoughts.

I don't want to die alone, I feel one day my time will come and no one will mourn me. I will be forgotton, abandoned, left to rot, or something like that.

Sexual trauma as a man is hard to deal with.

In sports, got sexual harassed and ended up quitting.

My last relationship witha women was awful. She claimed to be woke but, ended up cheating on me because my sick was small.

Tbf, objectively its not small based on the size charts and all that bullshit its average or above average but I still feel small. I tried having sex with someone and it was awful I felt so uncomfortable. 

On top of that I had to do everything the other person just kind of laid their til it was over. 

I felt super gross and inadequate. I'm not necessarily small but I guess I'm like 2 inches above the average but that's only bone pressed I probably only have a few inches of usable length. The reason this has been such a big focus for me is the guy she cheated with was bigger. My truth is im roughly 6.5 inches nbp(7inch if you care about bp) usable length and 5.5 girth. Maybe I have only sqted size queens but I was so inadequate. Its insecurity and its not tied to my depression but it affects my interpersonal relationships

I never knew what cuckholding was and not shaming anyone but she practically tried to make me a cuck. When I got upset about the whole thing she threatened to send him(guy she was cheating with and his friends who were fucking her) to beat me up. It was all really weird while telling me she loved me. 

She violated my boundaries during sex and everything. The worst thing about it was I would literally have sex with her for hours. I would not get off and have to just jack off in the corner. the bjs wre toothy and shitty. (After we broke up and gave more guys stuff she was better I felt gross knowing how many people she's slept with)

Worst part is my dumbass after everything tried to work it out. She then told me I wasn't a man(I have smaller balls due to trauma to my testicles at a young age). Tried to fuck me in the ass cause I didn't have a man's dick.

Its embarrassing and shitty but I literally have no one to talk about this with like no one not friends not family saying anon shit that no one will read is the only thing that gives me comfort while I procrastinate on studying.

I hate myself. I wish I hadn't lived to this point. 

I literally almost broke down the last time I had sex thinking about how gross i felt. So fucking worthless. I don't want to be a cuck but I realize I can't be with anyone and it sucks so much. The sweet nothings that people  tell you like its the motion of the ocean and shit don't matter if the girls need a big wave.

I don't hate women either its not their fault its my fault for being a pathetic worthless small dicked loser. Im a spineless worthless coward. I may never be a man.

Fucked up my leg jumping onto a box today infront of a bunch of people at the gym. It was sok embarrassing. Its hard because I'm so ugly most girls don't like me. Also, my ex is right I'm a dad bodded, smalldicked, worthless, skinny legged, stupid, ugly, pathetic dumb fuck. I don't have self esteem because I don't deserve any.

I am trying to find some self worth. But until I make 500k a year for a few years im never going to be anything. I hate that I spent time with her. 


I have a therapist but he's terrible for trauma. All my trauma in life sucjs. R happened in my early years. Molested by bullies in middle school. Groped in highschool. Now I'm violated by my partner in college and its because I'm not a man even though she told me im a crazy person and she hopes all her sleeping around doesn't make me kill myself. She was hoping I died. Its gross. Same with my therapist.


The new girl is an fwb but its roughly the same. Shes nice but is always being so awkward. Idk man.

Being a guy is tough too. Women think its all fun and games. No it sucks over here. Guys are way more lonely. No one cares about us and the world is cold as fuck. 

I'm such a failure. Been working out 8 years and have gotten so weak and fat. I have a semester left of college and my grades may make it so I never go anywhere else idk. I'm tried. I just neede a place to vent I know the internet is bad but I just want to right it and send it to the abyss. Hell I'm probably going to blocked or some shit I hate that but it happens. This is loneliness and the internet age we have to post it. It only feels real when others see it we no longer feel real to ourselves.",1636256660.0,trauma

402,5276.0,My story (religious trauma),28,fov3g5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fov3g5/my_story_religious_trauma/,11,"Story 


My story (first post ever)

Hello, to someone who might read this. 

It feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. 
I'm not professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don't tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it's not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the ""phase"" I have. 

But I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I'm going to. 
As long as that is impossible I'm trying to figure out what is going on with me on my own. 

I did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.

 I thought my issues weren't that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can't call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. 

Generally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it's gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. 

And now there are two parts of me fighting. 
The one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I'm exaggerating, that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. 

Im torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. 
I feel like no one could ever get me. 
Because my ""trauma"" doesn't feel validated. 
Even though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. 

It still feels like I don't deserve to be heard. 
Because on the surface everything was perfectly fine. 

And even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can't. I can't look at the positive aspects and live normally. 

It affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can't concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I'm constantly on guard and don't feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I'm hiding fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I'm at my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I'm not worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I'm not obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don't want them to think that what she does is real love. 

But the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a ""myself"" even exist? Can I ever be ""it""? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. 

I feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. 

Everything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. 
That's why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can't get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). 

I feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. 

Im doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can't do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. 

That was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. 

So, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?

 (I'll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I'm missing blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) 

It all started even before I was born. 
My parents found each other through friends and got together. 

My mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don't exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle's parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.
They got together and married. 

Then their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. 

Then I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. 
I never knew anything different. 

And as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the ""big"" service. 

And then the indoctrination started. 

I don't remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? 

I just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren't much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. 
Now it's easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. 
But at what price? 

It's scary to me that my memories are so blurry. 
I don't even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).

I just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god's eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. 
I wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. 
And I achieved that, I think. 

But now I hate my past self for caring so much.
 
So what where we taught there? 
God created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil's work) and even though they didn't say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the ""real"" truth and that every other church doesn't have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. 

We were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god's (the church's) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.

 So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don't have control about anything anyways. 

But we're still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a ""free will"" granted from god. 

While writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. 
And it was a core beliefe of mine. 

When an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can't anymore. 
And then everything shatters. 

Losing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. 

So in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you're not saved (because for someone who is ""really"" saved it's physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it's because god did it. 

You're never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You're even unable to think in the ""right, good way"". So you're basically nothing and unimportant. 

But when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you're worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. 

Another bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you're nothing but with god you're worthy. 
It makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. 

Who are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. 

That's why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying ""sh*t"" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. 

Because of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the ""world"" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). 

We weren't allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren't allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. 

So if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you ""fall in love"" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren't sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. 

We were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner's personality. 
They told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.

Another contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think ""wow I really value my partner as a person"". 
No, they're s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). 

No one is appreciating anything. 
And if they are, they're VERY lucky. 

Because there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. 

Girls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. 
And if you're all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn't want you, wouldn't he? 

We were told we were pure glasses of water. 
And if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. 

But the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That's why there should be only one guy from the start. 

So that you don't end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. 
Now I know it's bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. 

We were told to cover up so guys don't sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren't tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. 

And if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you'd get in trouble for it.

I was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I'm glad mine wasn't as controlling as others and didn't force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. 

I was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that's the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn't really enjoy). 

So there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. 

With 12 you move from being with children to the ""big"" service and you're finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. 

But then you're also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. 

When I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to ""work"".)

Because in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I'd be called that it would curse me. 

I did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be ""myself"", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn't do that, because no one can ). 

I thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was ""myself"" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. 

And I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn't notice at the time. 

People abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you're not inviting people. 

I'm so glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. 
Which I was for being in that ""church"". 
And they told me early on: it's a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. 
But we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. 

School was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. 
And even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn't feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren't allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. 

And that's why my definition of ""home"" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. 

So what was living in my ""home"" like? 

I'm the first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I'm told is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.

When I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. 

So I just learned to not show my emotions at all at ""home"". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. 

My father was in control of everything and to this day he's still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. 
And he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. 

He is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. 

My parents (more my father) still don't want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can't ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. 

As I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn't have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that's what god made us for. 

Popping out babies, cleaning und cooking. 

But I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. 

And then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? 

In church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. 

Because your husband is by god's law above you and there to ""lead"" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can't decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don't have control anyways. 

That's why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what's going on.

I idolized my father until the realization that we don't have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. 

I had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn't find anything. 

He wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. 
In front of him I am what he wants me to be. 

I don't know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I'm honestly sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. 

I could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. 

Whenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. 

And that's why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I'm highly dependent. 

Another thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife's home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). 

When I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. 

And in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.

I know that I was sad but I somehow can't really recall my immediate emotions from that day. 

And I thought I'm glad that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn't able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn't cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn't think about it for years. 

But when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. 

It was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn't I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn't process properly. 

Then three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. 

When I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). 

Back to the cult. 
So am I still there? No. 

My parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September 2018 we drove away and never came back. 

And many others left too. 
We still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don't want to confront my parents.
 
I really don't want to be there because every time we're there I'm not really there. I'm just a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I'm always completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. 

I don't know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can't control it. 

And sometimes I'm just sad for no reason, I still can't sleep and still get a massive headache and can't stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn't and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can't stop. 

And it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn't understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am really grateful for. 

And something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. 

Now I can control if I'm going to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.

When my father is mad at me because I didn't do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it's disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn't stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It's the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. 

There are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am and then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I'm the best daughter someone could have and that he's so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. 

But on the inside I think: ""if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don't of, you wouldn't talk to me anymore"". 

He is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. 

And also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: ""I'm sorry but it's too late."" 

I don't have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. 

The first 16 years of my life partly wasted. 
I feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. 
And I know it's technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. 

And it makes me so mad that I was born because of the ""church"". Because they convinced my father to have children. 
I was cursed before I even existed. 

And still. 

I can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. 

All of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. 

There is no moment in my life where I wasn't afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.

And it was so frightening, because when it's out that you messed up you can't attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that's when people know. They see that you're not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course ""premarital s*x!!!"" 

When a couple did it (and someone found out) it's made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. 

And I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.

 I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.

 My parents and everyone in church who was ""responsible"" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a ""bad influence"" away from me. 

But I still watched what I wasn't allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. 

Basic knowledge like: it's okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.
 
And now? I just want to move out and study something so I'm always safe. I can't wait for the day where I'm finally going to be financially independent and don't have to rely on my father.

Wow it feels good put all of that in words. 

When you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. 

I just wish I could get help.



update: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn't wait any longer (I was stubborn).

My Dad was in the army and deployed most of my younger years (4 -9) and my mom had a full time job so i spent most the time with my grandparents of my dad's side. I didn't mind loved it actually, my grandad was retired but had a job to do like pretty much everything at our local church and he'd bring me along so I'd have this big church to explore and help my grandad where I could.

Well fast forward to a couple months after my 10th birthday, he got hospitalised for something that I was not told and honestly don't have the strength to ask now. Anyways we talked lots over the phone after it happened and he told me he'd be back in a week or so which was as far as I know what everyone thought as well. Well tragedy struck and took my grandpa away from me and why because he was puking Blood and his hospital bed alarm was broken he died in agonising pain from the aftermath of it. The first weeks were rough for everyone but I was just a stupid kid and I guess just buried it very deep.

 But these last couple years I've been going through some phases where I would just sit there depressed because of stuff that just gets to you in teenage/early adult years: having no girlfriend when everybody else already had multiple or at least one, not many friends that I could trust with shit that mattered and even worse I lost that what was most precious in my younger years my faith in religion something that probably helped in those early years after my grandad passed knowing he was in a better place.

Now I just dont believe in it at all I just remember feeling alone because my granddad was taken from me the one person I honestly admired and looked up to the most, every time I enter a church or go to my grandmas place I just have to pull my self together. I remember the first thoughts of doubting it why did he get taken and not someone else, I didn't care who it would have been but why him. 

I think that's one big reason that I just have some days where I contemplated killing myself even when it was only a slight inconvenience or upsetting thing that happened, it always builds till I get to thinking of me losing my grandad. I don't think I will ever truly get over it but getting this off my shoulder for the first time ever, even if nobody bothers to read this just feels a bit liberating.

If you read all this, i thank and appreciate you and  life is precious and you never know when someone gets taken so appreciate your loved ones and maybe give them a hug .",1663628759.0,trauma

405,5299.0,"PDD Diagnosis, SA and Childhood Trauma",4,q2lttf,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/q2lttf/pdd_diagnosis_sa_and_childhood_trauma/,0,"I remember early in my life looking at my mother, her life and saying ""not this.""

\*\*\*SA WARNING\*\*\*

I'm 23 years old and was recently diagnosed with depression. I felt like I was struck by lightening and I'm still trying to process everything I have just realized for the first time. 

A small background - I was sure I had PTSD. During my early to late teenage years I was sexually abused by my step-brother, raped by two work colleagues (I worked in healthcare- more reason I don't trust healthcare workers). I attempted suicide at 17 years old. My mothers response : ""I hate my life too, I might go kill myself."" 

I am always trying and finding ways to forget, I hate remembering, I hate flashbacks - I just tell myself to shut up, stick my earphones in attempting to drown out my head. I have never slept well, I'm used to getting little to no sleep. 

Here lies the problem and why I feel how I am was normal: My narcissistic mother.  Of course the history of SA has had an awful impact on my life, soul crushing, something I have tried to address in the past but felt nothing worked. I tried to keep going, I didn't want to kill myself anymore (had thoughts but no plans) because of the guilt and fear my mother put on me. I just don't want to exist. But I didn't realize my mum was the root of my constant low mood and no self esteem. 

I got to this point in my life: 

\- I left my job that I wanted to do, I wanted to be a nurse but and just couldn't take it anymore. 

\- Went back to college, did well - got into university and gave it my all, I've never worked so hard in an academic setting, did the best I've ever done. 

\- Moved into a place with my beloved partner of 4 years. 

And then it all hit at once ""Why do I still feel like this?"" I've worked hard, I felt like I had done everything I could to lessen the pain. It didn't matter, I don't know who am and feel immense shame and guilt. I thought working hard and progress would give myself confidence, but it didn't. I have never fully looked at myself or tried to understand myself. It was too painful. I wanted to persevere my way to happiness, no matter how miserable I felt during the process. In my mind - I don't matter, others do. If I can make other people happy or help, that's enough for me to be aloud to exist here.   

I walked on eggshells my whole childhood. My mum emotionally and physically abused me. I remember feeling like I didn't know what I had done wrong and confused after my mum would scream, cry and throw a desk at me from across the room then leave me alone and not talk to me for days. She would constantly spin everything to be about her and still does but it helps I'm no longer a child and ""that's just what mum is like.""  One thing that really got to me when I was telling the Dr all the things my mum did to me as a child I stopped and said ""Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad"" and straight away she informed me: ""Children are incredibly resilient and will find happiness in all types of situations."" I felt sad hearing that.    

My grandma is my mum, in my mind. She took care of me and gave me a happy and safe environment. I am so thankful and lucky to have her in my life, if it wasn't for her I wouldn't be able to go on. She doesn't hug me like my mum does or say ""I love you"" like my mum does. That doesn't matter, I can just feel the real love she gives. 

Strangely enough, I care for my mother a lot and feel sorry for her, I have more of a sibling relationship with my mum and I learnt how keep her happy by this age to make my life easier (when my childhood dog died she was hellish to be around, I saved money and used savings to get her a puppy for Christmas, she had also suffered a miscarriage and I just wanted to make her feel happy again) . I do love her, I just don't think she was/is a good mum (single mother and only child) and has issues that have never been addressed. Everyone who 'knows' my mum think she's great fun and very easy to get along with, only me and my grandma know what she's like behind closed doors. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this, I never aired it out publicly or even thought about it this intently, I'm just a shocked... To anyone reading, if you have similar experiences and have had depression all your life without realizing - 

Go and get help if you can. It's been an excruciating to get to this point validation and I wish I went sooner. Much sooner. My family and especially my grandmother are against medication and have that attitude to life of ""You just have to keep going"" and ""Laugh and the world with laugh with you, cry and you will cry alone."" Which is why I did just carry on until I broke.

Between starting and graduating HS all of these things occurred in my life

\- 3/4 grandparents & all my family pets died

\- my mom & stepdad's relationship became toxic & emotionally abusive. Stepdad began openly cheating on my mom, & eventually abandoned us & refused to pay child support to my younger brother (his son)

\- younger brother developed severe behavioral issues that disrupted home life & often required police intervention

\- mom developed PTSD, dumped all her trauma on me, & would frequently threaten to kill herself 

\- mom lost her job. We went from middle class to food insecure & almost became homeless 

I know that lots of people have gone through far far worse, & i know i'm weak & pathetic for letting this impact me, but i truly believe that the combo of puberty + all this events happening in a relatively short amount of time rewired my brain & caused permanent depression. 

Now i'm in my early 30s & no matter how good things are going in my life there's still this pervasive sadness & hopelessness underneath it all. I used to be studious, motivated, & organized. Now i struggle to get myself to go work my low-paying but easy job. My apartment's a mess. I forget to pay bills. I have no hobbies or interests beyond mindless internet surfing, & have the attention span of a goldfish. I'm lazy & selfish & wish i could cease existing. Everything seems ultimately pointless.

Of course, as a kid I never knew this, just knew something felt off and thought I was different. 

I grew up hearing and internalizing things like: 
You're not working to your potential
You're so lazy
You quit when anything becomes hard
You can do it, you just choose not to
You should have... done better, picked up your room, dressed for the occasion, stuck with it, etc. etc. 

My parents divorced when I was 3. My mom said I used to stare into the reflection on the dishwasher (there was no stainless steel appliances in the 80's kiddos, but also...WTF) waiting for my dad to come home. He left mom for the secretary, a much younger woman. He did come back though, every Wednesday night and weekend, per the custody agreement. Soon, I had myself a new family at Dad's... his new wife and the two kiddos they had together (my half sis and bro who I now adore). 

Started drinking and drugging around 14 to ease the pain. The pain of what, I don't know. Except to say that I never felt good enough. My self-esteem was (and is) always in the shitter and my self-worth is zilch. I've always had a ton of guilt for not being a better Mom, daughter, friend, sister, wife - whatever. I literally am never good enough or so it feels. 

I sobered up at 28. Had two kiddos of my own and endured a divorce without drinking. This is a big deal for a blackout drinker. 

So why, (why?!) do the feelings of worthlessness never leave? My life history in a nutshell (apropos, bc I feel nutty errrr'day) is damn near normal for many Americans. In fact, it's probably better than the majority! 

I feel guilt over feeling depressed, but what the fck. I can't shake this. I hate myself at least 90% of the time. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'll never accomplish anything, I don't deserve to be here and I'm hopeless.

My mom is abused as a child
My dad grew up fatherless

My mom and dad had kids when they were teens then married young.

My dad had a series of affairs when I was young and I saw how that broke my mom.

I saw my mom in a catatonic stage once.
She never talked about it or explained it to me, even when I was growing up.

My dad once told my mom he wasn’t coming home. So my mom made me and my older sister beg my dad to come home.

I grew up in a small home with lots of relatives living in close quarters. They were a lot of issues. I had an aunt who moved out of the house when she was still in high school, there were a lot of screaming and fighting. 

I was bullied when I was in elementary for being different. I had close friends growing up, I was the outsider in a group. 

In high school, I was misunderstood for being aware of my sexuality at a young age. Nobody really guided me, but I was shamed and called names even by adults when what I needed at the time was proper knowledge with the changes happening to me and my body.

I was sexually abused when I was in high school by my boyfriend at the time. I didn’t know better back then, I didn’t know it was serious.

When I was in college, I felt more depressed. I was in a bad relationship that was mentally and emotionally abusive. And, I was having a hard time fitting in at my college and my chosen course. My parents didn’t know what was going on, and they weren’t helpful at all.

My mom and dad served in a church. 
I used to serve in a church too, but the people were not as good as I thought. I was vulnerable and trusting, I was not aware of the reality in my situation.

My mom & dad spent a lot of time serving at the said church, my dad preached while my mom stood by his shadow. They fight a lot because of the issues with their church group, sometimes I feel like my dad focuses on his preaching than actually being present with what is happening to me.

My family isnt perfect and I have a complicated relationship with them.

I was forced to see my mom in a different light and I didn’t like what I saw. She was different than what I thought she was.

My mom has a lot of issues that she passed down on us. My dad has a lot of issues that he passed down on my mom. It’s a cycle.

I feel like i’m the only person in our family that sees this cycle and that made me feel more alone than ever. I have no friends and my boyfriend, while being loving and caring, is not very aware of my situation as he grew up differently and is closer to his parents than I was with mine.

I am always angry because I see things differently, I was the outsider as a child and I am an outsider as an adult.

I am very depressed.
I think about suicide on the daily.
I read and watch a lot of contents about suicide. I’m finding reasons to justify why I should proceed with my suicidal planning.

I am scared and frankly, at the same time, calmed with the idea of being gone.

I am scared because I am finding the courage to end my life. I feel like when I take my life, my family will finally learn a lesson and do things differently to my siblings. I feel like my death will be a wake up call for them, and a solution for me.

I think my death is essential for the change that is needed in our family. Everyday I am having more and more courage to accept that.

I am justifying my suicide and that’s ok for me.

According to her, she had been hospitalised after taking 1,500 aspirin and waiting three days to tell anyone. I’ve always been pretty into medicine, so I knew that if that was true she would have bled to death internally very fast, but I didn’t want to start an argument. 

And so began a campaign of some of the most ridiculous behaviour I have ever witnessed.

Right off the bat, she told me that she’d had over 1,000 suicide attempts. This was obviously not particularly believable to start with, but soon I realised that the bar for was qualified as a “suicide attempt” to her was incredibly low. Here’s a list of only SOME of the things she did that she described as suicide attempts:

- Putting her own hands around her neck and squeezing 
- Holding her breath for as long as possible
- Taking four paracetamol
- Gently head butting a wall
- Scratching her arms with her fingernails
- Sticking a pencil up her nose and waiting for someone to notice, then pretending she was going to slam her head into the table
- Swallowing a bead

In addition to this, she pretended to be a heroin addict, and when I asked how she injected the heroin, she mimed injecting the muscle of her upper arm like a vaccine.

Other assorted lies included that she had an identical twin from whom she was separated at birth, and that she had killed a man.

The worst thing she did when I was there actually resulted in me breaking down quite badly. I had a delusion that there were worms eating my brain, and she managed to persuade me that she’d caught the worms off me, and now she was going to die and it was all my fault.

She got discharged unceremoniously a few weeks into my stay, and last I heard of her, she quizzed a girl at the patient’s reunion about her CSA trauma so brutally that said girl jumped into a river.

And that’s only one of the fakers I encountered during my distinguished career as a teenage mental patient. I’ll tell you about the others some other time.",1662223991.0,suicide

My name is Val (not my real name), I’m 15 and I stopped faking DID a year ago. Before you get any further into reading this post, I’d like to set a few rules for commenting:

* Do not send me validation (“This wasn’t your fault” “You were young” etc.). I’ve been debating making this post because I still crave the validation mentioned in my story, but in order to fully close this shitty chapter of my life I feel compelled to share my experience to hopefully stop others from going through what I went through. 
* Do not post self-validation: If you identify as a system, don’t post “Well I’m a real system because x and y”. If you feel the need to validate yourself, you are exactly who this post is meant for. I understand why you want to comment these things but I ask you to set that urge aside for 10 minutes and just read what I have to say
* **I am NOT looking for advice** about **ANY** part of my life that I have shared here. This rule is very much being disrespected and I would appreciate for it to be followed going forward 

This post is long but I just ask you to bear with me. **If you feel that it is too long for you I understand and wish you a good day, but ask you not to downvote it for its size**. With all of that being said, here is how and why I faked DID and what effects it has on my life now. Have a fun read.

I discovered DID when I was 12 in 2020 through Anthony Padilla’s DissociaDID video and binged all of their videos while I was depressed during lockdown. I was going through (like a lot of people) an incredibly difficult time of my life, suicidal, isolated, getting back into self-harm after being clean for years. I was introduced to the concept of PTSD through DissociaDID and started “realizing” that I had it (I’ve been diagnosed with nothing and refuse to self-diagnose in any way). Trauma was resurfacing, relatively shallow things like bullying and childhood emotional neglect. I followed ‘systems’ on Instagram and joined Discord to finally be able to talk to people again. The servers were filled with unstable teenagers. It absolutely sucked, we were each other’s therapists, they were constantly telling me how they wanted to kill themselves, telling me about their self-harm, their eating disorders. There were a decent number of suicide scares and alleged attempts.

One day, someone started saying they had DID.

I was constantly disassociating from myself, feeling empty and severely suicidal, I had one attempt. There was one night during the summer when my family and I were staying in a hotel (before anyone mentions it, yes, disrespecting covid guidelines), where it was too warm to sleep and I was in a feverish delusional state. I fully knew what I was doing was wrong. I got a notebook and wrote down the names, ages and genders of my ‘alters’. I think there were initially 12: children, adults, teens, one or two fictional characters. I definitely took a page out of DissociaDID’s alter intros' book. 

I created a new Discord account, joined the server and immediately posted introductions for every one of my ‘alters’. For the next month, I lied about my life and my trauma, I would answer questions about DID that I knew nothing about. I’ve always had a privileged life with a stable household. The only serious abuse that I am aware of now was sexual abuse at the hands of a family member but this wasn’t something I knew back then. But because I knew DID could only be caused by horrid trauma, I just made it up.

I said that my mother was a Christian fanatic, that I got in a car accident. I felt horrible and paranoid about people finding out I was lying but to me this seemed like the only way out.

I started weeding in actual things from my life: self-harm, suicidality, body issues. It stopped being a character I played and over time the fake trauma was erased and replaced by my real, considerably less severe trauma. It was becoming me and eventually, I was completely convinced that I actually had DID. I was addicted and obsessed with Discord, it became my entire life. My social and academic life crumbled, I would be roleplaying as anime characters in class, on the bus, at home, everywhere. I had no hobbies except for Discord, I stopped making art and had no friends or loved ones. 

Then came the system servers. I initially joined a handful and they were absolute cesspools of echo chambers, manufactured drama and horrible people with horrible advice. A completely new world of people saying that they had 70, 100, or over 500 alters was revealed to me, at that point having amassed around 30 alters and using Pluralkit with aesthetic, detailed descriptions for a decent number of my alters.

**THE PEOPLE**

The (confirmed) oldest people I met in those servers were 31, 30 and in their late 20s. All of them had this sense of entitlement about them: They were the oldest, the smartest, they had the last word and everyone listened to them. They were also the most immature and horrid people I had ever met. The 31-year-old constantly cried about how stressful owning a system server was, how they wanted to kill themselves, finding ways to blame it on the teenage members. The 30-year-old, alarmingly and illegally, stalked a 16-year-old member by finding their legal name on their PayPal and contacting their parents, because they had drama online. I remember 20-year-olds having DDLG fetishes. It was a breeding ground for grooming. And I briefly fell victim to it, being pressured into very sexual talk with someone who was older than me, who also groomed other young members into the same trap. 

There were also adults who I considered at the time as being rational: they would falsely correct you on medical aspects of the disorder you convinced yourself you had, always with the same sense of entitlement and superiority, because they were so knowledgeable. 

Everyone else was a teen like me, with something definitely wrong with them, but that thing not being DID. We listened to everything the adults told us. It was kind of sad, I met a lot of people who, if they had not fallen into the same self-diagnosis trap as I had, could have gotten the correct help they needed in real life and would have found actual friends. We were all close, sharing secrets we told each other, shenanigans we did in general chat and movie nights. Our alters multiplied, as did our self-diagnoses. Our alters got more creative, if someone was using crazy pronouns, everyone else had to step up their game and do it as well. Absurdity isn't absurd anymore when everyone is doing it. There were so-called ‘traumalympics’, people dumping trauma on each other in an attempt to one-up, to be the sickest. I remember being pressured into drinking hard liquor in an attempt to show one of my ‘friends’ that they were not alone and that there were others like them who were sick. However, some people were kind and would try to help each other by providing self-harm recovery resources and other helpful things of the sort.

**THE THINGS THEY WERE SAYING**

* “DID requires any kind of trauma” became “DID requires severe trauma”, so we deluded ourselves into thinking our trauma was severe enough to create DID, and the word ‘abuse’ lost all meaning. Drama = abuse, questioning things = abuse, disagreeing = abuse
* Diagnosis was a gold star and a badge of approval, recovery is bad/undesired and one should always be a system. ‘Fusion’ is evil, and being one person is almost equal to murder
* Introjects (to us this term meant fictional characters or famous people) and polyfragmentation (to us this meant systems with a bunch of alters with super intricate and developed personalities) were the most common and normal thing in the world and magically everyone had hundreds of alters overnight
* Everyone else is responsible for handling your triggers and walking on eggshells around you. If they don’t, that’s abuse. I remember some servers having ‘trigger lists’, which were bullet lists of things that were banned from being said in servers, with dozens of entries, ranging from general topics to the word ‘ok’. If you slipped up, you would be shamed 
* Reality checking and ‘fakeclaiming’ is bad. People should let you rot in your delusions, and if they don’t then they are abusers and you should avoid them
* “If you were faking, then you wouldn’t be questioning whether you are faking, because you already know” was the most damaging of them all. The number of people I have seen be on the edge of breaking out of their delusions only to be pulled back into the nightmarish pit of validation by strangers with the same craving and addiction is heartbreaking.
* Self-diagnosis, in every single case, is good. Any symptom is always equal to a disorder that has to be labeled and put into a pretty jar that you show off to everyone who comes across your messages in the alter-introduction channel
* Subreddits (like this one) are evil, hateful places that you should never go to, never look at, never consume and never dare agree with

If you were to disregard any one of these (un)spoken rules, you were called an abuser or fakeclaimer, cast out, bombarded with people convincing you that you are wrong and that your intentions are malicious and you are a hateful person. Any slight misstep could end with you being stabbed in the stomach by adults who you saw as the gods of these digital cults. 

Like so many, in an attempt to garner validation, I would shove myself into however or whatever would hear me out. I would post DID content on Tumblr and Instagram, I would post self-validation on this subreddit or r/SystemsCringe (how the turntables) and would freak out if anyone called out my bullshit. At some point, I had around 300 'alters', was self-identified as a 'polyfragmented introject heavy OSDD-1b system', and would try to convince anyone that I could that this was a very rational thing for me to be.

After a year of faking DID, I left all of these big servers, probably over some drama that meant nothing. I deleted all of my DID-oriented social media (which was an incredible decision) and stayed in small servers of ‘systems’ that were less cult-ish, but were still validation farms for their owners. Unbelievably, away from the echo chambers we were used to, we actually start gaining common sense. It was difficult, but many of us started accepting that we don’t and never have had DID, that we are simply sick in a different way. For some of us, often the ones in therapy, with real friends or support systems, the transition to being a single person again was easier. For others, like me, it was more difficult. It had been a year and a half that I had been faking DID, and my transition began with the deletion of most alters from my Pluralkit, keeping only the ‘active’ ones, until I deleted my Pluralkit entirely, which single-handedly put me on track for getting my life back. I made real friends, stopped saying I was a system on Discord until one day I could say, without fear of being hated and shamed, that I wasn’t.

I felt horrible about what I had done. I knew that it was a moment of desperation, a shared delusion I was unfortunate enough to have been sucked into. But honestly all I could think about was what people with real DID have to go through on a daily basis. No medical textbook I had read, no interview I had watched would ever be able to cover the horrors of their daily lives and I felt ashamed of ever trying to mimic their lives in a vain attempt to get the love I was craving.

And I felt empty.

My alters were so distinct, they all had likes and interests that no longer felt appealing to me. I didn’t know what music I liked, what things I wanted to eat, what I wanted to be called or what clothes I wanted to wear. It used to come so naturally with whatever alter I thought I was any given morning but now that I knew I had always been all of them nothing came to mind. I would look for symptoms in everything. It is a mindset that is difficult to this day to get rid of. There is a lot that I haven't mentioned, but I'm not going to post about this again, maybe I'll write a book some day or something (kidding, I hope not)

I am doing better now, I have friends, my relationship with my parents has significantly improved. I deleted Discord in September of 2022, which was the best decision I have ever made. I am still suffering mentally, but I am 4 months (!) self-harm-free. I am considering coming out as transgender and getting treatment for my mental health.

My social skills are recovering and I am finally learning things about myself. I still think about how easy it used to feel, and I do want to go back sometimes. DID faking was surprisingly similar, to me, to what an addiction feels like, but I have set my mind to never relapse into it.

If you are reading this and you identify as a system, I am not here to dismiss you or your symptoms. All I ask is for you to put down your social media for a week and reflect. Don’t think about symptoms and what they mean, think about who YOU are as a person. 

Who are you without whatever disorder you believe you have?

No matter who you are, you are loved and cherished by someone out there. And if there is no one, there is me. 

I’m ready to move on.

Update:

Felt the need to respond to a few recurring theme in the comment section:

""Kids will be Kids"" is not, and never will be, a good reason for doing things like this. I do not care if you are 14 or 30, there needs to be consequences for these actions. Being young does not excuse behavior, and bad actions need to be dealt with. An apology is never good enough for repeated and intentional behavior.

Yes I remember being a Kid for the most part. I also remember ""Boys will be boys"". Usually said after I was assaulted, or harassed, or had things stolen. Boys allowed to do horrible things all because ""They just don't know any better."". 

Ya'll are no different than the ""Adults"" in these situations except now it is gender neutral, and everyone gets let off the hook.

""They didn't kill anyone, chill out."" seems to be echoed a few times. They may not have pulled a trigger or stabbed someone, but do you really think that fakers have no blood on their hands? How many suicides do you think are the direct result of these fakers making people who live with these disorders lives harder? 

In a world where the stigma around mental health needs no help, these fakers feel the need to offer it anyways. They spread dangerous misinformation and perceptions which are not just isolated to their echo chambers. Which they do by choice.

Just to be clear, everyone saying I need to ""chill"" has the situation grossly misunderstood. This is about as ""chill"" as I can be given the situation, and honestly I would say I have kept a really cool head in the face of some very ignorant things coming my way.

Due to how this just kind of went nuts, I am going to be putting this baby to sleep on my end.

Thank you to everyone who actually added to the discussion without being insulting and petty. I read all of the comments and thank you for your well thought out points. Even if I do not agree fully with you, I see where a lot of you are coming from and appreciate the points of view.

My friend thinks they have BPD and they are self diagnosing with it. (we are under the age of 15) From what I have researched, you shouldn't and couldn't be diagnosed with BPD and most personality disorders as minor, and the fact they are self diagnosing makes it no better. 

They keep forcing symptoms and saying thinks like ""Omg, you're probably abandoning me, I'm sorry if I'm wrong, It's my BPD 😕"" ""You're keeping things from me 🥺"" ""You probably all hate me"". They also flex their BPD, like when I talk about mental health, they always dance and shit and say ""So me, My BPD is so crazy"". 

And whenever I try to talk about my mental health, they make it all about them. I can't even talk to them anymore bro.

Can someone give me advice on this and tell me if they're faking? I'm not even sure but I don't think at their age they should be saying they have this disorder or self diagnosing with it.

Back when this stuff first started, the trend was depression and anxiety. People accepted these diagnoses as sufficient explanations for their suffering as they were still viewed as incredibly serious conditions.

However, they were continually “watered down” as more people jumped on the trend and claimed depression and anxiety. The accounts you started to see online equated Normal Human Emotions to the level of clinical depression or anxiety. Nowadays, most people (especially teens) don’t seem to view the disorders as genuinely debilitating conditions. If the influencers with depression can get out of bed, function exceptionally well, and keep up with obligations, why can’t you when you have the same diagnoses as them? 

Clearly what you have is much more severe than what they have. So it can’t just be regular old depression. It has to be something **worse**.



You can see this pattern playing out in real time with the whole ADHD and autism thing. Initially, ADHD was the trend. People who were INCREDIBLY successful and functional were getting diagnosed and became the loudest voices in the community. So if you **can’t** do those things, it must be something worse. So everyone started to say it was “severe” ADHD. Or that they had ADHD-C. But after those terms were co-opted by fakers or those with more mild presentations, they too were viewed as not “bad enough” to explain the issue someone was having.


So it must be comorbid autism and ADHD. And the cycle continues.",1674404078.0,depression

I (48F) am the mom of a 15 years old girl that has convinced herself she has autism rather than facing the fact that she has depression. 

My daughter has always been a very emotional and sensitive kid. Her family situation has not been the best since me and her father were separated when I learned I was pregnant. I told her father because I think it was the ethical thing to do and told him that whatever decision he would make, I would completely respect. I was happy that he decided he wanted to be a father. From 3 months old, even though I was breastfeeding, she would spend the weekend with her father so she could form a strong attachment bond with him. 


It all went pear shaped when I went back to work when she was one years old because I could barely spend quality time with her during the week and she would be with her dad on weekends. He accused me of trying to take his daughter away from him and started a war that would last 12 years. I also discovered during this time that her father was a narcissistic person. 

When my daughter started school, I was already pretty sure that she had dyslexia and testing pretty much confirmed it. Her father was pretty angry at this diagnosis. His attitude pretty much made our kid more anxious but after a time we were able to get the help that she needed for school. (His anger probably came from the fact that he himself never finished high school, probably because he suffer from dyslexia and never got the help he needed at the time)

Fast forward to today, I have DD during school weeks and he has 3 weekend out of the month. I would say since 2020, COVID and all that jazz, my social butterfly of a daughter turned very isolated. Since a few months, she barely leave the room, barely interact. 

She is a teen you might say so those things are normal but she started questioning her sexuality, then started to act more and more ""autistic"" .

While it never bother her to be in a noisy room, now it bother her too much to function. She say that she has no emotions ,(while crying at the drop of the hat) .

I am convinced my daughter is depressed. I had depression, depression is in the family. I know depression. She never had any sign of autism but now act and react like an autistic person. Texture of food is bothering her (while she was a picky kid, it never bothered me that much and I could get her to eat a diverse diet) 

While some of the things like her hating wearing socks and shoes could be signs of autism, I took it more as a quirk than a nuisance. 

Sometimes I watch TikTok videos and even myself find that some of those particularities that autistic person have apply to me, I am aware enough to just laugh at it. I don't think anyone is neutotypical anymore, we just are a mixt of quirks .

My daughter doesn't have the ability to to distance herself from what she see on TikTok and really internalized it so much that it affect her personality. She has a psychologist that she sees regularly, I asked my daughter to stop watching TikTok of participating in autistic group.

what do you guys think?

431,7303.0,faking illness isn't always a sign of mental illness in itself,37,106mmmz,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/106mmmz/faking_illness_isnt_always_a_sign_of_mental/,3,"This whole ""a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they're faking"" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they're doing and still want to feel validated for it. 
Let me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who's probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. 
Of course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. 

See, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. 
But while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. 

It first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don't need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it's easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing ""depressed"" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today's teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren't. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. 

Then we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I'm not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that's as far as my memory goes and I'd appreciate elaboration. 

Now, it's important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it's not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I'm sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as ""damaged"". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. 

Today, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It's actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you're born with it, it's not developed from trauma... 
But anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn't identify as that) you talk to chances are she's gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it's actually so wide spread that it's unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I've tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It's incredibly depressing, and it's a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word 'depressing' just now, it's no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you'd be looked down on it for because you don't have a mental illness that implies that you've went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don't even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that's developed from lots of trauma and it's kind of just assumed that you're living a ""hellish life"".

Now back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they're in. It's just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. 
You're not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that's causing you to be an attention seeker. You're faking because it's simply what everyone around you is doing, it's what's deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it's what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. 
That does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren't the reason they're faking. 
And that's honestly not even those teens' faults. I'm sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it's important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. 

These people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you've been struggling with for years. But here's the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;
Being medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you're going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there's actually very few mental illness that cannot be ""fixed"". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. 
But all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a ""thropy"" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it's not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what's the point in knowing that you're a DID system if you're not going to take the time to become apart of those ""singlet"" people that you love insulting so much?

Several years ago, as they have done more research, the diagnostic criteria has improved substantially & people in their *30s & 40s* who had struggled for decades with symptoms they couldn't make sense of suddenly had the puzzle pieced together for them & it was a revelation. 

It's true a diagnosis can be cost prohibitive in one of if not the most expensive healthcare system on the planet, particularly for **adults**. Thanks to CHIP, all minors are covered by CHIP up to a very generous threshold & there are programs to ensure their mental health care is covered regardless of the parents' ability to pay. Adults don't have that same luxury. If you can't afford private or employer funded insurance, Obamacare, Medicaid/Medicare, or pay out of pocket, you're fucked. 

Pretty much all of these people have had their diagnosis confirmed by a doctor since based on access. This wasn't from people who watched a few TikTok videos but because they'd spent even *years* researching it at first. While the concept remains controversial, it was specific to autism, ADHD, etc not complex mental disorders.

My daughter & my nephew are both autistic. It's a long process of testing and conferring with specialists to reach a unanimous diagnosis, especially in children/minors because there's so much else it could be at that stage of development. She started early intervention at 3 & was diagnosed at 5. A lot went into it. 

Bipolar, any personality disorder, especially schizophrenia or DID ffs, OCD, clinical forms of depression or anxiety disorders, etc all absolutely require an official diagnosis. Very, very, *very* few laypersons understand the DSM. And still not enough compared to someone who want to school for a decade to know how to actually apply it.

Im still trying to figure out what it is, maybe it’s attention seeking, period.

Honestly if you see someone online faking disorders then try to figure as much out about them and tell their parents.

i have this ""friend"" of mine who is claiming to have a bunch of disorders (tics, ADHD, depression, anxiety and anorexia) and i wanna go over all of them a bit. they really do go to a therapist btw and apparently do have an ADHD diagnosis its still a bit sus tho  
just before i start, they say theyre nonbinary but use all pronouns, so dont bash me if i say she throughout this post, im a trans guy myself :)  
i am btw currently 14 and visit a high school ig (school where i come from is weird) but this all started in like middle school. 2021 after the huge covid break where it was homeschooling  
 they came up to me one day in school and started telling me how annoying their therapist is and that she just wants to get her depression diagnosis. this isnt how therapy works? ig? idk i didnt go to therapy yet but you dont go there and be like ""diagnose me with depression"" or smth like that. i just took it like that bc at the time, i was just trying to survive and stay closeted i was really afraid due to anxiety issues but thats not the topic. but her depression came out of nowhere with no apparent trigger? and they didnt really show any symptoms and the only thing they really did was c\*t themselves and making jokingly plans about s\*!cide (i say theyre jokes bc she was \*always\*  laughing when this was happening and took it really lightly, which was and still is pretty triggering for me and makes me really uncomfortable) and they never actually got diagnosed with it.  


next i wanna go over their anxiety and panic attacks and shit. i suffer from panic attacks etc too and i know it looks different for every person, but they litereallly used it as an excuse. im gonna take for example one story from last year, im just gonna call them ""S"": it was just a regular morning and we had class with a teacher we both dont like for reasons that i dont want to talk abt. so S just went up to that teacher, stating that they have a panic attack and need to go outside with me to calm down, which my teacher would do bc she is understanding with stuff like this. so me and S went outside so they could ""calm down"" and it was so annoying. she was just walking around me in a circle which made me really uncomfortable bc i felt trapped, which i tried to say but they didnt stop. and they were all chit chatty and laughy and it didnt feel at all like they were doing bad, until the teacher came outside to check on them. then ofc evetrhing was abd again and they could in no way go inside nonono. they did that again when the teacher came back again but then even she had enough of that bs and made us go inside. so yea they def be faking that/overdramatizing that one  
their anorexia might have legit  symptoms alltough they kinda just dropped that one at one point and eat completely normal again now

now my ""favourite"" thing that S was faking (this is sorta a 2 in one but with the ADHD i am not sure theyre faking, it might be legit. their experiences/symptoms are just different then mine i suppose.)  
anyway, buckle up for this amazing/s story  
this also happened 2021 when we came back to school, all of this did, she probably just spent too much time on tt during quarantine lmao.  
anyway, at some point completely randomly S started claiming they have tics. at first it was nothing severe, just some head jolts or maybe a hand movement, nothing severe, nothing ""special"". my best friend and my boyfriend both have a tic disorder so i didnt mind and i was used to it. at first S claimed it was tourettes, which would be like the most plausible thing to say when you claim to have tics i suppose (not saying that this is justified, im just trying to think with her mind or smth). after a while this all started to get more severe, vocal tics started to accur on a regullar basis up until a point where i could have ""conversations"" with their tics. the ""best"" part of this tho that suddenly their tics werent tourettes anymore, it was their ADHD. I am not sure that they are faking it, and apparently she did get a diagnosis for it but the tics they had were too severe to be from their ADHD. it can in rare cases cause minor tics, but not tics of this severety. they were also only ticcing when it was convient for them and suddenly all out of nowhere when they got medication for adhd, not a single tic ever to be seen again.

i am very sorry for this rant, i know this is supposed to be a memey cringey subreddit, but this has been on my mind for a while and i felt like putting this here since i am in a very bad mental place and this is still sorta going on and also some other shit with S is going on that doesnt belong here tho.

Even though he’s younger, he was very emotionally abusive with me but i also find it hard to move on. For my background, i have been in and out of mental institutions since i was 16 and I’m 21 now. I am professionally diagnosed by actual doctors. I struggled with clinical depression and severe social anxiety through my teenage years on top of being on the spectrum and it’s still hard now. And when anybody self diagnoses or fakes mental illnesses i look down on them really hard. 
Sorry for the long prologue,but anyway
since the very beginning of thế relationship, he would casually say he’s autistic everytime i struggled with other people. And after awhile he’d say he was bipolar when it was actually more similar to girls when we PMS.I tried to get used to that. And after the breakup, during his “apology” he actually said i wasnt the problem but his DID. And i was just so embarrassed. Because we live in an place where the doctors here dont even have the authority to diagnose something so rare and severe like that. i had to go to another state just for my diagnosis for autism  and my other problems but it felt so insulting for him to fake something like a child. He is younger but much too old to be in this faking phase. I cringe everytime  i’m reminded.

She was cool in my teenage mind—she painted her nails black, and wore eyeliner, and she was pretty funny. Once we became closer friends, she started sharing the tangled web of mental illness she was inside of. 

She was dating a guy who was in his thirties, acted like a total creep, and would become violently angry very quickly. She would tell “funny” stories about the various walls he punched. When I met him, he made lewd comments and suggested that I join their relationship. She explained to me that he had DID and none of his behavior was his fault. I apparently was talking to a teenage alter, so that definitely made it okay that he was propositioning a teenager. I was kind of naive and actively tried to be open-minded, so I believed her without question. With the benefit of hindsight, I think that he did not believe he had DID at all, and he just let her excuse his inappropriate behavior and tantrums. 

It turns out, she had DID too. So did her Mom. So did many of her friends. I tried my best to understand—that was my mistake. She thought she had a complex system of dozens of people, all with their own backstories and powers. She became extremely angry when I suggested that her alter, Lucifer, was not actually Lucifer but instead a facet of her. We did not speak for weeks. We only became friends again when I apologized and acknowledged that she literally had the devil living in her head. Her other alters were often from anime and various edgy shows. Unsurprisingly, many of them were very rude and selfish. Whenever something else was pulling attention from her, an alter would appear. Magic! 

We had a Skype chat where we talked to others who faked DID. I think it was quite fun for them, like role playing. I had my own problems, being a lonely and depressed kid, and I started to believe that I too had DID. I “disassociated” (felt numb) and “became someone else” (felt weird).

Before anything else, I want to make perfectly clear I do not wish any harm on this young lady and I do not know whether or not she actually has autism. No one in this subreddit knows for certain because none of us have properly assessed her in the ways only a doctor can. I will say, however, that the information she has given to the public does not make sense and has therefore caused suspicion that she is not telling the truth. I will be talking about why this suspicion came about, but before getting into that, I want to talk about why what she is doing is harmful not only to her but also to other people regardless of whether or not she actually has autism.

The majority of the people on this subreddit have been diagnosed with disorders, disabilities, and/or mental illnesses. We have experienced first-hand the consequences of other people self-diagnosing and seeking attention. There are people who have been bullied, assaulted, refused treatment, refused medication, and yes, there are people who have died because of this problem. What self-diagnosers and attention-seekers do is add to the stigma associated with disorders and mental illness. Some of you might be thinking I'm blowing this way out of proportion, but those of you who have been properly diagnosed will understand I am not, and I'd greatly appreciate you telling your story in the comments and/or providing references you may have to further educate these people who do not understand. 

Here's one reference on combatting the stigma of mental illness: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477

Notice how receiving treatment is one of the ways to combat the stigma. However, you cannot receive treatment if you have not been diagnosed by someone that's QUALIFIED to make a diagnosis. YOU are not qualified to diagnose yourself. Even if you were a doctor, you could not diagnose yourself. Even if you have a family member who is a doctor, they cannot diagnose you. This is because of ethics, which are purposefully put in place to protect patients. 

There is a reason why doctors have to go through such rigorous schooling. There is a reason why they need to be updated on research. There is a reason why many of them conduct research themselves. This is so they can learn to properly DIAGNOSE and TREAT patients. 

Are there bad doctors out there? Yep. Can doctors make mistakes? Yep. Can doctors be unsure of what to do? Yep. Does one type of doctor not know everything? Yep. 

This is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.

(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you'd think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it's not.)

Now that I'm done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I'm going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you're reading this, perhaps you'd be willing to clear a few things up. 

(I'm going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)

1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm not saying you can't look up your symptoms and go, ""Hey maybe I've got this!"" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, ""But my therapist thinks I'm autistic and other doctors too!"" Doesn't matter, they're apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That's why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. 

2. It's entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn't real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn't have. What doesn't make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. 

3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver's test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. 

4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you're paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn't make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I'm likely to get bombarded with, ""but her health insurance doesn't cover anyone else!!!!"" Definitely possible, but it'd be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that's willing to diagnose you for that much money. 

5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you're sitting in front of what you said was ""some random woman sleeping behind you."" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there's a whole lot of you going outside so... ???

I can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I'll save you some time. Yes, it's possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn't talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn't make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that'd clear things up. It's public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. 

Note: Don't go harass her on Instagram. 

A lot of things to make this long post even longer: 
Eizawolfe, you took people's money for a diagnosis, I hope that's actually what you're using it for. I also hope you squash everyone's suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you're autistic, it's not right to be speaking like you're a part of a mistreated group of people when you don't truly know if you're a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we're all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can't speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren't lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol 

If anyone's wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I've been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. 

And if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it's 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don't be shy. :')

Which is (according to Reddit’s demographics) about 90% of Reddit users. 

And my God does Reddit play a large role in this foolishness. 

Thing is, we **did** have fakers in the 80s. It wasn’t even that rare either. You had kids at school who would pretend to be dyslexic because it sounded cool, you had kids who would fake having asthma for attention. You also had kids who would exaggerate some genuine minor ailment so that they’d be known as “that kid who has ___” - whatever the condition was. In all cases it seemed to involve someone with no self-esteem and very poor social skills. 

It’s no different, in one sense from the “stolen valour” guys, or the people who pretend their dad is a cop. Or that their grandfather was a decorated war hero (that was a very common one in the 80s as most of our grandfathers had served in the War). 

Where things really exploded was with the invention of social media. Now, not only could you find an instant audience of morons gullible enough to believe you, but an entire audience of other boring, unfulfilled, dishonest people who enjoyed impersonating illnesses. Whereas in the 80s people would simply have told you to “Grow the fuck up” you now have an online world of bad actors who know they can do whatever the hell they want and get attention for it. 

What also helped the market in “I have a special condition” impersonators was the American pharmaceutical industry. What were formerly behaviours labelled “Unruly conduct” or “attention-seeking behaviour” or just plain laziness were (from the late-80s onward) increasingly pathologised until typical adolescent issues were suddenly turned into a world of abnormal psychological disorders that pharma companies could make *an absolute fortune out of*. America, by a LONG stretch, leads the world in dishing out anti-depressants and “stabilisers” to children. 

Above all, social media has created a generation of misfits who think victimhood is cool. It’s now cool to be the victim of history, the victim of your family, your school, your society, your sex, your age group, and on and on and on and on. Boy do we love a victim! 

So when you combine it all you have a perfect recipe for what we have today- impersonating illness. Nobody around to call you out in person, an entire industry telling us mental disorders are “the new norm”, a generation of people who think discussing your problems in front of total strangers is normal, and entire online communities of other Cosplay actors who share your hobby of inventing conditions and disorders. 

The icing on the social media cake is this: if anyone points out you’re fabricating an illness you can always call them a cyber bully. 

But here’s the single most disturbing factor for an old fart who grew up in the 80s: this kind of fraudulent, childish, immoral medical fakery was (prior to the internet) almost entirely the domain of children. 99 times out of 100 it was a child pulling this stunt. Today? I’d say sixty or even seventy percent of those doing this online are adults. I find that truly disturbing.",1616894514.0,depression
439,7346.0,Some conclusions I have reached about self-diagnosis,5,10ex6vj,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/10ex6vj/some_conclusions_i_have_reached_about/,7,"Since i had access to internet from a young age, like many of you, i've been part of the self-diagnosis wave that happened both on tumblr and tiktok. At first, i saw no problem with it but then i found various people claiming that it was something wrong. There were many arguments against it, and though i agreed with it being wrong, i was not satisfied with them because they wouldn't explain it as a whole. Some people would just point at self-diagnosed people as bad, and being someone who believes people are not bad natured, i wasn't satisfied and wanted an actual answer. Something that would explain why so many people crave it, why it became more popular or how to stop it. Specially for myself, since i was constantly looking for diagnosis even though i knew i shouldn't do it.

Today, after some time thinking about it, listening to other people and analysing myself, i think i've finally arrived with some answers that give me peace and can be helpful for other people. Hope you can comment whether you agree with this compilation or not. 

**Why do i think people self-diagnose?** 

Here i want to differentiate between those who are self-diagnosed and make it public, with those who don't, because the first group may have other factors to take into account. 

From what i remember, the tumblr self-diagnosis wave wasn't as scattered as this new wave is, but the recent one may show the causes behind it. Before COVID-19, mental health was pretty much taboo. People were uncomfortable talking about it, no one would actually take it as serious business, just someone being 'weak'. Then, the pandemic enabled mental health struggles to become more common. People were hurting and didn't know how to name it, what was the problem or how to make it stop. They needed answers and would eventually find posts about mental health that acknowledge their difficulties. This was completaly fine until the fast pace and quickness of social media would spread the wrong message with vague or even incorrect information. To sum up, people seek validation, attention, help through self-diagnosis but social media blurred the line between struggles and illness and as we know, people don't actually make a further investigation of what they see on social media, so most of them won't even know what DSM-V is. They just use the name that seems to describe their struggles even if they dont actually understand what the name implies. 

Nevertheless, we got other vectors when we talk about young people. For example, the search of identity  and as we know, they're more prone to seek social validation. They usually desire to be accepted by their social group, so if we mix the simplifaction of mental health, it's popularity, lack of experience and lots of isolation, the desire of an identity and some struggles that may be normal for their age, we come up with videos of people claiming that it's quirky, cute and even ""sexy"" to have autism when i don't think it's something you really want to shout out all happy about it and i'm not saying autistic people should be ashamed. I don't have autism, so i may not understand it at all and i cannot say that all people feel the same way about their divergency because it's a different experience for everybody, but there are some things that may not be enjoyable like meltdowns, or shutdowns, or being looked at when you just want to cover your needs but people won't really understand it because it can be a debilitating condition.  Obviously, i wont say that all people that self-diagnose are wrong because it's clear that there might be persons with mental illness that are not professionaly diagnosed, but i dont think it's possible to so many people to have autism, tourettes or even a complex condition as DID. 

**Do i consider self-diagnosis wrong?** 

No, but let me explain myself. I acknowledge the argument that a diagnosis may be expensive, and if you've been struggling, internet may offer you some help. At least to recognize what it may be, talk to other people about it and acoplate your life to your needs. However, i think it's extremally important to do an actual research and eventually go to a professional. Not only to confirm the diagnosis but to recieve the help that you need. Other's perspectives of you may be helpful because we tend to have a disturbed self-image, so talking about your symptoms to other people and discuss about it can give you a wider perspective about it but it's extremally important to be careful. Why? Because there is a difference between struggling and being ill. You may not want to treat someone with gastroenteritis the same way you treat someone with diabetes. They both may be hurting, they both deserve attention, but they have different needs and level of urgency. If we don't give the enough importance to mark the difference, people with severe conditions can be affected. Things like chronic depression, generalized anxiety, autism, BPD, Tourettes are daily debilitating conditions that are way more complex. I think it's better to leave big names to big conditions, to give it it's proper importance.

**Conclusion of conclusions** 

Basically, people crave attention, validation or help because they're human beings, they might be struggling and that's completaly fine, but it's important to differentiate between struggling and being ill.

My name is Val (not my real name), I’m 15 and I stopped faking DID a year ago. Before you get any further into reading this post, I’d like to set a few rules for commenting:

* Do not send me validation (“This wasn’t your fault” “You were young” etc.). I’ve been debating making this post because I still crave the validation mentioned in my story, but in order to fully close this shitty chapter of my life I feel compelled to share my experience to hopefully stop others from going through what I went through. 
* Do not post self-validation: If you identify as a system, don’t post “Well I’m a real system because x and y”. If you feel the need to validate yourself, you are exactly who this post is meant for. I understand why you want to comment these things but I ask you to set that urge aside for 10 minutes and just read what I have to say
* **I am NOT looking for advice** about **ANY** part of my life that I have shared here. This rule is very much being disrespected and I would appreciate for it to be followed going forward 

This post is long but I just ask you to bear with me. **If you feel that it is too long for you I understand and wish you a good day, but ask you not to downvote it for its size**. With all of that being said, here is how and why I faked DID and what effects it has on my life now. Have a fun read.

—

I discovered DID when I was 12 in 2020 through Anthony Padilla’s DissociaDID video and binged all of their videos while I was depressed during lockdown. I was going through (like a lot of people) an incredibly difficult time of my life, suicidal, isolated, getting back into self-harm after being clean for years. I was introduced to the concept of PTSD through DissociaDID and started “realizing” that I had it (I’ve been diagnosed with nothing and refuse to self-diagnose in any way). Trauma was resurfacing, relatively shallow things like bullying and childhood emotional neglect. I followed ‘systems’ on Instagram and joined Discord to finally be able to talk to people again. The servers were filled with unstable teenagers. It absolutely sucked, we were each other’s therapists, they were constantly telling me how they wanted to kill themselves, telling me about their self-harm, their eating disorders. There were a decent number of suicide scares and alleged attempts.

One day, someone started saying they had DID.

I was constantly disassociating from myself, feeling empty and severely suicidal, I had one attempt. There was one night during the summer when my family and I were staying in a hotel (before anyone mentions it, yes, disrespecting covid guidelines), where it was too warm to sleep and I was in a feverish delusional state. I fully knew what I was doing was wrong. I got a notebook and wrote down the names, ages and genders of my ‘alters’. I think there were initially 12: children, adults, teens, one or two fictional characters. I definitely took a page out of DissociaDID’s alter intros' book. 

I created a new Discord account, joined the server and immediately posted introductions for every one of my ‘alters’. For the next month, I lied about my life and my trauma, I would answer questions about DID that I knew nothing about. I’ve always had a privileged life with a stable household. The only serious abuse that I am aware of now was sexual abuse at the hands of a family member but this wasn’t something I knew back then. But because I knew DID could only be caused by horrid trauma, I just made it up.

I said that my mother was a Christian fanatic, that I got in a car accident. I felt horrible and paranoid about people finding out I was lying but to me this seemed like the only way out.

I started weeding in actual things from my life: self-harm, suicidality, body issues. It stopped being a character I played and over time the fake trauma was erased and replaced by my real, considerably less severe trauma. It was becoming me and eventually, I was completely convinced that I actually had DID. I was addicted and obsessed with Discord, it became my entire life. My social and academic life crumbled, I would be roleplaying as anime characters in class, on the bus, at home, everywhere. I had no hobbies except for Discord, I stopped making art and had no friends or loved ones. 

Then came the system servers. I initially joined a handful and they were absolute cesspools of echo chambers, manufactured drama and horrible people with horrible advice. A completely new world of people saying that they had 70, 100, or over 500 alters was revealed to me, at that point having amassed around 30 alters and using Pluralkit with aesthetic, detailed descriptions for a decent number of my alters.

**THE PEOPLE**

The (confirmed) oldest people I met in those servers were 31, 30 and in their late 20s. All of them had this sense of entitlement about them: They were the oldest, the smartest, they had the last word and everyone listened to them. They were also the most immature and horrid people I had ever met. The 31-year-old constantly cried about how stressful owning a system server was, how they wanted to kill themselves, finding ways to blame it on the teenage members. The 30-year-old, alarmingly and illegally, stalked a 16-year-old member by finding their legal name on their PayPal and contacting their parents, because they had drama online. I remember 20-year-olds having DDLG fetishes. It was a breeding ground for grooming. And I briefly fell victim to it, being pressured into very sexual talk with someone who was older than me, who also groomed other young members into the same trap. 

There were also adults who I considered at the time as being rational: they would falsely correct you on medical aspects of the disorder you convinced yourself you had, always with the same sense of entitlement and superiority, because they were so knowledgeable. 

Everyone else was a teen like me, with something definitely wrong with them, but that thing not being DID. We listened to everything the adults told us. It was kind of sad, I met a lot of people who, if they had not fallen into the same self-diagnosis trap as I had, could have gotten the correct help they needed in real life and would have found actual friends. We were all close, sharing secrets we told each other, shenanigans we did in general chat and movie nights. Our alters multiplied, as did our self-diagnoses. Our alters got more creative, if someone was using crazy pronouns, everyone else had to step up their game and do it as well. Absurdity isn't absurd anymore when everyone is doing it. There were so-called ‘traumalympics’, people dumping trauma on each other in an attempt to one-up, to be the sickest. I remember being pressured into drinking hard liquor in an attempt to show one of my ‘friends’ that they were not alone and that there were others like them who were sick. However, some people were kind and would try to help each other by providing self-harm recovery resources and other helpful things of the sort.

**THE THINGS THEY WERE SAYING**

* “DID requires any kind of trauma” became “DID requires severe trauma”, so we deluded ourselves into thinking our trauma was severe enough to create DID, and the word ‘abuse’ lost all meaning. Drama = abuse, questioning things = abuse, disagreeing = abuse
* Diagnosis was a gold star and a badge of approval, recovery is bad/undesired and one should always be a system. ‘Fusion’ is evil, and being one person is almost equal to murder
* Introjects (to us this term meant fictional characters or famous people) and polyfragmentation (to us this meant systems with a bunch of alters with super intricate and developed personalities) were the most common and normal thing in the world and magically everyone had hundreds of alters overnight
* Everyone else is responsible for handling your triggers and walking on eggshells around you. If they don’t, that’s abuse. I remember some servers having ‘trigger lists’, which were bullet lists of things that were banned from being said in servers, with dozens of entries, ranging from general topics to the word ‘ok’. If you slipped up, you would be shamed 
* Reality checking and ‘fakeclaiming’ is bad. People should let you rot in your delusions, and if they don’t then they are abusers and you should avoid them
* “If you were faking, then you wouldn’t be questioning whether you are faking, because you already know” was the most damaging of them all. The number of people I have seen be on the edge of breaking out of their delusions only to be pulled back into the nightmarish pit of validation by strangers with the same craving and addiction is heartbreaking.
* Self-diagnosis, in every single case, is good. Any symptom is always equal to a disorder that has to be labeled and put into a pretty jar that you show off to everyone who comes across your messages in the alter-introduction channel
* Subreddits (like this one) are evil, hateful places that you should never go to, never look at, never consume and never dare agree with

If you were to disregard any one of these (un)spoken rules, you were called an abuser or fakeclaimer, cast out, bombarded with people convincing you that you are wrong and that your intentions are malicious and you are a hateful person. Any slight misstep could end with you being stabbed in the stomach by adults who you saw as the gods of these digital cults. 

Like so many, in an attempt to garner validation, I would shove myself into however or whatever would hear me out. I would post DID content on Tumblr and Instagram, I would post self-validation on this subreddit or r/SystemsCringe (how the turntables) and would freak out if anyone called out my bullshit. At some point, I had around 300 'alters', was self-identified as a 'polyfragmented introject heavy OSDD-1b system', and would try to convince anyone that I could that this was a very rational thing for me to be.

After a year of faking DID, I left all of these big servers, probably over some drama that meant nothing. I deleted all of my DID-oriented social media (which was an incredible decision) and stayed in small servers of ‘systems’ that were less cult-ish, but were still validation farms for their owners. Unbelievably, away from the echo chambers we were used to, we actually start gaining common sense. It was difficult, but many of us started accepting that we don’t and never have had DID, that we are simply sick in a different way. For some of us, often the ones in therapy, with real friends or support systems, the transition to being a single person again was easier. For others, like me, it was more difficult. It had been a year and a half that I had been faking DID, and my transition began with the deletion of most alters from my Pluralkit, keeping only the ‘active’ ones, until I deleted my Pluralkit entirely, which single-handedly put me on track for getting my life back. I made real friends, stopped saying I was a system on Discord until one day I could say, without fear of being hated and shamed, that I wasn’t.

I felt horrible about what I had done. I knew that it was a moment of desperation, a shared delusion I was unfortunate enough to have been sucked into. But honestly all I could think about was what people with real DID have to go through on a daily basis. No medical textbook I had read, no interview I had watched would ever be able to cover the horrors of their daily lives and I felt ashamed of ever trying to mimic their lives in a vain attempt to get the love I was craving.

And I felt empty.

My alters were so distinct, they all had likes and interests that no longer felt appealing to me. I didn’t know what music I liked, what things I wanted to eat, what I wanted to be called or what clothes I wanted to wear. It used to come so naturally with whatever alter I thought I was any given morning but now that I knew I had always been all of them nothing came to mind. I would look for symptoms in everything. It is a mindset that is difficult to this day to get rid of. There is a lot that I haven't mentioned, but I'm not going to post about this again, maybe I'll write a book some day or something (kidding, I hope not)

I am doing better now, I have friends, my relationship with my parents has significantly improved. I deleted Discord in September of 2022, which was the best decision I have ever made. I am still suffering mentally, but I am 4 months (!) self-harm-free. I am considering coming out as transgender and getting treatment for my mental health.

My social skills are recovering and I am finally learning things about myself. I still think about how easy it used to feel, and I do want to go back sometimes. DID faking was surprisingly similar, to me, to what an addiction feels like, but I have set my mind to never relapse into it.

If you are reading this and you identify as a system, I am not here to dismiss you or your symptoms. All I ask is for you to put down your social media for a week and reflect. Don’t think about symptoms and what they mean, think about who YOU are as a person. 

Who are you without whatever disorder you believe you have?

No matter who you are, you are loved and cherished by someone out there. And if there is no one, there is me. 

I’m ready to move on.

We believe that M is faking disorders, specifically D.I.D.

M has been showing these symptoms as of this year, and has had no alarming symptoms of D.I.D. prior to this year, however M does have a history of supposedly faking other mental illnesses. M has claimed that her system used to contain about 70 alters, however her alleged ex-boyfriend, which was one of her alters, went on a killing spree, killing about 64 alters. M seems to show very severe D.I.D., despite her young age. It is notable that she is an adolescent, and the fact that M seems to present very severe symptoms of the disorder, and not to mention out of the blue, seems very fishy indeed.

Personally, I find that if she is in fact, faking disorders, very insensitive to those that suffer from this disorder, as well as her history with replicating disorders leans towards her truly faking.

Although this is just a brief explanation of how she is seeming to fake disorders, my real question is may I call her her out on this? And if so, how can I call her out?",1664530070.0,mental_disorder
442,7449.0,My thoughts as to why youth are faking disorders,113,11g9oc6,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/11g9oc6/my_thoughts_as_to_why_youth_are_faking_disorders/,31,"The underlying commonality between all fakers is that they have interest in the disorders/illnesses. They learn about it avidly with the internet at their hands. Gen Z / today’s youth appear to be really interested in these disorders/conditions, and think they are cool. Today’s youth are infatuated with rare deviations of character/human nature. They all think these conditions are really cool, and admirable to have. Gen Z really values diversity and gives more attention to the uncommon people over the common people, finding deviations to be fascinating. There is nothing wrong with finding psychiatry and health conditions interesting, or having appreciation for people who are afflicted.

This generation of youth appear to think being different IS much more cool than not being different. Which this perception was the other way around for older generations. Older generations weren’t friendly or interested toward people with rare conditions by genetics/whichever cause. Older generations were more interested in blending in with the normal people than being an outcast, being an outcast was perceived to have consequences in society.

Gen Z like people who would have been outcasts. Gen Z is very inclusive, yet envious of people with conditions because they view disorders/conditions as unique. Gen Z admires mental disorders because of the nature of symptoms being abnormal.

This is a flipped societal perception of people with conditions. Gen Z’s are infatuated with conditions and easily believe they understand them, which I don’t doubt they have a clue, but from the intense interest and wanting to be different with mental disorders they cling onto their hope they have these conditions and fool themselves by their imagination. They wish they had these disorders / genetic deviations. Why you may be thinking. Well, it’s a different perspective to have and all it takes to understand is to just know their perspectives. Mental disorders are fascinating that is true, but it’s also become a fad for a generation who is much more invested in genetic intricacies than generations before.

Just my thoughts. 😊 I don’t think disorder faking will be around forever, it’s a momentary fad. These teenagers will grow up and get tired of faking conditions, so they will stop but the bright side is mental health is much more appreciated by this generation than before.

Edit: I know there are a lot of negatives like disinformation and making diagnosis harder for others with actual symptoms, but I wanted to share somewhat of a positive outlook.",1677780935.0,mental_disorder
443,7453.0,I (kind of) faked a disorder for a short time a long while ago (former faker Friday if that's still a thing),108,14t84ip,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/14t84ip/i_kind_of_faked_a_disorder_for_a_short_time_a/,20,"I would like to mention before I begin that I was never really a full blown faker, never trying to play to the characteristics of my 'disorders', or talking about them to people (much). For a better explanation, just read it I guess :)

So, did anyone ever use [Quotev](https://www.quotev.com/)? Mostly it was a quiz site, where people could make quizzes of all types and share them. There was also a large portion of the user base that wrote stories, fanfiction, ect. However, it was behind the scenes where it started to get... odd.

In order to post, you had to make an account. In order to 'do' (take quizzes, read stories, ect) you didn't have to. So naturally, most people didn't. However, I was active on it and decided I'd like to make an account in order to comment on quizzes/stories, and interact with others. Naturally I won't be sharing the name of my old account, but a basic idea is that all account pages were extremely customizable, something along the lines of a MySpace page if you will. Observing other account pages, I noticed all of them involved long and detailed introductions to each person involving

* Name(s)
* Pronouns
* Gender/sexuality
* Favourite colours
* Pets
* Personal details/facts (but not too personal to make it unsafe, more things like fun facts)
* A quote of some sort (to make the page creator look intelligent haha)
* An I/DNI list
* Links to the page of a friend or two

So, I tried my best to do this. I listed all of this information to the degree I was comfortable with, and then began to explore. And what I discovered was the fakest, cringiest, most toxic community I'd ever run across. Behind the scenes, you could do all sorts - make groups (similar to subreddits, actually) with friends, or join groups with people with common interests. I immediately joined several groups, with anything from 5-8,000+ members. On some of the largest groups, I can still remember the usernames of about 10 people who, I swear, used the platform for 15+ hours a day. I would make a post, and ALWAYS, they would just be there, to comment or to argue. Anyway, I was reasonably happy. It was fun, for a while. Until I started to go deeper.

Now, as much younger as I was, I didn't really understand the concept of faking. All I saw, was people, all around me, all the time, constantly talking about their several complex mental disorders, even when it wasn't relevant to the conversation. Now, I had already listed my mental disorders, in a desire to copy the profiles of others I'd seen. I'd like to note here that I am clinically diagnosed with several moderate to severe mental disorders. Naturally, again, in the interests of privacy I will not be listing them all - only mentioning the ones relative to the story when they are. Anyway, almost every profile I saw started with an extensive list of mental disorders. I also saw a huge amount of pro self-dx, and DNI fakeclaimers/anti self-dx. So, not knowing better, I believed it, and began preaching these views to others. And, as time went on, I began to notice how sad my profile looked - how empty and plain. And, again younger as I was, I had only the foggiest clue of what different disorders meant/entailed. I have always experienced very distinct mood swings, due to severe ADHD. However, I didn't know at the time that that was the reason, so I presumed that it must be something else. As all the people around me were pro self-dx, I figured how bad could it possibly be? Therefore, I did MINIMAL research, and decided (more for the purpose of fleshing out my disorder list than anything else) that I must have bipolar, borderline personality, and for a short time, DID. DID turned out to be far too much work to fake, so I took that one off quickly. However, for a long time bipolar and borderline sat happily at the top of my list.

Fast forward, I never use Quotev anymore. It was toxic, everyone on there faked at least 3 mental disorders, and it was just generally awful. It also had a direct messaging system, where I know that many people were groomed. I recently deleted the fake disorders from my account, which is now completely dormant. The reason it took me so long was that I quite simply forgot. I am now very regretful of this short era of my life, and wish I could wipe it from my history forever. I hope that if anyone has bothered to read to the end that you can understand why I did what I did - simple peer pressure. Feeling like I wasn't 'disabled enough', like I wasn't good enough to be a part of this community. I think that my story sheds a bit of light on the reasons that some people may have for faking -  that thing of peer pressure and not belonging. I hope that in the future this kind of thing can not be allowed to go on.",1688738410.0,mental_disorder
444,7457.0,Self diagnosis isn't valid for teenagers.,245,119okf4,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/119okf4/self_diagnosis_isnt_valid_for_teenagers/,37,"Saying that diagnosis is valid has very specific roots that have nothing to do with psychological disorders. Several years ago, as they have done more research, the diagnostic criteria has improved substantially & people in their *30s & 40s* who had struggled for decades with symptoms they couldn't make sense of suddenly had the puzzle pieced together for them & it was a revelation. 

It's true a diagnosis can be cost prohibitive in one of if not the most expensive healthcare system on the planet, particularly for **adults**. Thanks to CHIP, all minors are covered by CHIP up to a very generous threshold & there are programs to ensure their mental health care is covered regardless of the parents' ability to pay. Adults don't have that same luxury. If you can't afford private or employer funded insurance, Obamacare, Medicaid/Medicare, or pay out of pocket, you're fucked. 

Pretty much all of these people have had their diagnosis confirmed by a doctor since based on access. This wasn't from people who watched a few TikTok videos but because they'd spent even *years* researching it at first. While the concept remains controversial, it was specific to autism, ADHD, etc not complex mental disorders.

My daughter & my nephew are both autistic. It's a long process of testing and conferring with specialists to reach a unanimous diagnosis, especially in children/minors because there's so much else it could be at that stage of development. She started early intervention at 3 & was diagnosed at 5. A lot went into it. 

Bipolar, any personality disorder, especially schizophrenia or DID ffs, OCD, clinical forms of depression or anxiety disorders, etc all absolutely require an official diagnosis. Very, very, *very* few laypersons understand the DSM. And still not enough compared to someone who want to school for a decade to know how to actually apply it.

I had unrestricted access to the internet at a very early age, and practically grew up online because I didn't fit in with my peers. I was always a very emotional child, and had attention seeking tendencies where I would lie or exaggerate to get people to be concerned about me. I don't remember much about my childhood, other than a few incidences and occasionally I get somatic type flashbacks that hint at sexual abuse.

When I was a young teen, my first partner ever (long distance) had DID, diagnosed (or so they claimed). They went through a lot in their early childhood, and I was dating a few of their alters. At this time, I would also ""roleplay"" as characters I made or fictional characters from media we liked, and I would talk to them and their alters as these characters. Fast forward a couple years, and i start to believe I might be a system myself. I talk to my now ex about this, and they encourage me to open up about it and talk as these alters. Most of the online communities I felt most at home at had multiple systems, and many were ""kin systems"" so I had quite a lot of introjects at the time. 

Flash forward some more years, and now I'm in my 20s. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital for 3 months last year for a variety of reasons, and I tried to seek answers from the psychiatrist about the possibility of DID, because it's rare to have such good access to a psychiatrist. After being persistent with talking to him, he told me that I don't fit the criteria for DID, but I do have OSDD. I never received any official paperwork on my diagnosis, and I never have really received paperwork (I've been diagnosed with other conditions over the years as I've been struggling with my mental health for a long time).

Now the thing is, I don't know if I've just managed to fool my psych and previous therapists because of my knowledge of DID from other means. I've always been an imitator, and I picked up a lot from the online crowd I've hung out with. I feel like my chronically online status as a young person really shaped my mental health today. I worry that this is all one big act, a lie or exaggeration that has gone on for too long. The partner I was emotionally closest to and who was two years older than me encouraged ""switching"" and ""larping"" behaviour throughout our relationship. There was a time I thought being a system was cool and a good way of coping to escape the intense emotional period of my life I was in. I don't know if the psychiatrist has to legally disclose if I'm suffering from a delusional disorder, factitious disorder, or munchausens, but I worry that it's that. 

I suffer a lot because of the dissociation and conflict of self interests. Having a dissociative disorder is awful the way I experience it, but it feels like I'm faking because it's manageable and I didn't live in extreme circumstances, just had multiple traumatic events. 

So, I guess the conclusion of this is that mental health spaces for teens has become such a big thing it can influence how mental illness progresses. A lot of kids who feel alienated and that there's something wrong with them find themselves surrounded by systems, and I think thats why there's such an increase in not only fakers, but confused cringe adults. I can't tell you if I'm faking or not, but I know i probably wouldn't have developed this disorder if I hadn't been exposed to it at such a young age (if I even have it).

EDIT: adding that I am speaking with my therapist about this, I only get psych appointments once every 2 months now but I'll also talk to them about jt",1663304166.0,mental_disorder
446,7462.0,I faked being in a system and having psychosis. (VERY Long Post),380,155xlm6,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/155xlm6/i_faked_being_in_a_system_and_having_psychosis/,75,"I know this somewhat common a post and common a situation, but I believe everyone's a fan of some change in pace here and enjoy seeing someone realize and admit that they were wrong. I will try to not give many details here, because I am VERY paranoid as this is a pretty recent development that I acknowledge I am a faker and have cut off those who encouraged me so I do not wish to give out any particular details. This is really embarrassing but I personally believe it's healthy for me to write this down and let it go. I hope that writing this allows other former fakers to come out with stories of their own or helps someone realize it's okay to admit you're faking it and they can start to recover.

**I am a former system faker and former faker of psychosis.**

To start off, I was a very chronically online kid and I learned about DID and systems from tumblr. **I was very eager as a lonely and bored kid so I had been very intrigued by the idea of being able to have basically what were imaginary friends that I could talk to. I studied up on all the system terms and information I could find on tumblr, teaching myself everything that came from people who glorified systems and misinformation.** I had known about systems and kin for a bit then and I believe at some point in middle school when I was about 13 I learned about systems and then learned about tulpamancy and tried to force myself to have alters calling them ""tulpas"" by just pretending I had them to talk to. My ""headmates"" as I called them were actually Jeff the Killer, Geno!Sans the skeleton, Killer!Sans the skeleton. I would draw Jeff the killer, calling him my older brother and pretend I was talking back and forth with Geno!Sans the skeleton in my head. **Eventually after about a week I quickly dropped them because it was really tiring to keep pretending to talk to nothing because it was so much work when I knew I could not really convince myself.**

Then as of late since 2020 or 2021 as you can see the internet has quickly popularized the idea of ""IRLS"" and ""Delusional Attatchments"" or ""D/As"". **Of course, I like everyone else leapt gladly on the opportunity to find a way to be unique and different by claiming I was a unique fictional character and the only one there was.** I knew very much that I was faking this, but my first lie was in a new kin server that I had decided to join where they had a rather long ""No doubles IRL"" list. **It was at a time where a certain character had came out very recently and I wanted to 'claim' him in my mind so other people wouldn't do it first, so I had pretended that I was a IRL of him despite knowing I had no psychosis symptoms and was not psychotic. Since everyone else was an IRL and when you were an IRL in that server you were the ONLY person who could be that character, which made you unique. I had decided I needed to be one too since I wanted to be unique and fit in with this group because I liked talking to them so much.** When I made my friends refer to me as him I always felt super uncomfortable being called him because I knew I was not him and it was very weird to have it validated without question. Then with another character I wanted to be very unique in liking so I had claimed to be a ""IRL"" of him as well. I had picked this character because he was quite minor a character in the fandom (he was a rather unpopular Homestuck character) because I wanted to fit in and I knew that I could not pick to be an IRL or a Delusional Attatchment to another character as they were all already on the no doubles list, which to me meant that someone else had 'claimed' them and they were 'taken' so I and no one else could not have them. **I would lie about my psychosis and try to force myself into psychosis. I would search online for excuses for how I was ""psychotic"" despite having no real symptoms.** Claiming anything I saw was a hallucination and since the character was an animal I'd try to literally force myself to think that I was him and force myself to behave like an animal despite knowing that I was not. **I would purposely endanger myself and try to force my thoughts because I wanted so badly to be psychotic and knew that I was not. I would spend time googling disorders that had psychosis to say I could possibly self diagnose myself with to validate myself and my ""delusion"" and ""psychosis"" that I did not have. Incredibly unsurprisingly, once I left this server because it grew very inactive, I no longer felt the need to claim I was psychotic anymore nor was I an IRL or a D/A of the character and never mentioned any of it again.**

Once again since this was quarantine with lots more focus on the internet, more and more people started claiming to be systems even more widespread on twitter, tumblr and TikTok. **I knew that I had an ACTUAL dissociative disorder and once again I was a very lonely person who enjoyed fitting in. I would spend time researching information to self-diagnose and I would come across resources that I could only have one dissociative disorder and not multiple and be very angry because the information I found went against what I WANTED which was to be validated for the disorder I did not have. All found information supported me having an entirely different dissociative disorder (DR/DP disorder, and if you have DR/DP then you automatically cannot have DID or OSDD) but I would ignore it because it did not validate and agree with my desire for being a system.** At this time I was friends with a new group of people who I had enjoyed spending time with who most of them were claiming to be systems. I saw them bond over being a ""system"" and bond over their alters. I saw them fit in together having DSMP alters, undertale alters and FNAF alters. Being a system to them was a very important personality trait and was their main personality traits. **I wanted to belong. I knew that I was not a system, I could not be, but I claimed that my symptoms were OSDD. I claimed OSDD because I knew I did not fit the amnesia part of DID because I did not have DID and never did.** However soon I found myself using letter sign offs like ""-V"" at the end of my messages. I was aware that I was nervous to use pluralkit because I knew that I did not really think I should be using it. **However this friend group and other ""system"" servers that I was joining encouraged me to use pluralkit and call myself a system. When people started agreeing with my desire and validating it, I eagerly did not look back and quickly called myself a system.**

**Like psychosis I quickly tried to FORCE myself to fit what I was told was a system.**  **I started to try to talk to nothing in my head, having back and forth conversations with ""voices"" in my head. I started trying to make them feel differently. I started having ""switches"" to characters that I never had before.** I will preface this by admitting that yes I AM an actual victim of abuse. When I would be yelled at and cried, I would hold myself and start telling myself that this was fine because it was an alter of Spinel from Steven Universe who was taking over and it was okay because we were ""switching"" now, and then get very frustrated and angry when nothing actually happened because there was no way for it to actually happen. **Despite knowing that I did not have DID I told myself I did because it made it easier to accept my life and how terrible my situation actually was.** **I started off very slowly, claiming to have only a few small amount of alters. Then very quickly I started to ""split"" more alters (all of which were fictives and factives)**. I had a ""factive"" of a popular artist on instagram (who was funnily enough an actual diagnosed system themself and I believe actually really a system so I had claimed that I had two factives of their already existing alters) and I know that I made them very uncomfortable with it (because I told them personally about it). **The ""factive"" I had of them was only because I thought that their aesthetic, appearance and art was very cool and I wanted it but didn't know how to, so claiming to literally have them as a separate person in my head was a quick solution.**

In school and when I was bored I would tell myself I could instead pretend to be someone else fronting. I would tell my friends that I was a different alter and switching. I **started using those yellow ""nonverbal stim emotes"" because everyone else used them in servers and now all of a sudden I would claim that now I was nonverbal, age regressed or a little alter.** I dated someone who ALSO claimed to be a system with DSMP fictives. I claimed to have fictives of every Dream SMP character in my system, dream, technoblade, tommy, ranboo, tubbo, all of it. I claimed to have alters of Junko, Miu, Kokichi and Nagito. I claimed to have several sans the skeleton alters, chara, frisk, gaster and grillby alters. I claimed to have sollux, gamzee, jade, john and dave alters. **Most of my ""alters"" would ""front"" for only a day or two and then I'd move onto a new one, splitting instantly when I wanted to and then forget them. I found myself from a system with 4 members to over 80 in mere MONTHS, calling myself ""polyfragmented"" (when I had ""fragments"" only because I didn't actually have alters). I would invent OCs and characters on the spot and then claim they were alters I had just discovered.** I would talk to other ""alters"" with the same ""source"" as me. I would claim my alters were speaking to each other and tell everyone the stories and things they said. My friends started talking to my ""alters"" and telling me how much they liked them. I started telling everyone I was a system, having statuses with our fronters and writing down things about them.  **I knew I had no ""headspace"", but I made one up because everyone else talked about how giant their ""headspace"" was and how they saw their alters interacting with each other and it was common in system spaces to talk about what fake activities your alters were somehow doing. I would get angry with myself because I had told myself I was a system, and the internet said all systems had magical headspaces, but I did not have one and I knew this. I could not make a headspace that I fully believed in and I knew this.**

**As I said I am an actual victim of abuse and I am actually mentally ill, awkward and autistic. (just like most fakers likely are).** The only disorders that I mainly truly had were autism (making me feel very weird and like I did not fit in), OCD (causing my compulsions and mental health paranoia) DR/DP (causing 99% of my dissasociation symptoms), bipolar and BPD **(making my emotions feeling so very extreme I would say they were my ""alters and that my emotions were different people). I wanted to fit in and as I had never really had much of a certain identity (because I was a young uncertain teen discovering myself that wanted to join in the trends that everyone else did combined with actually having no sense of myself from my BPD). I was a very lonely kid who's main comfort was the internet and spent hours and hours daily on it and using discord and tumblr, so I was beyond deeply influenced by it. I wanted to know what was ""wrong"" with me, so spending my time self diagnosing mental disorders was very coinvent for me and something I relied on. I would hyperfixate on researching one mental disorder and slowly convincing myself that clearly I had it. I did this for SPD, SzPD, ASPD, OSDD, DID and BPD where I would research to the point I started gaslighting myself unintentionally that I had these disorders because their symptoms ""made sense"" and it gave me comfort. I wanted an ""answer"" to what was wrong with me so badly, and I wanted a way to be unique and stand out in a way that was my identity that I so often would self diagnose myself. I did not use self diagnosis for anything except to reassure myself in my faking and what I knew was wrong. I had no interest in actually healing or getting better, I just used them as a way to fit in.**

I felt after saying I was a system that I could never go back to before. **No one ever talks about what you're supposed to do if you realize that you're not a system after all. They tell you how to find out that you're a system, or what to do about it. They talk to your new alters and coddle you and make you feel good and make you feel as if you only matter and fit in when you're one of them. I felt like I couldn't do anything, because now that I had said I was a system I could not go back. I felt as if I told people I didn't think I was a system after all that I would be humiliated and that they wouldn't want to speak to me anymore because I wouldn't ""fit in"" with them anymore. I had so many friends and servers where the only thing we had in common was our ""mental illness"" and if I didn't have that, then they would realize I had no use to be talking to them anymore and that nothing would matter after all, because all our interests, conversations, rants, jokes and memories involved about how mentally ill we were and how we were so different from ""singlets"" and unique.**

Now I am nearing my age of adulthood and have no interest in things like this anymore. I use this subreddit to make sure that I accept that I could never see myself going back to living like that anymore. I have left all friends who influenced me to claim the disorders, left all communities and spaces for being a system, left all system information behind and started meeting new friends who are not calling themselves systems and who will call out fakers and do not validate just anyone at random. I'm soon to be in recovery as well. I am excited to genuinely start therapy and medication and I no longer have interest to start collecting my mental illness self diagnoses like pokemon cards and am very excited for professional diagnosis. I have started finding interests and parts of my identity that make up me as one entire person instead of using my mental illness as my only trait. I look back on this very shamefully and am deeply embarrassed admitting all of this. I am fully staying away from anyone who looks to be doing the same things I did and picking my friends and communities very carefully.

**I hope anyone in a similar situation knows it's okay to want to change it. You can take the first steps you need to, no matter how slowly. You can leave all the people who encouraged you behind (because that community is beyond toxic of a space to be in, take it from me), or tell real friends that you don't think you actually have these disorders anymore and they should accept you for it and praise you for taking that step of self admittance. Get better. Be honest right now, and notice that people in these spaces NEVER recover or push for recovery and healing for themselves or for others. All they do is echo each other's opinions, encourage their disorders to be worse to be better than one each other and refuse to change. I could not heal and recover until I cut all of this out and decided to change for myself. You can and will find yourself as a person in what you really like and are interested in and what you enjoy doing, not in your mental illness. You do not have to live like this forever, and it will get better! I am beyond happy with what I've done, and I cannot see myself doing that ever again. I am healing, and I'm very grateful for it. <3**",1689967690.0,mental_disorder

A similar [report](https://images.app.goo.gl/WgUYawawVUtr1vAu6) by the CDC found increasingly poor mental health among teens.

I'm always amazed at seeing how many diagnosed individuals seemingly support this behaviour, excusing it with the extremely flawed ""they don't cause any harm"" sentiment. Misinformation is so common nowadays, and there is already enough stigmata on mental illnesses and neurodevelopmental disorders in existence. Fakers just love speaking for everyone sharing their ""diagnosis"" (e.g. ""Infantillisation doesn't affect me, it's just an inside joke/""I want to be infantilised""), and calling them out is forbidden in some of these subreddits, because it's of course ableistic behaviour. They are also the ones spreading toxic positivity, such as calling their disorder a super power, using ""neurospicy"", as well as blaming our modern/western/capitalist society for all of their issues. They don't give a duck about the harm their opinions may cause affected individuals. Because once their puberty ends and they realise that they in fact do not suffer from DID, BPD, ASPD, ADHD or autism (but from being chronically online, boredom, identity instability), most of them will be able to just walk away and never look back.

What's worse, I've seen people advocating for self-diagnosing via TikTok, portraying it as a legitimate source of information, in these communities. There's seemingly no space for people with a more ""mature"" view on this issue, you either have to co-exist with people larping as the bane of your existence or gtfo out of all supportive groups.

449,7478.0,An observation about fakers.,356,109mrkj,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/109mrkj/an_observation_about_fakers/,52,"**Recently someone posted a survey on this sub in which they asked why we think people fake disorders/illnesses. I wanted to share my response to this question with a wider audience, and ask your opinion(s) on it.**

**My mini-essay is as follows:**

When it comes to adolescents (the primary group of people faking), I believe a large majority of it is actually unintentional faking. While there are certainly a numerous amount of people who fake illnesses for attention, there is an even larger amount of people who have deluded themselves into genuinely believing they suffer from said illnesses. Since it is currently among the most commonly faked illnesses and I also have personal experience with people who are faking it or have faked it in the past, I'll use (fake) Dissociative Identity Disorder in adolescents as an example:

Most people spend a huge portion of their teenage years trying to figure out who they are. This often results in lots of change, — whether intentional or not — to oneself in order to fit into a group and/or be socially accepted. They don't feel like themselves, and they're confused, so they look around online to get an idea of what's ""wrong"" with them, and among the results find DID.  Because of their exposure to the internet's limitless information, alongside (inaccurate) media portrayals such as the movie *Split*, they have likely already been introduced to Dissociative Identity Disorder and are more likely to gravitate towards it because it's familiar. So, they pull up a symptoms checklist — and when they check off all or most of said symptoms, they assume they have the disorder because they don't have enough experience nor education in the medical field to understand that having symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have a specific disorder (as an example, people commonly check off every symptom of a concussion even if they've never had one).

Teenagers who grew up on the internet have a tendency to latch onto labels due to the fact that the internet is so heavily segregated into communities. An example of this is sexual orientation and gender; people will cycle through a multitude of labels because they crave somewhere to fit in and be accepted. The same goes for DID — the universal fear of the unknown (""what's wrong with me""), in combination with a fixation on labels, leads them to the idea of having DID.  As a result of latching onto these labels, they begin feeling a need to amplify their ""symptoms"" in public as proof that they have the disorder. This results in the heavily exaggerated stereotypes often seen on TikTok and other social media platforms where people tend to fake disorders.

Another issue stemming from these children growing up online is the fact that making a mistake, big or small, is treated as a cardinal sin because it is permanently attached to your character; everything is permanent on the internet. General teenage mistakes we used to take for granted are no longer possible for these teenagers. They can't learn from their mistakes because they aren't allowed to make any. They don't have the life experience necessary to reflect on what they're doing and admit their faults. Their primary role models tend to consist of influencers who have taught them that finding excuses and moving on is better than finding explanations and changing their behaviour.

All of these factors combined result in the faker drawing out the act for as long as they possibly can, which often leads to them being mocked, which further leads to an even stronger desire to stay in this delusion. When the validity of a faker's disorder is inevitably brought into question, they naturally tend to lash out because admitting that they were wrong would send them back to square one (not to mention that it is much more comforting for someone — especially an adolescent who is rarely taken seriously by adults — to remain wilfully ignorant than to confront the idea that they might be wrong about something). This is why the influx of social echo chambers is so prominent on social media right now, especially Reddit and TikTok.

Overall, *none of these things* excuse the misinformation and mockery created by fakers. It's incredibly disappointing to see and I sincerely hope that they can learn to accept when they make mistakes, admit their faults, and learn from them. This is simply an observation I've made, and it could possibly serve as an explanation as to why faking mental disorders is such a widely spread phenomenon on the internet.

&#x200B;

I'm curious as to what you guys think of this. Do you think faking is a result of these factors, or something else? Would you argue that most online faking is intentional/malicious? If so, why?Hoping to spark some insightful discussion :)

451,7480.0,I faked multiple disorders in the past,205,12es19k,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/12es19k/i_faked_multiple_disorders_in_the_past/,47,"I used to fake Tourette’s and DID (and many more but some of them I genuinely think I have and it would be too hard to list them)

I was 10 when I first stumbled across this phenomenon. Like many others, I started faking during Covid. First it was DID.

I had stumbled upon Anthony Padilla’s “I spent a day with MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES” video (I saw the other post and they found it the same way 0: )

After that I started googling it and I learned a fuckton about it. I watched like all of DissociaDID’s videos and another DIDtuber called MultiplicityAndMe and another called DID Hatchery (lmao I’m sure there’s more). 

I had also joined a few OSDD/DID Discord servers (still in one of them on my “system account”) and I had just a few “alters”. Well at first the “alters” started as imaginary friends when I was nine. I had three at first. Two “mind made alters” and one “factive alter”. I also had made a PluralKit (i also think I still have my plural kit??)

Over time I “got” more and more “alters” and sometimes I would even forget their roles and stuff. 

And about the “trauma”. I didn’t have any bad trauma. I had been bullied when I was younger and I was sexually harassed once. But it wasn’t truly that bad. Whenever I would tell people they would say “everyone handles trauma differently!” Or “you’re still valid!” Or even “maybe you’re an Endogenic system?”

I didn’t have DID, and a little part of me always knew that. But everyone always validating me just drowned that out, and I had almost fully believed I had DID.

I started to lose my friends and I was distant from my family. I was always hunched over the computer on Discord. It wasn’t good. I started to look into more disorders like Tourette’s and Dyslexia and Autism. And I started to self diagnose with more and more disorders.

I stumbled upon a website called “Exceptional Individuals” and they had a lot of information about different disorders and they also had tests. According to those tests, I had every single disorder out there. That was a hyperbole, but it still felt like it. 

I was relatively smart as a kid, I was in the gifted program even, and why I thought it was a good idea to fake these disorders? I have no idea. I even faked Dyslexia for a while, but my Mother brought me out of that mentality. At this point, I had come out to my friends as a “DID system,” and they beloved me. I would “switch” in front of them and they didn’t ask a single question. I recently found my diary from around that time, 4th grade, and it was sad.

The servers I was in were not helpful. Every time I would doubt my DID they would tell me “if you’re faking, why would you question it? Fakers know they’re faking.”

Every time they said this it would being doing irreversible damage to the way I think. I can’t go a day anymore without doing something without thinking “oh- that’s a symptom of *insert disorder here*!” Or “omg I think they have *insert disorder here*!” It’s kind of scary what has happened to this generation.

I had also faked Tourette’s. I didn’t do it as long or as severely as I did DID but I still did.

I would randomly tic or say something (sometimes inappropriate) and say it was uncontrollable and I didn’t know what came over me. It was all a lie.

And sometimes I still “tic” to this day. I have a friend with real Tourette’s and I feel bad for doing all of this.

And, back to DID, at one point I had convinced one of my friends into thinking they had it too. I am ashamed of what I did and I’m sorry. I truly am. It has affected my everyday life. I think about it everyday and sometimes it’s a struggle for me to not get back into the habit of faking.

It’s like an addiction. I know the other person who posted about this said the same thing, but it’s true. It’s like an addiction. Sometimes, I do go back into faking. Every once in a while I go back to that website and take the tests again. Sometimes I get active on my “system account.” Sometimes I just feel like I do have these disorders and it hard for me to get back out of that mentality again. And after what I’ve done I feel so so sorry for the people who actually have these disorders. I know there is something wrong with me but it’s not this. 

I had finally ended up realizing that I didn’t have these after about two years of faking. But the damage had already been done. Once again I am sorry. I faked serious mental illnesses and I could have done serious damage to the community. It’s been hard for me to rid the feeling that I still have alters or tics or anything else. It will stick with me for ever.

And to anyone who is faking or feels like they have a disorder, at least do your research. And don’t fake. Talk to your parents or friends or something if you really believe you do have a disorder and see if you showed any signs as a kid. Maybe distance yourself from social media for a week give or take. Don’t just jump to conclusions like I did. It will affect you in the future. You can’t erase what you say in the internet. Always keep that in mind.",1680887223.0,mental_disorder

She comes from a loving middle class family with almost no issues in it. Her parents have a good marriage, dad makes good money, mom stays home with the kids, 3 great siblings, cat she adores, family vacations, cousins she sees frequently and loves etc. She has everything a kid could want. The only thing that one could argue to be detrimental to her is that she’s overweight. She also hit puberty very early and it was very rough on her. Anyway the short version is, she decided to be trans last year though she mostly presents female, she (admittedly) pretended to have DID, she has “uncontrollable tics” from time to time, which only happens every few months (she had admitted to faking tics not long after her episode last April). The tics aren’t consistent and are always different, like she tries new ones out. On Wednesday she started up with the tic thing again and it caused some familial discord (siblings got annoyed, we accused her of faking, she got mad etc.). We saw she had been watching videos of other girls who tic, so we took her phone away indefinitely. One of the things we say to her is that she doesn’t tic at school so we know she can control it. Well, today she went to the nurse and said she couldn’t stop ticcing. The (new) nurse freaked out and asked us if we could pick her up. We told her absolutely not and referred her to the guidance counselor who is familiar with my daughter’s antics. We don’t want her to use tics as a *Get Out of School Free* card. The nurse calls back and says they’re calling my daughter an ambulance because they think she’s hurting herself with her tics (she had red ink on her arm that they thought were scratch marks, and she was slapping heroin the head). My husband had to turn around on his way to work and go to the hospital after the ambulance. She spends the entire day in the crazy kid ward until 10:30 pm only for them to tell us she’s fine and we should contact Child and Family Services for mental help. We’ve been working with CFS for months already, and it’s been no help. She’s in counseling and on Zoloft/Abilify. We have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but that’s not until after Christmas. I just want her diagnosed. I know she doesn’t have a neurological disorder, but sane kids don’t pull this shit. I think she may be bipolar or have a mood disorder. Idk, just ranting here.

Discusses research of DID in teen populations, exploring whether diagnosis is increasing due to awareness or whether due to social contagion. A couple quotes:

>The concern that this new proliferation of social media content about the disorder will create **a rise in clinicians assessing for and possibly misdiagnosing the disorder**, is a real one for many.  
>  
>The suggestion that an individual would purportedly pretend to have multiple self-states and personalities **based on influences other than childhood trauma is a relevant consideration due to the disorder’s newfound popularity on TikTok**.  
>  
>Clinical research and observation has determined that only 5 percent of DID cases present with dramatic switches.

>It discusses evidence that the recent spate of new-onset, severe tics are a form of Mass Psychogenic Illness facilitated by social media networks (**a phenomenon labeled Mass Social Media Induced Illness**). It then suggests that many of those self-diagnosed with DID may be manifesting a similar, **technologically-facilitated conversion phenomenon**. It then explores another explanatory model: that these simulacra of DID and Tourette Syndrome may also arise via a mechanism more closely resembling social media facilitated Factitious Disorder

Update:

Felt the need to respond to a few recurring theme in the comment section:

""Kids will be Kids"" is not, and never will be, a good reason for doing things like this. I do not care if you are 14 or 30, there needs to be consequences for these actions. Being young does not excuse behavior, and bad actions need to be dealt with. An apology is never good enough for repeated and intentional behavior.

Yes I remember being a Kid for the most part. I also remember ""Boys will be boys"". Usually said after I was assaulted, or harassed, or had things stolen. Boys allowed to do horrible things all because ""They just don't know any better."". 

Ya'll are no different than the ""Adults"" in these situations except now it is gender neutral, and everyone gets let off the hook.

""They didn't kill anyone, chill out."" seems to be echoed a few times. They may not have pulled a trigger or stabbed someone, but do you really think that fakers have no blood on their hands? How many suicides do you think are the direct result of these fakers making people who live with these disorders lives harder? 

In a world where the stigma around mental health needs no help, these fakers feel the need to offer it anyways. They spread dangerous misinformation and perceptions which are not just isolated to their echo chambers. Which they do by choice.

Just to be clear, everyone saying I need to ""chill"" has the situation grossly misunderstood. This is about as ""chill"" as I can be given the situation, and honestly I would say I have kept a really cool head in the face of some very ignorant things coming my way.

Due to how this just kind of went nuts, I am going to be putting this baby to sleep on my end.

455,7494.0,faking illness isn't always a sign of mental illness in itself,41,106mmmz,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/106mmmz/faking_illness_isnt_always_a_sign_of_mental/,3,"This whole ""a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they're faking"" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they're doing and still want to feel validated for it. 
Let me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who's probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. 
Of course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. 

See, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. 
But while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. 

It first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don't need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it's easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing ""depressed"" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today's teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren't. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. 

Then we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I'm not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that's as far as my memory goes and I'd appreciate elaboration. 

Now, it's important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it's not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I'm sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as ""damaged"". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. 

Today, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It's actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you're born with it, it's not developed from trauma... 
But anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn't identify as that) you talk to chances are she's gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it's actually so wide spread that it's unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I've tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It's incredibly depressing, and it's a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word 'depressing' just now, it's no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you'd be looked down on it for because you don't have a mental illness that implies that you've went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don't even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that's developed from lots of trauma and it's kind of just assumed that you're living a ""hellish life"".

Now back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they're in. It's just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. 
You're not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that's causing you to be an attention seeker. You're faking because it's simply what everyone around you is doing, it's what's deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it's what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. 
That does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren't the reason they're faking. 
And that's honestly not even those teens' faults. I'm sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it's important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. 

These people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you've been struggling with for years. But here's the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;
Being medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you're going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there's actually very few mental illness that cannot be ""fixed"". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. 
But all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a ""thropy"" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it's not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what's the point in knowing that you're a DID system if you're not going to take the time to become apart of those ""singlet"" people that you love insulting so much? 

Self diagnosis is invalid. Thank you for reading my rant.",1673193627.0,mental_disorder

That said, has anyone else noticed the trend where popular, somewhat quirky, weird or ""outcast"" characters are diagnosed to have some sort of neurodivergency (in particular autism) by the internet? It may seem like innocent fun, but it's actually pretty harmful, as it stereotypes neurodivergent people as being edgy weirdo loners, while also being an incentive for impressionable folks (especially younger individuals) who find a certain character relatable to take a deep dive into the world of self-diagnosing and mental health tiktok/twitter. Behaviours and characteristica that may be present in disordered individuals to a pathological degree, but are also common in neurotypical people (yes, even a neurotypical Nancy can be eccentric or introverted), are seen as stereotypical traits for neurodivergent people, and any popular fictive (and even real) person exhibiting them will automatically be interpreted as ""having a bit of the 'tism"", while they completely ignore that neurodivergent and mentally ill people come in all shapes. Another issue associated with this is the infantillisation of nd people. Perhaps I'm taking it a bit too seriously, but it bothers me so much how obvious stereotypes are being reinforced before my eyes. Representation matters, but not every quirky and non-conforming character is automatically disordered. 

I'm sorry if this topic isn't relevant enough to this subreddit, but there's an enormous overlap between people who self-diagnose and people who behave like that. Both behaviours are partly built on extreme stereotypes, and both reinforce these stereotypes in people's heads.",1669655808.0,mental_disorder

First of all, they all claim to know exactly who their alters are with some depth at about 14-20. This is a major sign that they are faking. Personality states do not become distinct or fully formed until much later in life, if at all. Therapy usually slows down the process of this if the person struggling with it realises they might have something wrong with them and seeks help. Because of the amnesia barriers, they still wouldn’t know who the alters are and wouldn’t be able to communicate with them. So, they wouldn’t know their gender identity or pronouns or mental illness or whatnot. (Note: There can be some level of communication between alters, but that is also really rare because of the amnesia).

Another thing these fakers do is claim each alter has different mental illnesses or conditions. Again, this is a red flag. Although not much research has gone into this disorder because of how incredibly fucking rare it is, the research that has been done shows that a personality state could have a different mental illness than what the “body” has, but not neurological conditions. The brain is incredibly unique, but it has the same structure no matter who’s fronting. Since tourette’s syndrome, for example, is a result of the brain structure being different or “warped”, another alter would still have it. The alter may cause amnesia/memory loss but there is an extremely minuscule chance it would change the brain structure every time they fronted too. I have seen some people posted on this subreddit who also claim different alters can be paralysed from the waist/neck down when other alters don’t.. and wtf? Were they not taught body autonomy? 

This is basic knowledge, but no, you can’t transfer your alters to another system. It’s not pokémon cards. You can’t trade them, you can’t have copies of them, just no. 

Another thing that’s widely debated amongst medical professionals is fictives or irls or whatever these “systems” call them. Fictives do exist, but they are extremely rare and if one were to form, it would be before or around the age of 8 and would’ve taken multiple years, no Arson, not two years, two years isn’t long enough for your dream smp alters to form, it would’ve taken from around 8 years or more to form them. Fictives are formed when the brain latches onto a character that it thinks could protect them from harm and from the trauma that even caused their disorder. 

This brings me onto my last point: endogenic systems. To put it simply; they aren’t real. You can have an imagination without claiming to have a severe lifelong traumatic disorder (minus the trauma in endogenic systems) and no one is going to attack you. DID is formed by multiple years of severe trauma, around or before the age of 8. It’s not your mom yelling at you to do your chores, it’s severe trauma. It’s trauma severe enough that the brain believes the original personality state would only be of harm if they remembered it, so it created other personality states that could take in the trauma. 

One teensy last thing worth noting, you can’t switch alters on command. Alters switch when there is a negative trigger, that is a trauma response. It is kind of like how if someone with PTSD had a trigger of their trauma then they’d have a breakdown, except someone with DID would switch alters really subtly and then switch back when the threat is gone or over. You just can’t have a positive trigger either, because you wouldn’t know what each alter likes unless you were informed by a family member or your therapist. 

Before I post this I wanted to say that every DID system is of course different, and if any GENUINE ones need to fix something i’ve said in the comments I will change my wording. I, myself, do not have DID so i can’t speak on behalf of the community, but this is just what i’ve found through research.

- he also has a past in lying abt stuff (ie, eating disorders, his race, mental health, the list goes on)

i should also add that he is a white American, which i only think is notable because the majority of people I’ve seen who fake DID fit those categories. i don’t hate him, but I hope he finds help. that’s all, i wanted to get it off my chest 🤷🏻‍♀️ lmk if I’m being too harsh or anything",1661706403.0,mental_disorder

I know that these are mainly just kids who don't know better and are searching for answers but I'm

So

Fucking

Frustrated

With the goddamn akinator bullshit I've seen in mental health servers when it comes to DID and 'new alters'. Yes, it is possible that a new part or part emerging from dormancy *might* know how to utilize a bot; that isn't the strange thing as DID is a covert disorder and basic knowledge (such as skills or common information about the world) is often shared between many different parts, especially ANPs. The strange part is how they all know everything except their name. They know everything about how to go to and use a system or mental health discord but not what DID is. They know random bullshit about their 'backstory' (and it is always, always, always fictives, never any of the far more common parts who are far more likely to genuinely be disoriented), their appearance, names of their friends, but never their own name. Suddenly they will be told the name and remember everything and go on to make a full plural kit profile, complete with their particular system's aesthetic.

It's so *frustrating.* The level of misunderstanding of what DID is to cause this entire charade and roleplay (and that is what it is) is unreal. The automatic assumption that all new or re-emerging alters are a fictive is actively dangerous. The over differentiation of alters is dangerous. This play-acting is dangerous and harmful for the kids in question and I'm so fucking *mad* at the societies that have made it a popular trend. If they have DID, they are worsening their disorder, worsening their dissociation, raising barriers and depersonalization, and ruining their own sense of identity. For kids who don't, they are diving deeper into this misdiagnoses and hurting themselves and creating barriers and separations between healthy and normal identity discovery and experimentation. It is normal for teenagers to feel like a bunch of different people as they discover who they are. That's normal! That's part of being a teen! Add in potential trauma and it can become unhealthy, sure, and informed by trauma, but this is a normal developmental phase that is being medicalized. Go kin! Kinning is fine and normal and it is okay to kin characters and feel like them and identify strongly with them! Go role play! Go draw! Go cosplay! Go write! Go get fucking therapy! I'm going to explode!

464,7515.0,Why there are so many people who are endogenic or faking DID/OSDD (speculation),43,12q9uqf,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/12q9uqf/why_there_are_so_many_people_who_are_endogenic_or/,8,"From witnessing one too many instances of endos/""non-disordered systems"" twisting medical words and their meanings, all using outdated resources that casually cite racist ideologies within it, I decided to dive more into the terms they've thrown around when ""proving validity"".

Most of their terms they sprinkle into their arguments are ""multiplicity, plural; non-traumagenic, non-disordered, and no-amnesia"". With the latest 2020s flood of ""systems"", endos took this opportunity to whittle down their self-identified terms to ""multiplicity, plural; no memory of trauma"" to convert impressionable youth into their pro-endo ideology while the DID/OSDD community take the fall.

Why I believe this is due to taking note of these repeated terms. I first find them in these ""sources proving endo validity"" they share in the masses, and then do research into those terms within the context of ""systems"". Their ""plurality"" flows with normal socialized human behavior, meaning they're already trying to blur the line between normal and complex disorder. Unfortunately being successful from how many vulnerable youth they've tricked and the large amount of fakers.

The concept that these people are describing is called ""multiple self-aspects"". Multiple self-aspects is the normal flow of human life everyone has. A ""non-disordered system"" (endos and fakers) would have a constant normal and expected flow between places, relationships, and scenarios (ex: Sarah is a student and timid when at school, Sarah is a lover and flirty to her partner, Sarah is calm and reserved at a restaurant, etc.). A DID/OSDD system would have varied results due to the amnesia and different selves formed from trauma, especially if there's trauma relating to specific places, relationships, and scenarios. Those with other disorders may also have a choppy or lightly unpredictable flow, but that itself doesn't mean they're the same as a DID/OSDD system. I suggest reading a bit of the document below for starters.

My name is Val (not my real name), I’m 15 and I stopped faking DID a year ago. Before you get any further into reading this post, I’d like to set a few rules for commenting:

* Do not send me validation (“This wasn’t your fault” “You were young” etc.). I’ve been debating making this post because I still crave the validation mentioned in my story, but in order to fully close this shitty chapter of my life I feel compelled to share my experience to hopefully stop others from going through what I went through. 
* Do not post self-validation: If you identify as a system, don’t post “Well I’m a real system because x and y”. If you feel the need to validate yourself, you are exactly who this post is meant for. I understand why you want to comment these things but I ask you to set that urge aside for 10 minutes and just read what I have to say
* **I am NOT looking for advice** about **ANY** part of my life that I have shared here. This rule is very much being disrespected and I would appreciate for it to be followed going forward 

This post is long but I just ask you to bear with me. **If you feel that it is too long for you I understand and wish you a good day, but ask you not to downvote it for its size**. With all of that being said, here is how and why I faked DID and what effects it has on my life now. Have a fun read.

—

I discovered DID when I was 12 in 2020 through Anthony Padilla’s DissociaDID video and binged all of their videos while I was depressed during lockdown. I was going through (like a lot of people) an incredibly difficult time of my life, suicidal, isolated, getting back into self-harm after being clean for years. I was introduced to the concept of PTSD through DissociaDID and started “realizing” that I had it (I’ve been diagnosed with nothing and refuse to self-diagnose in any way). Trauma was resurfacing, relatively shallow things like bullying and childhood emotional neglect. I followed ‘systems’ on Instagram and joined Discord to finally be able to talk to people again. The servers were filled with unstable teenagers. It absolutely sucked, we were each other’s therapists, they were constantly telling me how they wanted to kill themselves, telling me about their self-harm, their eating disorders. There were a decent number of suicide scares and alleged attempts.

One day, someone started saying they had DID.

I was constantly disassociating from myself, feeling empty and severely suicidal, I had one attempt. There was one night during the summer when my family and I were staying in a hotel (before anyone mentions it, yes, disrespecting covid guidelines), where it was too warm to sleep and I was in a feverish delusional state. I fully knew what I was doing was wrong. I got a notebook and wrote down the names, ages and genders of my ‘alters’. I think there were initially 12: children, adults, teens, one or two fictional characters. I definitely took a page out of DissociaDID’s alter intros' book. 

I created a new Discord account, joined the server and immediately posted introductions for every one of my ‘alters’. For the next month, I lied about my life and my trauma, I would answer questions about DID that I knew nothing about. I’ve always had a privileged life with a stable household. The only serious abuse that I am aware of now was sexual abuse at the hands of a family member but this wasn’t something I knew back then. But because I knew DID could only be caused by horrid trauma, I just made it up.

I said that my mother was a Christian fanatic, that I got in a car accident. I felt horrible and paranoid about people finding out I was lying but to me this seemed like the only way out.

I started weeding in actual things from my life: self-harm, suicidality, body issues. It stopped being a character I played and over time the fake trauma was erased and replaced by my real, considerably less severe trauma. It was becoming me and eventually, I was completely convinced that I actually had DID. I was addicted and obsessed with Discord, it became my entire life. My social and academic life crumbled, I would be roleplaying as anime characters in class, on the bus, at home, everywhere. I had no hobbies except for Discord, I stopped making art and had no friends or loved ones. 

Then came the system servers. I initially joined a handful and they were absolute cesspools of echo chambers, manufactured drama and horrible people with horrible advice. A completely new world of people saying that they had 70, 100, or over 500 alters was revealed to me, at that point having amassed around 30 alters and using Pluralkit with aesthetic, detailed descriptions for a decent number of my alters.

**THE PEOPLE**

The (confirmed) oldest people I met in those servers were 31, 30 and in their late 20s. All of them had this sense of entitlement about them: They were the oldest, the smartest, they had the last word and everyone listened to them. They were also the most immature and horrid people I had ever met. The 31-year-old constantly cried about how stressful owning a system server was, how they wanted to kill themselves, finding ways to blame it on the teenage members. The 30-year-old, alarmingly and illegally, stalked a 16-year-old member by finding their legal name on their PayPal and contacting their parents, because they had drama online. I remember 20-year-olds having DDLG fetishes. It was a breeding ground for grooming. And I briefly fell victim to it, being pressured into very sexual talk with someone who was older than me, who also groomed other young members into the same trap. 

There were also adults who I considered at the time as being rational: they would falsely correct you on medical aspects of the disorder you convinced yourself you had, always with the same sense of entitlement and superiority, because they were so knowledgeable. 

Everyone else was a teen like me, with something definitely wrong with them, but that thing not being DID. We listened to everything the adults told us. It was kind of sad, I met a lot of people who, if they had not fallen into the same self-diagnosis trap as I had, could have gotten the correct help they needed in real life and would have found actual friends. We were all close, sharing secrets we told each other, shenanigans we did in general chat and movie nights. Our alters multiplied, as did our self-diagnoses. Our alters got more creative, if someone was using crazy pronouns, everyone else had to step up their game and do it as well. Absurdity isn't absurd anymore when everyone is doing it. There were so-called ‘traumalympics’, people dumping trauma on each other in an attempt to one-up, to be the sickest. I remember being pressured into drinking hard liquor in an attempt to show one of my ‘friends’ that they were not alone and that there were others like them who were sick. However, some people were kind and would try to help each other by providing self-harm recovery resources and other helpful things of the sort.

**THE THINGS THEY WERE SAYING**

* “DID requires any kind of trauma” became “DID requires severe trauma”, so we deluded ourselves into thinking our trauma was severe enough to create DID, and the word ‘abuse’ lost all meaning. Drama = abuse, questioning things = abuse, disagreeing = abuse
* Diagnosis was a gold star and a badge of approval, recovery is bad/undesired and one should always be a system. ‘Fusion’ is evil, and being one person is almost equal to murder
* Introjects (to us this term meant fictional characters or famous people) and polyfragmentation (to us this meant systems with a bunch of alters with super intricate and developed personalities) were the most common and normal thing in the world and magically everyone had hundreds of alters overnight
* Everyone else is responsible for handling your triggers and walking on eggshells around you. If they don’t, that’s abuse. I remember some servers having ‘trigger lists’, which were bullet lists of things that were banned from being said in servers, with dozens of entries, ranging from general topics to the word ‘ok’. If you slipped up, you would be shamed 
* Reality checking and ‘fakeclaiming’ is bad. People should let you rot in your delusions, and if they don’t then they are abusers and you should avoid them
* “If you were faking, then you wouldn’t be questioning whether you are faking, because you already know” was the most damaging of them all. The number of people I have seen be on the edge of breaking out of their delusions only to be pulled back into the nightmarish pit of validation by strangers with the same craving and addiction is heartbreaking.
* Self-diagnosis, in every single case, is good. Any symptom is always equal to a disorder that has to be labeled and put into a pretty jar that you show off to everyone who comes across your messages in the alter-introduction channel
* Subreddits (like this one) are evil, hateful places that you should never go to, never look at, never consume and never dare agree with

If you were to disregard any one of these (un)spoken rules, you were called an abuser or fakeclaimer, cast out, bombarded with people convincing you that you are wrong and that your intentions are malicious and you are a hateful person. Any slight misstep could end with you being stabbed in the stomach by adults who you saw as the gods of these digital cults. 

Like so many, in an attempt to garner validation, I would shove myself into however or whatever would hear me out. I would post DID content on Tumblr and Instagram, I would post self-validation on this subreddit or r/SystemsCringe (how the turntables) and would freak out if anyone called out my bullshit. At some point, I had around 300 'alters', was self-identified as a 'polyfragmented introject heavy OSDD-1b system', and would try to convince anyone that I could that this was a very rational thing for me to be.

After a year of faking DID, I left all of these big servers, probably over some drama that meant nothing. I deleted all of my DID-oriented social media (which was an incredible decision) and stayed in small servers of ‘systems’ that were less cult-ish, but were still validation farms for their owners. Unbelievably, away from the echo chambers we were used to, we actually start gaining common sense. It was difficult, but many of us started accepting that we don’t and never have had DID, that we are simply sick in a different way. For some of us, often the ones in therapy, with real friends or support systems, the transition to being a single person again was easier. For others, like me, it was more difficult. It had been a year and a half that I had been faking DID, and my transition began with the deletion of most alters from my Pluralkit, keeping only the ‘active’ ones, until I deleted my Pluralkit entirely, which single-handedly put me on track for getting my life back. I made real friends, stopped saying I was a system on Discord until one day I could say, without fear of being hated and shamed, that I wasn’t.

I felt horrible about what I had done. I knew that it was a moment of desperation, a shared delusion I was unfortunate enough to have been sucked into. But honestly all I could think about was what people with real DID have to go through on a daily basis. No medical textbook I had read, no interview I had watched would ever be able to cover the horrors of their daily lives and I felt ashamed of ever trying to mimic their lives in a vain attempt to get the love I was craving.

And I felt empty.

My alters were so distinct, they all had likes and interests that no longer felt appealing to me. I didn’t know what music I liked, what things I wanted to eat, what I wanted to be called or what clothes I wanted to wear. It used to come so naturally with whatever alter I thought I was any given morning but now that I knew I had always been all of them nothing came to mind. I would look for symptoms in everything. It is a mindset that is difficult to this day to get rid of. There is a lot that I haven't mentioned, but I'm not going to post about this again, maybe I'll write a book some day or something (kidding, I hope not)

I am doing better now, I have friends, my relationship with my parents has significantly improved. I deleted Discord in September of 2022, which was the best decision I have ever made. I am still suffering mentally, but I am 4 months (!) self-harm-free. I am considering coming out as transgender and getting treatment for my mental health.

My social skills are recovering and I am finally learning things about myself. I still think about how easy it used to feel, and I do want to go back sometimes. DID faking was surprisingly similar, to me, to what an addiction feels like, but I have set my mind to never relapse into it.

If you are reading this and you identify as a system, I am not here to dismiss you or your symptoms. All I ask is for you to put down your social media for a week and reflect. Don’t think about symptoms and what they mean, think about who YOU are as a person. 

Who are you without whatever disorder you believe you have?

No matter who you are, you are loved and cherished by someone out there. And if there is no one, there is me. 

I’m ready to move on.

466,7525.0,I blame the increase of disorder fakers on Social Media,252,khswa2,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/khswa2/i_blame_the_increase_of_disorder_fakers_on_social/,11,"Before I start rambling, I want to preface the following by saying I usually don't make statements as to whether or not people are faking disorders/illnesses (unless it's REALLY obvious), especially with autism seeing as it's a spectrum. But in some cases that's where the problem starts, the fact that because it's a spectrum or that the disorder is still not completely understood, it leaves the so called 'aesthetic' parts of the disorder open for serious exploitation, which is made infinitely easier through social media.

It's easier to believe your own lies when you have affirmation from others. And of course, most people are usually sympathetic when it comes to mental illnesses/disorders/disabilities, so there will always be people to validate them (often the fakers themselves). This results in a vicious circle of lies believed to be truth because of the constant affirmation through tik tok/twitter/tumblr comments sections. Then it no longer becomes a lie, it becomes a phase.

Then there are those who will 'play up' certain symptoms for 'validation' until they fully believe it's a disorder. For eg) Getting goosebumps at a certain part of a song, then doing a little happy dance thinking it's a stim. Then get further influenced by researching ADHD/Autism etc, now they're buying fidget toys and thinking their favorite singer/movie/tv show is a hyper-fixation of sorts.

Now, I understand the last part is actually how a lot of people discovered they were on the spectrum but there's a difference between discovering small behaviors over the years that (with proper research) turned out to be autism, and taking a particular behavior and exaggerating it to seem similar to the symptoms after research.These people are easier to spot because they usually tend to mimic the lower part of the spectrum despite being visibly a functional person. Obviously because it's more convincing to make an overt display of the lower spectrum symptoms rather than the more discreet symptoms which doesn't really come across much when they're recording themselves on Tik Tok.

&#x200B;

I'm not really sure how all this will come across, but I needed to put feelings on the influx of DID systems, Tourette's, Autism, ADHD/OCD etc videos into words. I know some might say it's because they're trying to normalize or to educate people on disorders, but that excuse is hard to believe when:

1. They all have a particular look to them (art girls, colored hair, white, teens-mid 20s)
2. All of it is the positive/aesthetic/cute/child like aspects of the disorder and NOTHING else(I mean, in terms of autism, for something that's called a SPECTRUM, these girls all act the same)
3. Most of them are self-diagnosed.

All of this being said, I do appreciate those who do genuinely try to educate people on ALL aspects of mental illness and not just the parts that 'look good'. I'm probably saying what everyone has already said but I really had to put it in words for myself. It is annoying knowing that these people will eventually grow out of this phase while the damage to the credibility of mental illness has already been done to those who can't call it a phase. It puts everyone in a difficult situation especially now that people are trying to justify self-diagnosis. In VERY FEW cases, I can understand where it's necessary but I still disagree that it's a valid method.If you disagree or agree, please let me know your side. I'm always eager to see from other perspectives.",1608592973.0,mental_disorder

Back when this stuff first started, the trend was depression and anxiety. People accepted these diagnoses as sufficient explanations for their suffering as they were still viewed as incredibly serious conditions.

However, they were continually “watered down” as more people jumped on the trend and claimed depression and anxiety. The accounts you started to see online equated Normal Human Emotions to the level of clinical depression or anxiety. Nowadays, most people (especially teens) don’t seem to view the disorders as genuinely debilitating conditions. If the influencers with depression can get out of bed, function exceptionally well, and keep up with obligations, why can’t you when you have the same diagnoses as them? 

Clearly what you have is much more severe than what they have. So it can’t just be regular old depression. It has to be something **worse**.



You can see this pattern playing out in real time with the whole ADHD and autism thing. Initially, ADHD was the trend. People who were INCREDIBLY successful and functional were getting diagnosed and became the loudest voices in the community. So if you **can’t** do those things, it must be something worse. So everyone started to say it was “severe” ADHD. Or that they had ADHD-C. But after those terms were co-opted by fakers or those with more mild presentations, they too were viewed as not “bad enough” to explain the issue someone was having.


So it must be comorbid autism and ADHD. And the cycle continues.",1674404078.0,mental_disorder

You are doing more harm than good to the group of people you are “assigning” yourself to.

Because so many of you are creating these god-awful stereotypes, you are causing those of us with genuine medical diagnoses to not want to share anything out of fear of being grouped in with the stereotypes found on TikTok/YouTube and other social platforms. This makes it difficult to open up and find the support needed or wanted whether it be professional or just from those around us (friends/family/co-workers etc).

**I, a stranger on the internet, do not want to dismiss your thoughts. If you have a genuine belief that you may have a difficulty, disorder or disability then please just seek advice to look into more official means of figuring it out.**

Just because you do something someone with ASD does or just because you believe you have similarities to any other of these developmental/learning/mental disabilities/disorders or difficulties ** DOES NOT ** mean you have the right to ‘self diagnose’. There are reasons that there are professionals to diagnose. 

I can guarantee that you are not special for it, you are not different and you are not “creating awareness”. A very large amount of the entire population will have a trait(s) or behaviour(s) that can be associated with one of them but it does not mean that everyone on earth is Autistic or has OCD or DID or whatever else is “trendy” to you.

Having one of these disabilities/disorders/ difficulties is not something you pick and choose depending on the latest TikTok trend. It takes time and a whole lot of evaluation. 

Some are lucky and have professionals (like doctors/teachers/nurses) around them who notice it in them from a young age, some aren’t and don’t get a diagnosis until they’re older and can either take it upon themselves to seek advice or are recommended to do so by someone who knows what they’re talking about.

Just because you’ve gone onto Reddit/Google/TikTok or wherever else and found a list of traits/behaviours and symptoms, does not mean that you can then start fitting them into your daily life just so you can self-diagnose to be “different”.

You are making a mockery of these communities. Grow up and stop thinking that you’re doing something helpful or original. You are creating a hurtful image. 

If you’d actually done proper research, maybe you’d know that not everyone with ASD wants to suck on dummies, wear headphones while holding 5 plushies, start shaking their arms while wearing children’s clothes and claim that they are now no longer afraid to show off their “free stimming” magically all at once, especially just for a video. 
The same goes with those clips of someone ‘stimming’ while listening to a snippet of music that you want to claim “affects people with autism”, not every person with ASD has sensory issues, not every person with ASD has the exact same traits, behaviours and patterns.

It is not a case that you go down a checklist and if you get them all then “oh wow you must have autism!!”. There is so much depth and analysis to it and you need to stop.",1664037024.0,mental_disorder

I am happy to hear other opinions but people please be kind! Also I apologies if this breaks any rules. 

A little about me I'm 15 and have had past deals with fakers though not been a faker myself. 

So this is mainly going to focus on DID and mental health discord server through out the pandemic. 

This post is linked to yesterdays interesting former faker post which mentioned the online communities of fakers particularly discord servers. We can all agree some these servers were bad (because they were toxic) and the ring leaders of these servers (not necessarily the creators of the servers) created drama as well as in my opinion manipulated young impressionable minds into believing they had disorders such as DID by linking there mental health struggles with symptoms and diagnostic criteria for certain disorders and toxically validating there concerns about having DID by convincing them they had it. 

The isolation many of us experienced during the pandemic lead to too much time spent online and being on these servers meant being surround by DID content all the time (anyone on discord mental health servers during the pandemic saw plural kit all the time lets be honest). Being surrounded by DID content all the time lead to younger people such as preteens feeling isolated and left out leading to them wanting to join in with being DID. Also at that time in your life many of us were going through a lot of changes mentally discovering who we are in a world changing all around us. When going through these changes it can seem like we are changing into a different person as we become a mix of our teenage self and child self which can seem like our personality is splitting. 

This sense of changing as a person and maybe not feeling yourself is sometimes linked to DID. Most children also have some childhood trauma (mostly minor) but it may not be processed properly giving more reason to believe they may have DID. Going on mental health discord server daily when being impressionable but also going through a lot of changes that cause 'symptoms' that could be manipulated to be interpreted to be symptoms of DID. Looking at it from this perspective it is easy for young people to become convinced they truly do have DID. The validation from discord servers as soon as someone thought they had DID was overwhelming becoming almost like a cult from what I saw of it, as soon as someone mentioned maybe having DID they were validated and more or less shamed if they doubted themselves after that. 

Once the person said they thought they had DID there was no backing out of it unless you made a completely new account or left the server. Some then played along and tried to convince themselves they had DID even if deep down they knew they didn't due to feeling like they would not fit in and invalid if they did not have DID. There was a lot of dislike in some communities (more like cults I would say) about not having DID and being a singlet is like treason and anyone who was a singlet or doubted having DID was convinced they did have DID. Those who knew they truly didn't have DID were validated making it hard to stop faking. 

This validation can become very addictive as former fakers on this subreddit have mentioned and for young people (especially tweens and teens) validation is very important and to feel validated even when doing something that is wrong is addictive. Also feeling apart of something is important for young people and due to the pandemic discord servers became some young peoples friends and being validated in these servers was important for them giving them more motive to continue faking. 

Over time many grew up and realised they were wrong and needed to stop but some DID became part of their personality. Who were they without DID? Many on these servers only talked about DID and their alters we never truly knew them which is sad and many of them must have felt so alone knowing all their friends didn't truly know they just a fake fantasy version of themselves. Making quitting so much harder as it means leaving a part of their lives behind and starting a fresh. 

What I am saying is that this faking of disorders in young people isn't all their fault but a mass case of munchausen by proxy. I remember being on many mental health servers when I was 12-14 during the pandemic and remember seeing these cults or DID validator and toxicity in the community convincing people they did have DID and shaming singlets. This didn't only happen with DID but with lots of illnesses and the validation and encouragement of illnesses became toxic for those who where suffering from said illness but also them who were not. And the glamourising of illness made it trendy which made the environment even more toxic with people who truly had the illness in question were being called fakers for not accepting the glamorisation of illness and people who were no ill wanting to be ill. Many with mental health conditions were also encouraged not to get treatment which could have helped them or made them realise there weren't truly ill.

Sorry for the bad formatting and any spelling mistakes this is just my view on DID that it wasn't all the faker fault but more the ring leaders manipulating kids. The fakers are wrong but that doesn't mean they are bad people and that they meant to cause harm. It is important for us to realise that they were victims too and it is important we don't just shame them but also help them to realise they are wrong and break the addictive cycle of validation.

470,7542.0,does anyone remember the uptick of 'tourettes' cases during the pandemic? (slight rant),9,13m8fhy,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/13m8fhy/does_anyone_remember_the_uptick_of_tourettes/,0,"not sure if anyone else heard about this at all, but i honestly am pretty fascinated by it.

slight bit of context, im gonna try not to make this a storytime cause im really interested in hearing what others think of this but around the pandemic i personally got (mis)diagnosed with Tourette's which was later rediagnosed to Functional Tics. my neurologist brought up that she and other doctors had seen a uptick in sudden onset tourette's like symptoms in later teens (as far as im aware thats not how tourette's presents)

and honestly i've been kind of fascinated by this phenomenon. i was one of those cases but for me personally the tourette's was a misdiagnosis. the really interesting thing is that i can remember her specifically citing how patients reported their tics getting worse if they consumed tourette's related content on tiktok (like tics.and.roses). and the fact that treatment is often just.... limiting social media usage lmao

its very possible that the phenomenon is some sort of rise in functional disorders (if you guys dont know what functional disorders are, they're physical symptoms caused by mental stress, like dissociative seizures or conversion disorder). but i think people who fake this stuff or at least copy the fakers online... dont realize this has serious consequences and that *people are aware of it*

471,7544.0,Life before the internet.,181,merh2z,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/merh2z/life_before_the_internet/,23,"A question that seems to come up here a lot is “Why is this fakery becoming so common?” and I thought I’d give a little perspective for those who can’t remember a time before the internet existed. Which is (according to Reddit’s demographics) about 90% of Reddit users. 

And my God does Reddit play a large role in this foolishness. 

Thing is, we **did** have fakers in the 80s. It wasn’t even that rare either. You had kids at school who would pretend to be dyslexic because it sounded cool, you had kids who would fake having asthma for attention. You also had kids who would exaggerate some genuine minor ailment so that they’d be known as “that kid who has ___” - whatever the condition was. In all cases it seemed to involve someone with no self-esteem and very poor social skills. 

It’s no different, in one sense from the “stolen valour” guys, or the people who pretend their dad is a cop. Or that their grandfather was a decorated war hero (that was a very common one in the 80s as most of our grandfathers had served in the War). 

Where things really exploded was with the invention of social media. Now, not only could you find an instant audience of morons gullible enough to believe you, but an entire audience of other boring, unfulfilled, dishonest people who enjoyed impersonating illnesses. Whereas in the 80s people would simply have told you to “Grow the fuck up” you now have an online world of bad actors who know they can do whatever the hell they want and get attention for it. 

What also helped the market in “I have a special condition” impersonators was the American pharmaceutical industry. What were formerly behaviours labelled “Unruly conduct” or “attention-seeking behaviour” or just plain laziness were (from the late-80s onward) increasingly pathologised until typical adolescent issues were suddenly turned into a world of abnormal psychological disorders that pharma companies could make *an absolute fortune out of*. America, by a LONG stretch, leads the world in dishing out anti-depressants and “stabilisers” to children. 

Above all, social media has created a generation of misfits who think victimhood is cool. It’s now cool to be the victim of history, the victim of your family, your school, your society, your sex, your age group, and on and on and on and on. Boy do we love a victim! 

So when you combine it all you have a perfect recipe for what we have today- impersonating illness. Nobody around to call you out in person, an entire industry telling us mental disorders are “the new norm”, a generation of people who think discussing your problems in front of total strangers is normal, and entire online communities of other Cosplay actors who share your hobby of inventing conditions and disorders. 

The icing on the social media cake is this: if anyone points out you’re fabricating an illness you can always call them a cyber bully. 

But here’s the single most disturbing factor for an old fart who grew up in the 80s: this kind of fraudulent, childish, immoral medical fakery was (prior to the internet) almost entirely the domain of children. 99 times out of 100 it was a child pulling this stunt. Today? I’d say sixty or even seventy percent of those doing this online are adults. I find that truly disturbing.",1616894514.0,mental_disorder

I saw Adults and teens older than me talking about this mental illness and how anyone could have it just because they own a fidget toy. I was convinced that I have adhd. Me getting distracted easily, getting tired or suddenly very energetic was because of my adhd, getting bad marks was because of my adhd, literally everything I did was because of adhd. 
Cuz it all made sense, it gave me an advantage, I could now blame something other than me for all the bad habits I had, and not even be the bad guy for it. 
I convinced my mother to take me to a doctor for diagnosis, and I did get diagnosed with adhd but also other mental illnesses that was caused by external factors, but obviously I only paid attention to my adhd. I did not care about getting better. I did not care about my mental health. No I only cared about the attention I got and being able to do anything without consequences. 
But then TikTok got banned in my country, I lost my main supporters, I started feeling lonely and unvalid.
My mother had had enough, she had a big conversation with me and it made me realise how toxic my life had been the previous year, but I still kept blaming everything on my adhd only now I was trying to get better. But no matter how hard I tried it was only getting worse. my health was deteriorating and I was getting worse and worse marks in my exams.
6 months ago my parents took me to get a blood test done and turns out I actually have a life threatening auto immune disorder and had I not gone to the doctors then the illness could have very well gotten to the point of no return which could have even lead to death.the symptoms of this illness are very similar to the symptoms of adhd. These tiktokers made me so convinced that I have adhd that I didn’t even try to find other reasons for my health conditions.

I truly hate these people for ruining almost 4 years of my life. I lost my chance at getting merit in my 10th grade which I know I could have gotten if I  had not been basically manipulated into not getting any help and thinking that my problems will never get solved and my bad habits will never go away since I have adhd and that I just have to accept it and that it will all work out once I do. 
I have wasted my parents money, made my mother feel bad and guilty every time I shouted at her for no reason and justifying it with me having adhd. I lost the time I could have spent with my sister instead of calling her the worst sister ever just because she tried to find other reasons to my problems other than adhd. 

Sorry if this felt like I was trauma dumping but truly these people on TikTok especially the adults need to understand how terribly misleading and dangerous their posts can be to  kids and even naive adults.",1660294206.0,mental_disorder
473,7550.0,“age fluidity” is a serious consequence of normalizing/validating DID “systems”,379,xjfqgv,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/xjfqgv/age_fluidity_is_a_serious_consequence_of/,18,"That’s just sort of a term i made up because i don’t really know how else to refer to it. as someone who’s grown up online and been exposed to all the wrong parts of the internet and super harmful ideologies/trends i noticed that people (especially kids) are getting more bold with claiming that they are legitimately a different age from the “body” and its so scary and harmful for so many reasons. 

it really gives the vibe of “i’m mature for my age” and when you’re younger than 16 (or shit even younger than 18, although my biggest concern is the younger fakers) that attitude is such a dangerous one to have especially if you have free reign in all online spaces (especially echo chambers like discord and tiktok)

it’s really scary to live in a time where adults who claim to legitimately be a minor/a child or children who claim to be adults are validated on the basis of having “alters” (which are ALWAYS fake)

also just a reminder i guess to minors and kids who do feel “mature” for their age— maybe you are, and maybe it’s partly because you experienced a real trauma and have had to grow up fast. that’s okay, but that also doesn’t make you actually an adult on the inside. please just try to enjoy your childhood while it lasts, and stay away from adults who brag about having severe mental illness online. those people are not role models that you should look up to or interact with .

474,7553.0,Past Faker Here—Sort Of…,56,wm77gu,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/wm77gu/past_faker_heresort_of/,3,"Seen a handful of threads on here from past fakers, and figured now that discussions are a thing here I'd bring up my experiences for insight as well.

To begin, I was 13 at the time of this happening. It's been almost a decade since then, and I've completely stopped the faking and reflect with lots of cringe and annoyance at my past self.

Now, to dive into the specifics.

The year is 2013. The year prior I had discovered internet horror—and cringiest of all—creepypastas. I instantly fell in love, and had to make my own character. She was a nightmare; and I mean that as the most Mary Sue to ever Mary Sue, loved by all, accidentally a trans woman (I didn't understand how twins worked until my mid-to-late teens despite having identical twins in my family) and worst of all—*mentally ill*.

I can't remember her entire disorder smoothie. But there was a lot. One, specifically, was DID. Or, well, as I knew it at the time after my five-minute google sesh; ""MPD"". In all actuality, it was this weird elaborate backstory thing where it wasn't actually a Dissociative Disorder, but two of her past lives stuck in her body that just presented like a mental illness. She was supposed to have this entire character arc where they all merged together and she would essentially become like, a God, or something.

Now, you might go; ""But wait, u/nootingimportant, having an OC doesn't mean you faked a mental illness!"" and you would be correct. However, I was a cringy 13 year old who did text rp and would get so into character that I would wind up LARPing (Live-Action Roleplaying, that is) with my friend at school who did these roleplays with me. I would get so into character that I'd genuinely believe I was hearing voices. I had myself genuinely convinced that I was not only the character I had made, but *also* that all those fictional creepypasta characters were real and were my friends.

I definitely struggled a lot in my younger years, and I think being bullied from ages 7–12 really cemented the idea of finding a sense of self in a false reality. It didn't help that my friend and I only enabled the behaviour, but thankfully we grew out of it by ages 15/16. We're still close friends to this day, and absolutely cringe at the mention of our OCs.

I'd love to hear secondary thoughts on this. It really does seem like some of the people who fake things like this, such as myself at one point, just wanted a reason to fit in and feel important in some way. It's just sad that the avenues taken leave bad impressions on people who genuinely have these issues and perpetuate more stereotypes and invalidity for them.",1660264940.0,mental_disorder
475,7554.0,About Eizawolfe and Stigma,284,jlf328,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/jlf328/about_eizawolfe_and_stigma/,44,"If you're here on this subreddit from her recent TikTok, I want you to hear me out. Before anything else, I want to make perfectly clear I do not wish any harm on this young lady and I do not know whether or not she actually has autism. No one in this subreddit knows for certain because none of us have properly assessed her in the ways only a doctor can. I will say, however, that the information she has given to the public does not make sense and has therefore caused suspicion that she is not telling the truth. I will be talking about why this suspicion came about, but before getting into that, I want to talk about why what she is doing is harmful not only to her but also to other people regardless of whether or not she actually has autism.

The majority of the people on this subreddit have been diagnosed with disorders, disabilities, and/or mental illnesses. We have experienced first-hand the consequences of other people self-diagnosing and seeking attention. There are people who have been bullied, assaulted, refused treatment, refused medication, and yes, there are people who have died because of this problem. What self-diagnosers and attention-seekers do is add to the stigma associated with disorders and mental illness. Some of you might be thinking I'm blowing this way out of proportion, but those of you who have been properly diagnosed will understand I am not, and I'd greatly appreciate you telling your story in the comments and/or providing references you may have to further educate these people who do not understand. 

Here's one reference on combatting the stigma of mental illness: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477

Notice how receiving treatment is one of the ways to combat the stigma. However, you cannot receive treatment if you have not been diagnosed by someone that's QUALIFIED to make a diagnosis. YOU are not qualified to diagnose yourself. Even if you were a doctor, you could not diagnose yourself. Even if you have a family member who is a doctor, they cannot diagnose you. This is because of ethics, which are purposefully put in place to protect patients. 

There is a reason why doctors have to go through such rigorous schooling. There is a reason why they need to be updated on research. There is a reason why many of them conduct research themselves. This is so they can learn to properly DIAGNOSE and TREAT patients. 

Are there bad doctors out there? Yep. Can doctors make mistakes? Yep. Can doctors be unsure of what to do? Yep. Does one type of doctor not know everything? Yep. 

This is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.

(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you'd think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it's not.)

Now that I'm done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I'm going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you're reading this, perhaps you'd be willing to clear a few things up. 

(I'm going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)

1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm not saying you can't look up your symptoms and go, ""Hey maybe I've got this!"" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, ""But my therapist thinks I'm autistic and other doctors too!"" Doesn't matter, they're apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That's why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. 

2. It's entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn't real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn't have. What doesn't make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. 

3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver's test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. 

4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you're paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn't make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I'm likely to get bombarded with, ""but her health insurance doesn't cover anyone else!!!!"" Definitely possible, but it'd be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that's willing to diagnose you for that much money. 

5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you're sitting in front of what you said was ""some random woman sleeping behind you."" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there's a whole lot of you going outside so... ???

I can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I'll save you some time. Yes, it's possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn't talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn't make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that'd clear things up. It's public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. 

Note: Don't go harass her on Instagram. 

A lot of things to make this long post even longer: 
Eizawolfe, you took people's money for a diagnosis, I hope that's actually what you're using it for. I also hope you squash everyone's suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you're autistic, it's not right to be speaking like you're a part of a mistreated group of people when you don't truly know if you're a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we're all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can't speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren't lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol 

If anyone's wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I've been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. 

And if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it's 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don't be shy. :')

I understand claiming to have DID and other disorders is a trend for young people, but I also wonder whether there is a language gap and an inability to describe internal experiences that come from growing up extremely online. 

Anyone born from 2000 on has a drastically different and new experience of themselves and their social environment than people have ever had due to having lifelong access to the internet. This seems to be true especially for people who have been extremely online since childhood. Is it possible so many young people are identifying with and relating to DID because they actually have been able to cultivate and sustain multiple identities online their entire life? If someone has been super into online role playing basically since they had a self-concept, it seems normal to feel as if they embody multiple identities that can quickly fluctuate (like switching from one app to another). 

Obviously the desire to be recognized as having mental illness plays into it, but maybe there’s actually a gap in the language we have to conceptualize human experiences in an extremely online world.

i have this ""friend"" of mine who is claiming to have a bunch of disorders (tics, ADHD, depression, anxiety and anorexia) and i wanna go over all of them a bit. they really do go to a therapist btw and apparently do have an ADHD diagnosis its still a bit sus tho  
just before i start, they say theyre nonbinary but use all pronouns, so dont bash me if i say she throughout this post, im a trans guy myself :)  
i am btw currently 14 and visit a high school ig (school where i come from is weird) but this all started in like middle school. 2021 after the huge covid break where it was homeschooling  
 they came up to me one day in school and started telling me how annoying their therapist is and that she just wants to get her depression diagnosis. this isnt how therapy works? ig? idk i didnt go to therapy yet but you dont go there and be like ""diagnose me with depression"" or smth like that. i just took it like that bc at the time, i was just trying to survive and stay closeted i was really afraid due to anxiety issues but thats not the topic. but her depression came out of nowhere with no apparent trigger? and they didnt really show any symptoms and the only thing they really did was c\*t themselves and making jokingly plans about s\*!cide (i say theyre jokes bc she was \*always\*  laughing when this was happening and took it really lightly, which was and still is pretty triggering for me and makes me really uncomfortable) and they never actually got diagnosed with it.  


next i wanna go over their anxiety and panic attacks and shit. i suffer from panic attacks etc too and i know it looks different for every person, but they litereallly used it as an excuse. im gonna take for example one story from last year, im just gonna call them ""S"": it was just a regular morning and we had class with a teacher we both dont like for reasons that i dont want to talk abt. so S just went up to that teacher, stating that they have a panic attack and need to go outside with me to calm down, which my teacher would do bc she is understanding with stuff like this. so me and S went outside so they could ""calm down"" and it was so annoying. she was just walking around me in a circle which made me really uncomfortable bc i felt trapped, which i tried to say but they didnt stop. and they were all chit chatty and laughy and it didnt feel at all like they were doing bad, until the teacher came outside to check on them. then ofc evetrhing was abd again and they could in no way go inside nonono. they did that again when the teacher came back again but then even she had enough of that bs and made us go inside. so yea they def be faking that/overdramatizing that one  
their anorexia might have legit  symptoms alltough they kinda just dropped that one at one point and eat completely normal again now

now my ""favourite"" thing that S was faking (this is sorta a 2 in one but with the ADHD i am not sure theyre faking, it might be legit. their experiences/symptoms are just different then mine i suppose.)  
anyway, buckle up for this amazing/s story  
this also happened 2021 when we came back to school, all of this did, she probably just spent too much time on tt during quarantine lmao.  
anyway, at some point completely randomly S started claiming they have tics. at first it was nothing severe, just some head jolts or maybe a hand movement, nothing severe, nothing ""special"". my best friend and my boyfriend both have a tic disorder so i didnt mind and i was used to it. at first S claimed it was tourettes, which would be like the most plausible thing to say when you claim to have tics i suppose (not saying that this is justified, im just trying to think with her mind or smth). after a while this all started to get more severe, vocal tics started to accur on a regullar basis up until a point where i could have ""conversations"" with their tics. the ""best"" part of this tho that suddenly their tics werent tourettes anymore, it was their ADHD. I am not sure that they are faking it, and apparently she did get a diagnosis for it but the tics they had were too severe to be from their ADHD. it can in rare cases cause minor tics, but not tics of this severety. they were also only ticcing when it was convient for them and suddenly all out of nowhere when they got medication for adhd, not a single tic ever to be seen again.

i am very sorry for this rant, i know this is supposed to be a memey cringey subreddit, but this has been on my mind for a while and i felt like putting this here since i am in a very bad mental place and this is still sorta going on and also some other shit with S is going on that doesnt belong here tho.

if anything i say is actually legit to the disorders and i am saying bs, feel free to call me out in the comments, im a teenager, not a mental health proffesional :)",1662216168.0,mental_disorder

Ask questions. Why do I have the massive need to pretend to be someone i am not? What does it give me? Easy awnsers would be: Sympathy, attention, a way to build a personality/online persona and a way to ""never grow up and have adult responsibilities.

 I know that teenage years are can be a pain in the ass and its hard to find a place to really belong. Mood, body, and personality changes are part of it. Finding an easy and comfortable solution might seem appealing but slapping a label on it and calling it ""adhd"" or ""a personality disorder"" can really bite you in the ass. 
Looking for a job in the future? If your boss sees cancerous shit like ""pro paraphilia"" or illnesses like ""bpd"", ""did"", ""tourettes"" they will probably choose somebody else with a more ""normal"" social media apperance. I worked in HR, we really check the profiles of applicants, at least in this company. Think about your future when you dont care about minecraft alters, neopronouns and the ""autism creature"" anymore.


Try to figure out what faking gives you, and find a healthy substitute. Quit bullshitting you and the people around you. Mental illness might be ""edgy and cute"" when you can play with your fidget toys and do your dumb stim dances, but it isnt that cute when you think that the CIA sends agents to your house molest you at night, or when you hang from the ceiling because you think its the only option. Its an illness, not something you put off like makeup at the end of the day. It destroys lives and families. 

Faking wont give you happiness. Try to solve issues you are facing instead of giving them a ""diagnosis"". If you feel like something really is wrong, talk to an adult you trust. Not you quirky discord enablers.

Feeling sad and angry or confused about who you really are is part of the human condition at the end of the day.",1675516561.0,mental_disorder

This cousin (who i will refer to as R) was about to turn 12 and they were about to start high school when the summer break ended (they were a year younger then their year level and australian high school starts in the year they turn 13 or 12). R is a tiktok cosplayer with a decent following of 2k so they created a discord server for there followers. I had known R for a long time, as they were very close with their cousin/my friend S and I have known S since 1st grade.

In this server, I discovered that they were dating someone named T, who was about 14, turning 15 in September, according to the partner finding channel. T was polyamorous and reportedly had 13-16 partners. They set their age range to 11/12 to 15 which was really quite iffy.

T also claimed to have DID, having alters such as Sayori from Doki Doki Literature Club, an Editor Wilbur Soot, a revivebur, some character named Yuri with they/knife pronouns and around 70 other alters. It seemed like R's server was a hotspot for fakers, with many of the 200 members claimed to have it. These fakers had made this server a hostile environment, with people getting upset over the littlest things like a silly gif telling them to use the right your/you're.

I have grown up in a household with a severely mentally disabled older brother who cant speak, read, write or even use the bathroom, so I have spent a lot of time around other families who also have severely disabled children who are friends with my mother. So generally, people who fake any sort of disorder piss me off, because actual people are truly suffering from disability and these kids are turning it into an aesthetic when i watch my older brother every day unable to say how he feels.

Back to the grooming faker, they ""dated"" my friends cousin for SEVEN MONTHS before my friends and I intervened. Not to mention, they were dating others as well who were very young too, as they were dating two of the friends i made in that server, N (11 at the time) and H (13 at the time). At one point, R finally exposed them, after T had left the server due to my friends and I trolling with R's approval and that we had owner status and R and T  promptly ended the relationship afterwards, on tiktok. someone in the tiktok comments revealed that they went to the same primary school and T had GROOMED GIRLS IN THE SCHOOL BATHROOMS when they were in 6th grade. As well as that, according to H, T would be extremely manipulative during the time they dated and would repeatedly love-bomb them after they would argue. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this weird slightly vague rant about the POS who dated my friends cousin.

EDIT: y'all i barely talk to this friend's cousin on discord as they barely use it and the server she created was deleted by my friends and i after she herself left it. plus, R looks a lot older than the average 12 year old as shes 5'7ish. i have no control of what they do on the internet as i rarely see them.",1662516936.0,mental_disorder
481,7606.0,A theory,380,13zbbrw,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/13zbbrw/a_theory/,56,"I really think that the sudden trendiness of disorders and neurodivergence in general can be attributed to two factors:

1) The obvious low hanging fruit: Attention. In a lot of ways my heart goes out to the teens and young people of today. They live in an online world that is so different than what I experienced even 10 years ago in high school. For a lot of Gen Z, to be observed is to exist. I think back to my teens and I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that I didn’t necessarily feel ‘seen’, having something like tik tok that potentially supplies thousands of eyes and a seemingly infinite train of validation would have been incredibly appealing. The problem is how do you stand out in an ocean of content? You get more and more extreme. Teens are already incredibly talented at creating and locating sub-cultures and in-groups. Neurodivergent-tok is the ultimate ‘safe space’ where EVERYTHING is automatically valid and no behavior is condemned. What results is a bunch of lonely and/or awkward teens ‘yes and-ing’ eachother online until things get to the point where they’re ridiculous and offensive. 

2) Infantilization. The world is a really really scary place right now, and seems to be getting worse by the day. Gen Z is probably the most socially conscious and aware generation in history. They for the most part are incredibly aware that they are inheriting a world that is dark and incredibly complex. Fascism, bigotry, the climate, job prospects, economic disparity… there’s very little silver lining and I think there’s a growing amount of despair and resentment amongst all young people that we’re going to have to clean up messes we didn’t make and the stakes for doing so are incredibly high. That’s a lot of pressure. In a lot of ways I see the Faker movement as a rejection and revolt against that responsibility. It’s people standing on the precipice of adulthood and saying ‘no thanks’. In the mind of an adolescent, ill people are taken care of and have very little responsibilities beyond their own personal recovery and journey. The journey itself is romanticized, it’s no wonder why disorders like DiD are so ‘popular’. It’s an embrace of the imaginary and the creation of a curated alternate world with hard and fast roles and rules that give teens permission to drop out of life and play pretend in a manner that not only is age appropriate but also invites pity and a broadcasts a need to be nurtured. I think it’s really telling that Fakers aesthetically seem drawn to childhood: plushes, cosplay, cartoons, bright colors. In fact, most of the behaviors exhibited seem to be thinly veiled age-play instead of actual re-creation of any real world symptoms. Faking gives permission to say no to adulthood and I think it’s no mistake that it’s become increasingly prevalent in a generation where adulthood is incredibly frightening. 

I wish that they had support systems in place to tell them that they don’t need a disorder to be valid, seen, and special. My empathy has limits though, they may not realize it, but this content is doing real harm and their ticket out of reality and the responsibilities of the grown up world is being paid for in the blood of those who actually need support.",1685795193.0,despair
482,7608.0,About Eizawolfe and Stigma,281,jlf328,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/jlf328/about_eizawolfe_and_stigma/,44,"If you're here on this subreddit from her recent TikTok, I want you to hear me out. Before anything else, I want to make perfectly clear I do not wish any harm on this young lady and I do not know whether or not she actually has autism. No one in this subreddit knows for certain because none of us have properly assessed her in the ways only a doctor can. I will say, however, that the information she has given to the public does not make sense and has therefore caused suspicion that she is not telling the truth. I will be talking about why this suspicion came about, but before getting into that, I want to talk about why what she is doing is harmful not only to her but also to other people regardless of whether or not she actually has autism.

The majority of the people on this subreddit have been diagnosed with disorders, disabilities, and/or mental illnesses. We have experienced first-hand the consequences of other people self-diagnosing and seeking attention. There are people who have been bullied, assaulted, refused treatment, refused medication, and yes, there are people who have died because of this problem. What self-diagnosers and attention-seekers do is add to the stigma associated with disorders and mental illness. Some of you might be thinking I'm blowing this way out of proportion, but those of you who have been properly diagnosed will understand I am not, and I'd greatly appreciate you telling your story in the comments and/or providing references you may have to further educate these people who do not understand. 

Here's one reference on combatting the stigma of mental illness: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477

Notice how receiving treatment is one of the ways to combat the stigma. However, you cannot receive treatment if you have not been diagnosed by someone that's QUALIFIED to make a diagnosis. YOU are not qualified to diagnose yourself. Even if you were a doctor, you could not diagnose yourself. Even if you have a family member who is a doctor, they cannot diagnose you. This is because of ethics, which are purposefully put in place to protect patients. 

There is a reason why doctors have to go through such rigorous schooling. There is a reason why they need to be updated on research. There is a reason why many of them conduct research themselves. This is so they can learn to properly DIAGNOSE and TREAT patients. 

Are there bad doctors out there? Yep. Can doctors make mistakes? Yep. Can doctors be unsure of what to do? Yep. Does one type of doctor not know everything? Yep. 

This is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.

(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you'd think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it's not.)

Now that I'm done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I'm going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you're reading this, perhaps you'd be willing to clear a few things up. 

(I'm going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)

1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm not saying you can't look up your symptoms and go, ""Hey maybe I've got this!"" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, ""But my therapist thinks I'm autistic and other doctors too!"" Doesn't matter, they're apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That's why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. 

2. It's entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn't real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn't have. What doesn't make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. 

3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver's test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. 

4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you're paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn't make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I'm likely to get bombarded with, ""but her health insurance doesn't cover anyone else!!!!"" Definitely possible, but it'd be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that's willing to diagnose you for that much money. 

5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you're sitting in front of what you said was ""some random woman sleeping behind you."" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there's a whole lot of you going outside so... ???

I can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I'll save you some time. Yes, it's possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn't talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn't make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that'd clear things up. It's public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. 

Note: Don't go harass her on Instagram. 

A lot of things to make this long post even longer: 
Eizawolfe, you took people's money for a diagnosis, I hope that's actually what you're using it for. I also hope you squash everyone's suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you're autistic, it's not right to be speaking like you're a part of a mistreated group of people when you don't truly know if you're a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we're all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can't speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren't lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol 

If anyone's wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I've been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. 

And if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it's 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don't be shy. :')

According to her, she had been hospitalised after taking 1,500 aspirin and waiting three days to tell anyone. I’ve always been pretty into medicine, so I knew that if that was true she would have bled to death internally very fast, but I didn’t want to start an argument. 

And so began a campaign of some of the most ridiculous behaviour I have ever witnessed.

Right off the bat, she told me that she’d had over 1,000 suicide attempts. This was obviously not particularly believable to start with, but soon I realised that the bar for was qualified as a “suicide attempt” to her was incredibly low. Here’s a list of only SOME of the things she did that she described as suicide attempts:

- Putting her own hands around her neck and squeezing 
- Holding her breath for as long as possible
- Taking four paracetamol
- Gently head butting a wall
- Scratching her arms with her fingernails
- Sticking a pencil up her nose and waiting for someone to notice, then pretending she was going to slam her head into the table
- Swallowing a bead

In addition to this, she pretended to be a heroin addict, and when I asked how she injected the heroin, she mimed injecting the muscle of her upper arm like a vaccine.

Other assorted lies included that she had an identical twin from whom she was separated at birth, and that she had killed a man.

The worst thing she did when I was there actually resulted in me breaking down quite badly. I had a delusion that there were worms eating my brain, and she managed to persuade me that she’d caught the worms off me, and now she was going to die and it was all my fault.

She got discharged unceremoniously a few weeks into my stay, and last I heard of her, she quizzed a girl at the patient’s reunion about her CSA trauma so brutally that said girl jumped into a river.

And that’s only one of the fakers I encountered during my distinguished career as a teenage mental patient. I’ll tell you about the others some other time.",1662223991.0,suicidal

—

I discovered DID when I was 12 in 2020 through Anthony Padilla’s DissociaDID video and binged all of their videos while I was depressed during lockdown. I was going through (like a lot of people) an incredibly difficult time of my life, suicidal, isolated, getting back into self-harm after being clean for years. I was introduced to the concept of PTSD through DissociaDID and started “realizing” that I had it (I’ve been diagnosed with nothing and refuse to self-diagnose in any way). Trauma was resurfacing, relatively shallow things like bullying and childhood emotional neglect. I followed ‘systems’ on Instagram and joined Discord to finally be able to talk to people again. The servers were filled with unstable teenagers. It absolutely sucked, we were each other’s therapists, they were constantly telling me how they wanted to kill themselves, telling me about their self-harm, their eating disorders. There were a decent number of suicide scares and alleged attempts.

One day, someone started saying they had DID.

I was constantly disassociating from myself, feeling empty and severely suicidal, I had one attempt. There was one night during the summer when my family and I were staying in a hotel (before anyone mentions it, yes, disrespecting covid guidelines), where it was too warm to sleep and I was in a feverish delusional state. I fully knew what I was doing was wrong. I got a notebook and wrote down the names, ages and genders of my ‘alters’. I think there were initially 12: children, adults, teens, one or two fictional characters. I definitely took a page out of DissociaDID’s alter intros' book. 

I created a new Discord account, joined the server and immediately posted introductions for every one of my ‘alters’. For the next month, I lied about my life and my trauma, I would answer questions about DID that I knew nothing about. I’ve always had a privileged life with a stable household. The only serious abuse that I am aware of now was sexual abuse at the hands of a family member but this wasn’t something I knew back then. But because I knew DID could only be caused by horrid trauma, I just made it up.

I said that my mother was a Christian fanatic, that I got in a car accident. I felt horrible and paranoid about people finding out I was lying but to me this seemed like the only way out.

I started weeding in actual things from my life: self-harm, suicidality, body issues. It stopped being a character I played and over time the fake trauma was erased and replaced by my real, considerably less severe trauma. It was becoming me and eventually, I was completely convinced that I actually had DID. I was addicted and obsessed with Discord, it became my entire life. My social and academic life crumbled, I would be roleplaying as anime characters in class, on the bus, at home, everywhere. I had no hobbies except for Discord, I stopped making art and had no friends or loved ones. 

Then came the system servers. I initially joined a handful and they were absolute cesspools of echo chambers, manufactured drama and horrible people with horrible advice. A completely new world of people saying that they had 70, 100, or over 500 alters was revealed to me, at that point having amassed around 30 alters and using Pluralkit with aesthetic, detailed descriptions for a decent number of my alters.

**THE PEOPLE**

The (confirmed) oldest people I met in those servers were 31, 30 and in their late 20s. All of them had this sense of entitlement about them: They were the oldest, the smartest, they had the last word and everyone listened to them. They were also the most immature and horrid people I had ever met. The 31-year-old constantly cried about how stressful owning a system server was, how they wanted to kill themselves, finding ways to blame it on the teenage members. The 30-year-old, alarmingly and illegally, stalked a 16-year-old member by finding their legal name on their PayPal and contacting their parents, because they had drama online. I remember 20-year-olds having DDLG fetishes. It was a breeding ground for grooming. And I briefly fell victim to it, being pressured into very sexual talk with someone who was older than me, who also groomed other young members into the same trap. 

There were also adults who I considered at the time as being rational: they would falsely correct you on medical aspects of the disorder you convinced yourself you had, always with the same sense of entitlement and superiority, because they were so knowledgeable. 

Everyone else was a teen like me, with something definitely wrong with them, but that thing not being DID. We listened to everything the adults told us. It was kind of sad, I met a lot of people who, if they had not fallen into the same self-diagnosis trap as I had, could have gotten the correct help they needed in real life and would have found actual friends. We were all close, sharing secrets we told each other, shenanigans we did in general chat and movie nights. Our alters multiplied, as did our self-diagnoses. Our alters got more creative, if someone was using crazy pronouns, everyone else had to step up their game and do it as well. Absurdity isn't absurd anymore when everyone is doing it. There were so-called ‘traumalympics’, people dumping trauma on each other in an attempt to one-up, to be the sickest. I remember being pressured into drinking hard liquor in an attempt to show one of my ‘friends’ that they were not alone and that there were others like them who were sick. However, some people were kind and would try to help each other by providing self-harm recovery resources and other helpful things of the sort.

**THE THINGS THEY WERE SAYING**

* “DID requires any kind of trauma” became “DID requires severe trauma”, so we deluded ourselves into thinking our trauma was severe enough to create DID, and the word ‘abuse’ lost all meaning. Drama = abuse, questioning things = abuse, disagreeing = abuse
* Diagnosis was a gold star and a badge of approval, recovery is bad/undesired and one should always be a system. ‘Fusion’ is evil, and being one person is almost equal to murder
* Introjects (to us this term meant fictional characters or famous people) and polyfragmentation (to us this meant systems with a bunch of alters with super intricate and developed personalities) were the most common and normal thing in the world and magically everyone had hundreds of alters overnight
* Everyone else is responsible for handling your triggers and walking on eggshells around you. If they don’t, that’s abuse. I remember some servers having ‘trigger lists’, which were bullet lists of things that were banned from being said in servers, with dozens of entries, ranging from general topics to the word ‘ok’. If you slipped up, you would be shamed 
* Reality checking and ‘fakeclaiming’ is bad. People should let you rot in your delusions, and if they don’t then they are abusers and you should avoid them
* “If you were faking, then you wouldn’t be questioning whether you are faking, because you already know” was the most damaging of them all. The number of people I have seen be on the edge of breaking out of their delusions only to be pulled back into the nightmarish pit of validation by strangers with the same craving and addiction is heartbreaking.
* Self-diagnosis, in every single case, is good. Any symptom is always equal to a disorder that has to be labeled and put into a pretty jar that you show off to everyone who comes across your messages in the alter-introduction channel
* Subreddits (like this one) are evil, hateful places that you should never go to, never look at, never consume and never dare agree with

If you were to disregard any one of these (un)spoken rules, you were called an abuser or fakeclaimer, cast out, bombarded with people convincing you that you are wrong and that your intentions are malicious and you are a hateful person. Any slight misstep could end with you being stabbed in the stomach by adults who you saw as the gods of these digital cults. 

Like so many, in an attempt to garner validation, I would shove myself into however or whatever would hear me out. I would post DID content on Tumblr and Instagram, I would post self-validation on this subreddit or r/SystemsCringe (how the turntables) and would freak out if anyone called out my bullshit. At some point, I had around 300 'alters', was self-identified as a 'polyfragmented introject heavy OSDD-1b system', and would try to convince anyone that I could that this was a very rational thing for me to be.

—

After a year of faking DID, I left all of these big servers, probably over some drama that meant nothing. I deleted all of my DID-oriented social media (which was an incredible decision) and stayed in small servers of ‘systems’ that were less cult-ish, but were still validation farms for their owners. Unbelievably, away from the echo chambers we were used to, we actually start gaining common sense. It was difficult, but many of us started accepting that we don’t and never have had DID, that we are simply sick in a different way. For some of us, often the ones in therapy, with real friends or support systems, the transition to being a single person again was easier. For others, like me, it was more difficult. It had been a year and a half that I had been faking DID, and my transition began with the deletion of most alters from my Pluralkit, keeping only the ‘active’ ones, until I deleted my Pluralkit entirely, which single-handedly put me on track for getting my life back. I made real friends, stopped saying I was a system on Discord until one day I could say, without fear of being hated and shamed, that I wasn’t.

I felt horrible about what I had done. I knew that it was a moment of desperation, a shared delusion I was unfortunate enough to have been sucked into. But honestly all I could think about was what people with real DID have to go through on a daily basis. No medical textbook I had read, no interview I had watched would ever be able to cover the horrors of their daily lives and I felt ashamed of ever trying to mimic their lives in a vain attempt to get the love I was craving.

And I felt empty.

My alters were so distinct, they all had likes and interests that no longer felt appealing to me. I didn’t know what music I liked, what things I wanted to eat, what I wanted to be called or what clothes I wanted to wear. It used to come so naturally with whatever alter I thought I was any given morning but now that I knew I had always been all of them nothing came to mind. I would look for symptoms in everything. It is a mindset that is difficult to this day to get rid of. There is a lot that I haven't mentioned, but I'm not going to post about this again, maybe I'll write a book some day or something (kidding, I hope not)

I am doing better now, I have friends, my relationship with my parents has significantly improved. I deleted Discord in September of 2022, which was the best decision I have ever made. I am still suffering mentally, but I am 4 months (!) self-harm-free. I am considering coming out as transgender and getting treatment for my mental health.

My social skills are recovering and I am finally learning things about myself. I still think about how easy it used to feel, and I do want to go back sometimes. DID faking was surprisingly similar, to me, to what an addiction feels like, but I have set my mind to never relapse into it.

If you are reading this and you identify as a system, I am not here to dismiss you or your symptoms. All I ask is for you to put down your social media for a week and reflect. Don’t think about symptoms and what they mean, think about who YOU are as a person. 

Who are you without whatever disorder you believe you have?

No matter who you are, you are loved and cherished by someone out there. And if there is no one, there is me. 

I’m ready to move on.

Update:

Felt the need to respond to a few recurring theme in the comment section:

""Kids will be Kids"" is not, and never will be, a good reason for doing things like this. I do not care if you are 14 or 30, there needs to be consequences for these actions. Being young does not excuse behavior, and bad actions need to be dealt with. An apology is never good enough for repeated and intentional behavior.

Yes I remember being a Kid for the most part. I also remember ""Boys will be boys"". Usually said after I was assaulted, or harassed, or had things stolen. Boys allowed to do horrible things all because ""They just don't know any better."". 

Ya'll are no different than the ""Adults"" in these situations except now it is gender neutral, and everyone gets let off the hook.

""They didn't kill anyone, chill out."" seems to be echoed a few times. They may not have pulled a trigger or stabbed someone, but do you really think that fakers have no blood on their hands? How many suicides do you think are the direct result of these fakers making people who live with these disorders lives harder? 

In a world where the stigma around mental health needs no help, these fakers feel the need to offer it anyways. They spread dangerous misinformation and perceptions which are not just isolated to their echo chambers. Which they do by choice.

Just to be clear, everyone saying I need to ""chill"" has the situation grossly misunderstood. This is about as ""chill"" as I can be given the situation, and honestly I would say I have kept a really cool head in the face of some very ignorant things coming my way.

Due to how this just kind of went nuts, I am going to be putting this baby to sleep on my end.

They keep forcing symptoms and saying thinks like ""Omg, you're probably abandoning me, I'm sorry if I'm wrong, It's my BPD 😕"" ""You're keeping things from me 🥺"" ""You probably all hate me"". They also flex their BPD, like when I talk about mental health, they always dance and shit and say ""So me, My BPD is so crazy"". 

And whenever I try to talk about my mental health, they make it all about them. I can't even talk to them anymore bro.

Can someone give me advice on this and tell me if they're faking? I'm not even sure but I don't think at their age they should be saying they have this disorder or self diagnosing with it.

Back when this stuff first started, the trend was depression and anxiety. People accepted these diagnoses as sufficient explanations for their suffering as they were still viewed as incredibly serious conditions.

However, they were continually “watered down” as more people jumped on the trend and claimed depression and anxiety. The accounts you started to see online equated Normal Human Emotions to the level of clinical depression or anxiety. Nowadays, most people (especially teens) don’t seem to view the disorders as genuinely debilitating conditions. If the influencers with depression can get out of bed, function exceptionally well, and keep up with obligations, why can’t you when you have the same diagnoses as them? 

Clearly what you have is much more severe than what they have. So it can’t just be regular old depression. It has to be something **worse**.



You can see this pattern playing out in real time with the whole ADHD and autism thing. Initially, ADHD was the trend. People who were INCREDIBLY successful and functional were getting diagnosed and became the loudest voices in the community. So if you **can’t** do those things, it must be something worse. So everyone started to say it was “severe” ADHD. Or that they had ADHD-C. But after those terms were co-opted by fakers or those with more mild presentations, they too were viewed as not “bad enough” to explain the issue someone was having.


So it must be comorbid autism and ADHD. And the cycle continues.",1674404078.0,anxiety

She's definitely not hyperactive as she can stay still for the same amount of time as every other neurotypical, she can almost always pay attention unless she chooses not to and she rarely loses things and basically shows no symptoms of adhd.

However, within the last few weeks she suddenly started 'not paying attention' and whenever someone tells her something she says that she zoned out half way through what they were saying. It's quite frustrating since she wasnt like this until our other friend (i'll call him joe) said that he thinks he might have adhd and is considering getting a diagnosis. Joe has shown most symptoms of adhd for as long as ive known him (we met about 5-6 years ago) so i think it's fair for him to think this.

Liz decided that we should all take an online adhd test for fun around 3 weeks ago, so we did. While she was taking her test she kept strongly agreeing with a bunch of questions which I would have disagreed with if i was her. I understand that symptoms can be hidden but i dont think thats the case with her since shes the kind of person to try and seem as weird as she can to be quirky and she also likes searching up random things to find disorders and suggest she might have them. After we took the test she got the results which said she is likely to have adhd. She sounded really happy about this but then I told her about how the symptoms are supposed to be there from most of your life (I think from around 7 years old at least?) rather than just randomly appearing recently and she seemed really annoyed and claimed that she doesnt remember when she was younger so she cant take the test accurately. She had also done this same test a few months ago and it said she most likely didn't have adhd.

I can't stop being friends with her since i know joe and our other friends would stay with her and i'm terrible at making friends so i would be left with no one.

Several years ago, as they have done more research, the diagnostic criteria has improved substantially & people in their *30s & 40s* who had struggled for decades with symptoms they couldn't make sense of suddenly had the puzzle pieced together for them & it was a revelation. 

It's true a diagnosis can be cost prohibitive in one of if not the most expensive healthcare system on the planet, particularly for **adults**. Thanks to CHIP, all minors are covered by CHIP up to a very generous threshold & there are programs to ensure their mental health care is covered regardless of the parents' ability to pay. Adults don't have that same luxury. If you can't afford private or employer funded insurance, Obamacare, Medicaid/Medicare, or pay out of pocket, you're fucked. 

Pretty much all of these people have had their diagnosis confirmed by a doctor since based on access. This wasn't from people who watched a few TikTok videos but because they'd spent even *years* researching it at first. While the concept remains controversial, it was specific to autism, ADHD, etc not complex mental disorders.

My daughter & my nephew are both autistic. It's a long process of testing and conferring with specialists to reach a unanimous diagnosis, especially in children/minors because there's so much else it could be at that stage of development. She started early intervention at 3 & was diagnosed at 5. A lot went into it. 

Bipolar, any personality disorder, especially schizophrenia or DID ffs, OCD, clinical forms of depression or anxiety disorders, etc all absolutely require an official diagnosis. Very, very, *very* few laypersons understand the DSM. And still not enough compared to someone who want to school for a decade to know how to actually apply it.

And when anybody self diagnoses or fakes mental illnesses i look down on them really hard. 
Sorry for the long prologue,but anyway
since the very beginning of thế relationship, he would casually say he’s autistic everytime i struggled with other people. And after awhile he’d say he was bipolar when it was actually more similar to girls when we PMS.I tried to get used to that. And after the breakup, during his “apology” he actually said i wasnt the problem but his DID. And i was just so embarrassed. Because we live in an place where the doctors here dont even have the authority to diagnose something so rare and severe like that. i had to go to another state just for my diagnosis for autism  and my other problems but it felt so insulting for him to fake something like a child.

495,7783.0,faking illness isn't always a sign of mental illness in itself,39,106mmmz,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/106mmmz/faking_illness_isnt_always_a_sign_of_mental/,3,"This whole ""a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they're faking"" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they're doing and still want to feel validated for it. 
Let me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who's probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. 
Of course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. 

See, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. 
But while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. 

It first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don't need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it's easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing ""depressed"" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today's teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren't. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. 

Then we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I'm not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that's as far as my memory goes and I'd appreciate elaboration. 

Now, it's important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it's not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I'm sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as ""damaged"". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. 

Today, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It's actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you're born with it, it's not developed from trauma... 
But anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn't identify as that) you talk to chances are she's gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it's actually so wide spread that it's unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I've tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It's incredibly depressing, and it's a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word 'depressing' just now, it's no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you'd be looked down on it for because you don't have a mental illness that implies that you've went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don't even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that's developed from lots of trauma and it's kind of just assumed that you're living a ""hellish life"".

Now back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they're in. It's just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. 
You're not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that's causing you to be an attention seeker. You're faking because it's simply what everyone around you is doing, it's what's deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it's what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. 
That does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren't the reason they're faking. 
And that's honestly not even those teens' faults. I'm sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it's important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. 

These people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you've been struggling with for years. But here's the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;
Being medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you're going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there's actually very few mental illness that cannot be ""fixed"". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. 
But all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a ""thropy"" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it's not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what's the point in knowing that you're a DID system if you're not going to take the time to become apart of those ""singlet"" people that you love insulting so much?

i have this ""friend"" of mine who is claiming to have a bunch of disorders (tics, ADHD, depression, anxiety and anorexia) and i wanna go over all of them a bit. they really do go to a therapist btw and apparently do have an ADHD diagnosis its still a bit sus tho  
just before i start, they say theyre nonbinary but use all pronouns, so dont bash me if i say she throughout this post, im a trans guy myself :)  
i am btw currently 14 and visit a high school ig (school where i come from is weird) but this all started in like middle school. 2021 after the huge covid break where it was homeschooling  
 they came up to me one day in school and started telling me how annoying their therapist is and that she just wants to get her depression diagnosis. this isnt how therapy works? ig? idk i didnt go to therapy yet but you dont go there and be like ""diagnose me with depression"" or smth like that. i just took it like that bc at the time, i was just trying to survive and stay closeted i was really afraid due to anxiety issues but thats not the topic. but her depression came out of nowhere with no apparent trigger? and they didnt really show any symptoms and the only thing they really did was c\*t themselves and making jokingly plans about s\*!cide (i say theyre jokes bc she was \*always\*  laughing when this was happening and took it really lightly, which was and still is pretty triggering for me and makes me really uncomfortable) and they never actually got diagnosed with it.  


next i wanna go over their anxiety and panic attacks and shit. i suffer from panic attacks etc too and i know it looks different for every person, but they litereallly used it as an excuse. im gonna take for example one story from last year, im just gonna call them ""S"": it was just a regular morning and we had class with a teacher we both dont like for reasons that i dont want to talk abt. so S just went up to that teacher, stating that they have a panic attack and need to go outside with me to calm down, which my teacher would do bc she is understanding with stuff like this. so me and S went outside so they could ""calm down"" and it was so annoying. she was just walking around me in a circle which made me really uncomfortable bc i felt trapped, which i tried to say but they didnt stop. and they were all chit chatty and laughy and it didnt feel at all like they were doing bad, until the teacher came outside to check on them. then ofc evetrhing was abd again and they could in no way go inside nonono. they did that again when the teacher came back again but then even she had enough of that bs and made us go inside. so yea they def be faking that/overdramatizing that one  
their anorexia might have legit  symptoms alltough they kinda just dropped that one at one point and eat completely normal again now

now my ""favourite"" thing that S was faking (this is sorta a 2 in one but with the ADHD i am not sure theyre faking, it might be legit. their experiences/symptoms are just different then mine i suppose.)  
anyway, buckle up for this amazing/s story  
this also happened 2021 when we came back to school, all of this did, she probably just spent too much time on tt during quarantine lmao.  
anyway, at some point completely randomly S started claiming they have tics. at first it was nothing severe, just some head jolts or maybe a hand movement, nothing severe, nothing ""special"". my best friend and my boyfriend both have a tic disorder so i didnt mind and i was used to it. at first S claimed it was tourettes, which would be like the most plausible thing to say when you claim to have tics i suppose (not saying that this is justified, im just trying to think with her mind or smth). after a while this all started to get more severe, vocal tics started to accur on a regullar basis up until a point where i could have ""conversations"" with their tics. the ""best"" part of this tho that suddenly their tics werent tourettes anymore, it was their ADHD. I am not sure that they are faking it, and apparently she did get a diagnosis for it but the tics they had were too severe to be from their ADHD. it can in rare cases cause minor tics, but not tics of this severety. they were also only ticcing when it was convient for them and suddenly all out of nowhere when they got medication for adhd, not a single tic ever to be seen again.

i am very sorry for this rant, i know this is supposed to be a memey cringey subreddit, but this has been on my mind for a while and i felt like putting this here since i am in a very bad mental place and this is still sorta going on and also some other shit with S is going on that doesnt belong here tho.

I recently listened to a podcast that told the story and events of The Dancing Plague. Frau Troffea suddenly began dancing at a party one night with her husband. After a while, her husband tried getting her to stop. She wouldn't. She danced and danced until she collapsed. When she awoke, she immediately went back to dancing. Some thought it was a joke, or that she did it in spite of her husband, whom she was arguing with the night of the party. She quickly became dehydrated and exhausted, but she didn't stop dancing.

Suddenly, one other person started dancing and could not stop. It was like they were in a trance. They couldn't speak, couldn't communicate, nothing. Just dancing.

So what? It's just two idiots on drugs or going crazy, right?

Well, later that night, more people began dancing. Even when there was no music, people continued dancing. Slowly over the days, people debilitated and were dancing on broken ankles, torn skin, and infected lesions. But no matter what, more and more joined. Women would even get out of bed in the middle of the night to parade the town and dance nonstop.

Eventually, a man decided to try and put an end to this madness. He ordered the entire city and all of the inhabitants to party until they couldn't party anymore.

He did more damage. More people began dancing and couldn't stop. Eventually, 400 people were dancing until complete exhaustion (estimated). People would collapse, wake up, and continue to dance. Others had to water the dancers so they wouldn't die of dehydration. It seemed to never end.

Finally, as quickly as it started, it in fact did end. No one knows the cause. It's believed to be caused by some social aspect in our DNA. We don't know if everyone there just believed they were sick as well, therefore they started dancing and couldn't stop. Some think the women started doing it in anger towards their husbands, only for the rest of the town to believe it was a contagious disease that they had.

In the modern world, this still happens. For example, [The Le Roy Girls](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html). And I'm sorry I don't have more examples, it's 3AM and I'm ready to wrap this up. There is a podcast by Ashley Flowers on Spotify called Supernatural that goes very in depth about The Dancing Plague and the MANY modern cases we have today (it also includes the idea that this could happen again, but on a much more massive playing field due to social media).



Anywayyyyys.

I feel that this could be the same thing. Such as The Dancing Plague, no one knows what caused it. It could have been mass hysteria, anxiety, an actual disease, a virus, or a mass hoax orchestrated by certain people that developed into mass hysteria. It could be possible that these teens feel the need to receive attention and then truly make themselves believe they have disorders, which is another theory of The Dancing Plague. Maybe these teens see TikTok disorders as their Frau Troffea.

If you read this, you're fucking insane and I love you.

TL;DR

In 1518, a plague took over a town causing everyone to dance nonstop. The townspeople believed the first victim was doing it for attention. Suddenly, the whole town found themselves dancing nonstop. There are modern cases of this still happening today and I feel that this could be one, but on social media.",1616400419.0,anxiety
498,7795.0,Some conclusions I have reached about self-diagnosis,5,10ex6vj,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/10ex6vj/some_conclusions_i_have_reached_about/,7,"Since i had access to internet from a young age, like many of you, i've been part of the self-diagnosis wave that happened both on tumblr and tiktok. At first, i saw no problem with it but then i found various people claiming that it was something wrong. There were many arguments against it, and though i agreed with it being wrong, i was not satisfied with them because they wouldn't explain it as a whole. Some people would just point at self-diagnosed people as bad, and being someone who believes people are not bad natured, i wasn't satisfied and wanted an actual answer. Something that would explain why so many people crave it, why it became more popular or how to stop it. Specially for myself, since i was constantly looking for diagnosis even though i knew i shouldn't do it.

Today, after some time thinking about it, listening to other people and analysing myself, i think i've finally arrived with some answers that give me peace and can be helpful for other people. Hope you can comment whether you agree with this compilation or not. 

**Why do i think people self-diagnose?** 

Here i want to differentiate between those who are self-diagnosed and make it public, with those who don't, because the first group may have other factors to take into account. 

From what i remember, the tumblr self-diagnosis wave wasn't as scattered as this new wave is, but the recent one may show the causes behind it. Before COVID-19, mental health was pretty much taboo. People were uncomfortable talking about it, no one would actually take it as serious business, just someone being 'weak'. Then, the pandemic enabled mental health struggles to become more common. People were hurting and didn't know how to name it, what was the problem or how to make it stop. They needed answers and would eventually find posts about mental health that acknowledge their difficulties. This was completaly fine until the fast pace and quickness of social media would spread the wrong message with vague or even incorrect information. To sum up, people seek validation, attention, help through self-diagnosis but social media blurred the line between struggles and illness and as we know, people don't actually make a further investigation of what they see on social media, so most of them won't even know what DSM-V is. They just use the name that seems to describe their struggles even if they dont actually understand what the name implies. 

Nevertheless, we got other vectors when we talk about young people. For example, the search of identity  and as we know, they're more prone to seek social validation. They usually desire to be accepted by their social group, so if we mix the simplifaction of mental health, it's popularity, lack of experience and lots of isolation, the desire of an identity and some struggles that may be normal for their age, we come up with videos of people claiming that it's quirky, cute and even ""sexy"" to have autism when i don't think it's something you really want to shout out all happy about it and i'm not saying autistic people should be ashamed. I don't have autism, so i may not understand it at all and i cannot say that all people feel the same way about their divergency because it's a different experience for everybody, but there are some things that may not be enjoyable like meltdowns, or shutdowns, or being looked at when you just want to cover your needs but people won't really understand it because it can be a debilitating condition.  Obviously, i wont say that all people that self-diagnose are wrong because it's clear that there might be persons with mental illness that are not professionaly diagnosed, but i dont think it's possible to so many people to have autism, tourettes or even a complex condition as DID. 

**Do i consider self-diagnosis wrong?** 

No, but let me explain myself. I acknowledge the argument that a diagnosis may be expensive, and if you've been struggling, internet may offer you some help. At least to recognize what it may be, talk to other people about it and acoplate your life to your needs. However, i think it's extremally important to do an actual research and eventually go to a professional. Not only to confirm the diagnosis but to recieve the help that you need. Other's perspectives of you may be helpful because we tend to have a disturbed self-image, so talking about your symptoms to other people and discuss about it can give you a wider perspective about it but it's extremally important to be careful. Why? Because there is a difference between struggling and being ill. You may not want to treat someone with gastroenteritis the same way you treat someone with diabetes. They both may be hurting, they both deserve attention, but they have different needs and level of urgency. If we don't give the enough importance to mark the difference, people with severe conditions can be affected. Things like chronic depression, generalized anxiety, autism, BPD, Tourettes are daily debilitating conditions that are way more complex. I think it's better to leave big names to big conditions, to give it it's proper importance.

**Conclusion of conclusions** 

Basically, people crave attention, validation or help because they're human beings, they might be struggling and that's completaly fine, but it's important to differentiate between struggling and being ill.

499,7796.0,About Eizawolfe and Stigma,282,jlf328,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/jlf328/about_eizawolfe_and_stigma/,44,"If you're here on this subreddit from her recent TikTok, I want you to hear me out. Before anything else, I want to make perfectly clear I do not wish any harm on this young lady and I do not know whether or not she actually has autism. No one in this subreddit knows for certain because none of us have properly assessed her in the ways only a doctor can. I will say, however, that the information she has given to the public does not make sense and has therefore caused suspicion that she is not telling the truth. I will be talking about why this suspicion came about, but before getting into that, I want to talk about why what she is doing is harmful not only to her but also to other people regardless of whether or not she actually has autism.

The majority of the people on this subreddit have been diagnosed with disorders, disabilities, and/or mental illnesses. We have experienced first-hand the consequences of other people self-diagnosing and seeking attention. There are people who have been bullied, assaulted, refused treatment, refused medication, and yes, there are people who have died because of this problem. What self-diagnosers and attention-seekers do is add to the stigma associated with disorders and mental illness. Some of you might be thinking I'm blowing this way out of proportion, but those of you who have been properly diagnosed will understand I am not, and I'd greatly appreciate you telling your story in the comments and/or providing references you may have to further educate these people who do not understand. 

Here's one reference on combatting the stigma of mental illness: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477

Notice how receiving treatment is one of the ways to combat the stigma. However, you cannot receive treatment if you have not been diagnosed by someone that's QUALIFIED to make a diagnosis. YOU are not qualified to diagnose yourself. Even if you were a doctor, you could not diagnose yourself. Even if you have a family member who is a doctor, they cannot diagnose you. This is because of ethics, which are purposefully put in place to protect patients. 

There is a reason why doctors have to go through such rigorous schooling. There is a reason why they need to be updated on research. There is a reason why many of them conduct research themselves. This is so they can learn to properly DIAGNOSE and TREAT patients. 

Are there bad doctors out there? Yep. Can doctors make mistakes? Yep. Can doctors be unsure of what to do? Yep. Does one type of doctor not know everything? Yep. 

This is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.

(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you'd think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it's not.)

Now that I'm done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I'm going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you're reading this, perhaps you'd be willing to clear a few things up. 

(I'm going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)

1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm not saying you can't look up your symptoms and go, ""Hey maybe I've got this!"" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, ""But my therapist thinks I'm autistic and other doctors too!"" Doesn't matter, they're apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That's why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. 

2. It's entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn't real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn't have. What doesn't make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. 

3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver's test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. 

4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you're paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn't make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I'm likely to get bombarded with, ""but her health insurance doesn't cover anyone else!!!!"" Definitely possible, but it'd be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that's willing to diagnose you for that much money. 

5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you're sitting in front of what you said was ""some random woman sleeping behind you."" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there's a whole lot of you going outside so... ???

I can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I'll save you some time. Yes, it's possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn't talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn't make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that'd clear things up. It's public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. 

Note: Don't go harass her on Instagram. 

A lot of things to make this long post even longer: 
Eizawolfe, you took people's money for a diagnosis, I hope that's actually what you're using it for. I also hope you squash everyone's suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you're autistic, it's not right to be speaking like you're a part of a mistreated group of people when you don't truly know if you're a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we're all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can't speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren't lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol 

If anyone's wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I've been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. 

And if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it's 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don't be shy. :')

My name is Val (not my real name), I’m 15 and I stopped faking DID a year ago. Before you get any further into reading this post, I’d like to set a few rules for commenting:

* Do not send me validation (“This wasn’t your fault” “You were young” etc.). I’ve been debating making this post because I still crave the validation mentioned in my story, but in order to fully close this shitty chapter of my life I feel compelled to share my experience to hopefully stop others from going through what I went through. 
* Do not post self-validation: If you identify as a system, don’t post “Well I’m a real system because x and y”. If you feel the need to validate yourself, you are exactly who this post is meant for. I understand why you want to comment these things but I ask you to set that urge aside for 10 minutes and just read what I have to say
* **I am NOT looking for advice** about **ANY** part of my life that I have shared here. This rule is very much being disrespected and I would appreciate for it to be followed going forward 

This post is long but I just ask you to bear with me. **If you feel that it is too long for you I understand and wish you a good day, but ask you not to downvote it for its size**. With all of that being said, here is how and why I faked DID and what effects it has on my life now. Have a fun read.

—

I discovered DID when I was 12 in 2020 through Anthony Padilla’s DissociaDID video and binged all of their videos while I was depressed during lockdown. I was going through (like a lot of people) an incredibly difficult time of my life, suicidal, isolated, getting back into self-harm after being clean for years. I was introduced to the concept of PTSD through DissociaDID and started “realizing” that I had it (I’ve been diagnosed with nothing and refuse to self-diagnose in any way). Trauma was resurfacing, relatively shallow things like bullying and childhood emotional neglect. I followed ‘systems’ on Instagram and joined Discord to finally be able to talk to people again. The servers were filled with unstable teenagers. It absolutely sucked, we were each other’s therapists, they were constantly telling me how they wanted to kill themselves, telling me about their self-harm, their eating disorders. There were a decent number of suicide scares and alleged attempts.

One day, someone started saying they had DID.

I was constantly disassociating from myself, feeling empty and severely suicidal, I had one attempt. There was one night during the summer when my family and I were staying in a hotel (before anyone mentions it, yes, disrespecting covid guidelines), where it was too warm to sleep and I was in a feverish delusional state. I fully knew what I was doing was wrong. I got a notebook and wrote down the names, ages and genders of my ‘alters’. I think there were initially 12: children, adults, teens, one or two fictional characters. I definitely took a page out of DissociaDID’s alter intros' book. 

I created a new Discord account, joined the server and immediately posted introductions for every one of my ‘alters’. For the next month, I lied about my life and my trauma, I would answer questions about DID that I knew nothing about. I’ve always had a privileged life with a stable household. The only serious abuse that I am aware of now was sexual abuse at the hands of a family member but this wasn’t something I knew back then. But because I knew DID could only be caused by horrid trauma, I just made it up.

I said that my mother was a Christian fanatic, that I got in a car accident. I felt horrible and paranoid about people finding out I was lying but to me this seemed like the only way out.

I started weeding in actual things from my life: self-harm, suicidality, body issues. It stopped being a character I played and over time the fake trauma was erased and replaced by my real, considerably less severe trauma. It was becoming me and eventually, I was completely convinced that I actually had DID. I was addicted and obsessed with Discord, it became my entire life. My social and academic life crumbled, I would be roleplaying as anime characters in class, on the bus, at home, everywhere. I had no hobbies except for Discord, I stopped making art and had no friends or loved ones. 

Then came the system servers. I initially joined a handful and they were absolute cesspools of echo chambers, manufactured drama and horrible people with horrible advice. A completely new world of people saying that they had 70, 100, or over 500 alters was revealed to me, at that point having amassed around 30 alters and using Pluralkit with aesthetic, detailed descriptions for a decent number of my alters.

**THE PEOPLE**

The (confirmed) oldest people I met in those servers were 31, 30 and in their late 20s. All of them had this sense of entitlement about them: They were the oldest, the smartest, they had the last word and everyone listened to them. They were also the most immature and horrid people I had ever met. The 31-year-old constantly cried about how stressful owning a system server was, how they wanted to kill themselves, finding ways to blame it on the teenage members. The 30-year-old, alarmingly and illegally, stalked a 16-year-old member by finding their legal name on their PayPal and contacting their parents, because they had drama online. I remember 20-year-olds having DDLG fetishes. It was a breeding ground for grooming. And I briefly fell victim to it, being pressured into very sexual talk with someone who was older than me, who also groomed other young members into the same trap. 

There were also adults who I considered at the time as being rational: they would falsely correct you on medical aspects of the disorder you convinced yourself you had, always with the same sense of entitlement and superiority, because they were so knowledgeable. 

Everyone else was a teen like me, with something definitely wrong with them, but that thing not being DID. We listened to everything the adults told us. It was kind of sad, I met a lot of people who, if they had not fallen into the same self-diagnosis trap as I had, could have gotten the correct help they needed in real life and would have found actual friends. We were all close, sharing secrets we told each other, shenanigans we did in general chat and movie nights. Our alters multiplied, as did our self-diagnoses. Our alters got more creative, if someone was using crazy pronouns, everyone else had to step up their game and do it as well. Absurdity isn't absurd anymore when everyone is doing it. There were so-called ‘traumalympics’, people dumping trauma on each other in an attempt to one-up, to be the sickest. I remember being pressured into drinking hard liquor in an attempt to show one of my ‘friends’ that they were not alone and that there were others like them who were sick. However, some people were kind and would try to help each other by providing self-harm recovery resources and other helpful things of the sort.

**THE THINGS THEY WERE SAYING**

* “DID requires any kind of trauma” became “DID requires severe trauma”, so we deluded ourselves into thinking our trauma was severe enough to create DID, and the word ‘abuse’ lost all meaning. Drama = abuse, questioning things = abuse, disagreeing = abuse
* Diagnosis was a gold star and a badge of approval, recovery is bad/undesired and one should always be a system. ‘Fusion’ is evil, and being one person is almost equal to murder
* Introjects (to us this term meant fictional characters or famous people) and polyfragmentation (to us this meant systems with a bunch of alters with super intricate and developed personalities) were the most common and normal thing in the world and magically everyone had hundreds of alters overnight
* Everyone else is responsible for handling your triggers and walking on eggshells around you. If they don’t, that’s abuse. I remember some servers having ‘trigger lists’, which were bullet lists of things that were banned from being said in servers, with dozens of entries, ranging from general topics to the word ‘ok’. If you slipped up, you would be shamed 
* Reality checking and ‘fakeclaiming’ is bad. People should let you rot in your delusions, and if they don’t then they are abusers and you should avoid them
* “If you were faking, then you wouldn’t be questioning whether you are faking, because you already know” was the most damaging of them all. The number of people I have seen be on the edge of breaking out of their delusions only to be pulled back into the nightmarish pit of validation by strangers with the same craving and addiction is heartbreaking.
* Self-diagnosis, in every single case, is good. Any symptom is always equal to a disorder that has to be labeled and put into a pretty jar that you show off to everyone who comes across your messages in the alter-introduction channel
* Subreddits (like this one) are evil, hateful places that you should never go to, never look at, never consume and never dare agree with

If you were to disregard any one of these (un)spoken rules, you were called an abuser or fakeclaimer, cast out, bombarded with people convincing you that you are wrong and that your intentions are malicious and you are a hateful person. Any slight misstep could end with you being stabbed in the stomach by adults who you saw as the gods of these digital cults. 

Like so many, in an attempt to garner validation, I would shove myself into however or whatever would hear me out. I would post DID content on Tumblr and Instagram, I would post self-validation on this subreddit or r/SystemsCringe (how the turntables) and would freak out if anyone called out my bullshit. At some point, I had around 300 'alters', was self-identified as a 'polyfragmented introject heavy OSDD-1b system', and would try to convince anyone that I could that this was a very rational thing for me to be.

—

After a year of faking DID, I left all of these big servers, probably over some drama that meant nothing. I deleted all of my DID-oriented social media (which was an incredible decision) and stayed in small servers of ‘systems’ that were less cult-ish, but were still validation farms for their owners. Unbelievably, away from the echo chambers we were used to, we actually start gaining common sense. It was difficult, but many of us started accepting that we don’t and never have had DID, that we are simply sick in a different way. For some of us, often the ones in therapy, with real friends or support systems, the transition to being a single person again was easier. For others, like me, it was more difficult. It had been a year and a half that I had been faking DID, and my transition began with the deletion of most alters from my Pluralkit, keeping only the ‘active’ ones, until I deleted my Pluralkit entirely, which single-handedly put me on track for getting my life back. I made real friends, stopped saying I was a system on Discord until one day I could say, without fear of being hated and shamed, that I wasn’t.

I felt horrible about what I had done. I knew that it was a moment of desperation, a shared delusion I was unfortunate enough to have been sucked into. But honestly all I could think about was what people with real DID have to go through on a daily basis. No medical textbook I had read, no interview I had watched would ever be able to cover the horrors of their daily lives and I felt ashamed of ever trying to mimic their lives in a vain attempt to get the love I was craving.

And I felt empty.

My alters were so distinct, they all had likes and interests that no longer felt appealing to me. I didn’t know what music I liked, what things I wanted to eat, what I wanted to be called or what clothes I wanted to wear. It used to come so naturally with whatever alter I thought I was any given morning but now that I knew I had always been all of them nothing came to mind. I would look for symptoms in everything. It is a mindset that is difficult to this day to get rid of. There is a lot that I haven't mentioned, but I'm not going to post about this again, maybe I'll write a book some day or something (kidding, I hope not)

I am doing better now, I have friends, my relationship with my parents has significantly improved. I deleted Discord in September of 2022, which was the best decision I have ever made. I am still suffering mentally, but I am 4 months (!) self-harm-free. I am considering coming out as transgender and getting treatment for my mental health.

My social skills are recovering and I am finally learning things about myself. I still think about how easy it used to feel, and I do want to go back sometimes. DID faking was surprisingly similar, to me, to what an addiction feels like, but I have set my mind to never relapse into it.

If you are reading this and you identify as a system, I am not here to dismiss you or your symptoms. All I ask is for you to put down your social media for a week and reflect. Don’t think about symptoms and what they mean, think about who YOU are as a person. 

Who are you without whatever disorder you believe you have?

No matter who you are, you are loved and cherished by someone out there. And if there is no one, there is me. 

I’m ready to move on.

Personality states do not become distinct or fully formed until much later in life, if at all. Therapy usually slows down the process of this if the person struggling with it realises they might have something wrong with them and seeks help. Because of the amnesia barriers, they still wouldn’t know who the alters are and wouldn’t be able to communicate with them. So, they wouldn’t know their gender identity or pronouns or mental illness or whatnot. (Note: There can be some level of communication between alters, but that is also really rare because of the amnesia).

Another thing these fakers do is claim each alter has different mental illnesses or conditions. Again, this is a red flag. Although not much research has gone into this disorder because of how incredibly fucking rare it is, the research that has been done shows that a personality state could have a different mental illness than what the “body” has, but not neurological conditions. The brain is incredibly unique, but it has the same structure no matter who’s fronting. Since tourette’s syndrome, for example, is a result of the brain structure being different or “warped”, another alter would still have it. The alter may cause amnesia/memory loss but there is an extremely minuscule chance it would change the brain structure every time they fronted too. I have seen some people posted on this subreddit who also claim different alters can be paralysed from the waist/neck down when other alters don’t.. and wtf? Were they not taught body autonomy? 

This is basic knowledge, but no, you can’t transfer your alters to another system. It’s not pokémon cards. You can’t trade them, you can’t have copies of them, just no. 

Another thing that’s widely debated amongst medical professionals is fictives or irls or whatever these “systems” call them. Fictives do exist, but they are extremely rare and if one were to form, it would be before or around the age of 8 and would’ve taken multiple years, no Arson, not two years, two years isn’t long enough for your dream smp alters to form, it would’ve taken from around 8 years or more to form them. Fictives are formed when the brain latches onto a character that it thinks could protect them from harm and from the trauma that even caused their disorder. 

This brings me onto my last point: endogenic systems. To put it simply; they aren’t real. You can have an imagination without claiming to have a severe lifelong traumatic disorder (minus the trauma in endogenic systems) and no one is going to attack you. DID is formed by multiple years of severe trauma, around or before the age of 8. It’s not your mom yelling at you to do your chores, it’s severe trauma. It’s trauma severe enough that the brain believes the original personality state would only be of harm if they remembered it, so it created other personality states that could take in the trauma. 

One teensy last thing worth noting, you can’t switch alters on command. Alters switch when there is a negative trigger, that is a trauma response. It is kind of like how if someone with PTSD had a trigger of their trauma then they’d have a breakdown, except someone with DID would switch alters really subtly and then switch back when the threat is gone or over. You just can’t have a positive trigger either, because you wouldn’t know what each alter likes unless you were informed by a family member or your therapist. 

Before I post this I wanted to say that every DID system is of course different, and if any GENUINE ones need to fix something i’ve said in the comments I will change my wording. I, myself, do not have DID so i can’t speak on behalf of the community, but this is just what i’ve found through research.

Fictives can form in the space of a year or more, but the amount of trauma that would’ve been caused then would’ve not allowed them to realise. It’s important to know that alters don’t just form out of nowhere, they form due to trauma. A large amount of trauma.",1662192027.0,trauma
507,8094.0,A group of kids in my GSA are TikTok fakers.,1180,xhzrbq,fakedisordercringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakedisordercringe/comments/xhzrbq/a_group_of_kids_in_my_gsa_are_tiktok_fakers/,148,"It’s genuinely the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. I’m the leader of GSA (genders and sexualities alliance) where I attend school, and ho boy, do they know how to make meetings interesting.

Obviously as the leader, it’s my job to keep things running so that we can hold fundraisers and sales and create a supportive environment for everyone. These kids (they are all fairly younger than I am, being that I’m the oldest there and they’re underclassmen) make every meeting about them. Two of them fake tics like their life depends on it which includes yelling out random things during the meetings that are disruptive and cause problems because they do it over and over again. Obviously, if someone in the group genuinely had Tourette’s or anything else that caused tics, I would have no problem with this! But these kids are fakers who are looking for attention.

They call any small inconvenience “trauma” and all say that they are “professionally self diagnosed with autism” (you see the contradiction there?) by listing normal human behavior (one told me they don’t like salad and so they have a food aversion, which means they are automatically autistic) as symptoms. It’s insufferable. And I know they are faking because this behavior only began last year, and I have known them all for many many years outside and inside school. The drastic change screams faking for attention because TikTok told them it was trendy. The other common factor is that they are all DSMP fans, which is also extremely frequent among fakers. Not to mention that when I suggested they speak to the school provided therapist (a genuine certified therapist and very nice man) for free, they’ve said that “doctors don’t know what they’re talking about”.

I desperately wish they would stop disrupting my meetings.",1663555579.0,trauma

I don’t want attention, I’m posting this to hopefully raise awareness. Everyone now a days seems to joke about suicide like it isn’t a big deal and is just whatever. Suicide is very real and very very heart breaking. 

I’m still trying to compose my thoughts and calm down but I can’t. The last 10 hours for me have been absolute hell and full of tears, heart break, mental breakdown and so much more I can’t even describe it. You see those stories on the internet (such as this) about how heart breaking and difficult it is to lose someone to suicide but you never know how it feels until you lose a loved one to suicide. This is the worst pain I’ve ever felt, it’s worse than losing a loved one to a tragic accident imo. knowing that my friend chose to take his life is such a different kind of pain and sorrow. 

Please guys, keep an eye out for the warning signs even things as small as suicidal “jokes”. I wish I noticed the warning signs and paid more attention to them. 

There’s always help for anyone in need of it. Things always get better, taking your life should never be an option on the table

Edit 4: An FAQ of sorts 

Some of you guys are skeptical about my moms reaction, which is completely justified. I'm glad you are, instead of blindly following me, so I'll clear some things up.

Q: Was your uncle on your mother or father's side of the family?
A: he was on my father's side.

Q: Were your mother and uncle close?
A: No, my mother was not close with anyone on my father's side of the family. She hasn't been to a gathering in years, and always blames it on her stomach but I find it hard to believe that every single time we have a reunion (even during Christmas) she has some sort of excuse. She didnt even show up to the funeral 

Q: was your uncle a bad person?
A: absolutely not. He was one of the nicest, kindest people I have ever met. He was recently diagnosed with bipolar, but he was never violent or aggressive like people tend to believe.

Q: was the suicide real?
A: though I have never been directly told, I am almost sure of it. He was diagnosed with bipolar, and was kicked out of his apartment. He spent maybe 6 months or more looking for one, which burned down a couple weeks later. That was the last I heard from him until he died. He had plenty of reasons to end his life, and it answers a lot of questions.

Q:Could she just be laughing because she is grieving?
A: I have seen her grieve before, and I seriously doubt it. Her reaction to my uncle's death was a lot less sincere than other close family members. I understand that some people use humor as a coping mechanism but this time I seriously doubt this is the case.

A quick scroll through my past posts shows how much of a dark place I had been in just a few months ago. 

I have been working on recovery, and despite a few rough patches, I have felt better. I have seen a worthwhile future, and have reclaimed the ability to dream again. 

Despite all of the progress, I still felt like I lacked closure. I needed to close the door. Learn from the past and move on to a happier future. What held me back the most, was the last symbol of power that my depression held over me. My suicide notes. 

I had written several- an unofficial will, a goodbye note to every member of my family, a goodbye note to my friends, and additional thoughts I had. I had written my passwords and instructions on access to my accounts. 

They have spent months, hidden under my bed serving the purpose as a “go bag”. Something that I could just grab before I offed myself. 

Burning my notes into ash was a huge step for me. Suicidal thoughts and depression  often carry a huge lack of energy and a loss of motivation, ironically which can sometimes save your life because pure exhaustion offsets the energy it takes to end it all. Having a prewritten note, or notes for that matter, took away a lot of that energy. So if I ever regressed into that mindset, and snapped, I would be ready. 

Now that the notes are gone, I can live without the thought of a fate I was so certain of looming over me. I can move on. 

I will always have depression- even in my recovery. But I am stronger. I have established leverage. 

I am free. I am happy. I am willing. And I am capable. 

My past doesn’t define me. My actions in the present do. 

I am reclaiming the past. I am reclaiming my brain. 

I am free.


Edit: thank you for all of the kind comments. It means more than you will ever know. I know that in the future, I will have some tough patches but that’s life- but being able to look back at these comments will be a blessing. Thank you all.

For anyone else who is struggling, please get help. I thought I would never see the light of day again, but I broke free. If you are ever in a crisis- text 741-741. They have literally saved my life.

I often feel like just ending it all. Its just no point in anything anymore. I get bullied in school so much. It\`s every single day no matter where I go it's always there, even online. I`ve deleted my Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Simply because I was getting so much harassment. And if that sounded bad. We haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. The f\*cking school hallways. It's a hell on earth, I get shouted at, pushed, grabbed, teased, even hit. They call me ""slut"" ""whore"" ""bitch"" ""ugly"" ""fat"" ""disgusting"" and much more. Really everything you could think of. I`m scared to go to school because I don't know whats going to happen.

Sometimes I go to the library to try and relax a little during lunch breaks. They once ripped my phone out of my hand and said that they were going to smash it. They didn't, but still.

Back when I was 13, I had just switched schools because of bullying. I was trying to start a new life. Everything was going fine. I was dating one of the boys. We were together for about a month until it all went to shit and it has been there to haunt me ever since. I'm 14, almost 15 now. That dickhead guy is now together with one of the other girls. I think that relationship is what really started the firestorm. I

it's usually a group of 3 girls and 2 guys. Everyone can see everything that is happening and they don't do anything. It makes me feel so helpless. They will take any opportunity to take what I say out of context and turn it against me. They will fabricate false stories and spread fake rumors just to make me look bad. They say that I`m really close to my brother, like REALLY close. Wich, I am not. I love my brother, as a fucking brother. And that I have a crush on this one 17-year-old guy, who I bearly even know. I don't understand why they do this to me, I'm not a mean person in any way, actually I'm probably one of the nicest people you'd meet.

There is absolutely no fun in anything anymore. Everything is just an endless struggle. There is no escape from it. I am legally forced to go to school and I cant do anything about it. People think there is so much getting done to prevent it and yes there is a large amount of anti-bullying campaigns, but all they do is make people more aware of the issue, the bullies don't give a shut and they are the once who are the real problem. My parents don't understand and the teachers just overlook it. When I get home from school, I just go to sleep immediately because all I do is cry. Sleeping is the only sort of escape I have. I have switched schools once and there are no other high schools in my area. I'm never going back to that school. I want to end it all. I cant take this anymore. The ONLY reason I havent done it yet is because I dont want to inflict that kind of greif and emotional pain on my family members. Notice how I didnt mention friends, you can probably guess why.

When I hear of someone who jokes about suicide or genuinely talks about it, it takes me back to an old friend group. I met the first online for dnd. I didn’t see his face nor hear his voice for the first few months I knew him. He was self conscious to an extreme. Still one of the nicest and most creative people I’ve ever known. The group was me, him (Pup), and let’s call third guy Jake. 

Jake was just a freshman from a more rural town, liked to skate but never revealed too much about himself. Had a group that always joined our calls though. Liked him cause he was fun.

I always knew Pup had a tough life. His parents were separated but couldn’t afford to live apart. Constant arguments in the background and he took it personally.

The group eventually separated. Not by purpose but things just fell quiet. After a few months of silence I got my old discord account and messaged out to the old group chat.

I learned a thing that day. About a month into the break Pups father died, he was close to his dad and hated his mother. But he (in his view) now had to live with his mother. A few days later he was no longer.

It hit like a truck. He has lived a life I would never want to imagine living in but he had his own future. He was decently smart, made people laugh, and just had a chance.

Moving to Jake, I reconnected with him pretty fast. Not as close as we used to be but we called and played games with the old group occasionally.

2 months later Jake and his friends snuck into a pool at night. Jake stayed after his friends left. He had an unrelated seizure and drowned in the pool alone.


The differences between these two have made me really think about what suicide is. My sister has attempted as well and I’ve never understood. But I also know. I’ve had the thoughts and the urge and the plans.

But I’ve always had something that I want and need to do that reels me in. I can see how that rope can seemingly disappear and sometimes it may genuinely not exist. 

But when losing the opportunity to feel pain you lose the ability to feel all. Pain is powerful but everything good can be hidden waiting to be revealed. And you may never know how much people care.


The question in the title is open ended, I’m genuinely curious on the why and the context behind those who’ve attempted or planned to. If you want to give your own answer to that question please feel free to do so.",1687467256.0,suicide

In true TIFU spirit, this did not happen today, but rather two days ago at 2:30 PM PST.

&#x200B;

My school had a suicide awareness presentation during all of our literature classes. I had my literature class second period, and we went to the auditorium as such, and listened to the presentation they were giving for our period. There is a part of the presentation at the end where they take question slips and answer questions various people have asked anonymously. This information will be important later.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to lunch time. I'm sitting with my friends and I decide to show them my ringtone, because I was setting an alarm. This brings up two big questions.

1. What was my ringtone and why was it worth sharing?
2. Why was I setting an alarm?

Well to answer the first question, my ringtone is cut from a section of [Mine Diamonds](https://youtu.be/dgha9S39Y6M?t=187), specifically the part where our prepubescent singing star of the song starts screaming for no reason. I decided it would be fucking hilarious for me to make it my ringtone, so I did. I usually keep my phone on silent, but this time I didn't, bringing me to the second question.

&#x200B;

I was setting an alarm because I did not have a sixth period after lunch, and I, being the tired high school student I am, I decided I would sleep through it and set an alarm for ten minutes before the end of the period to wake myself up so that I would not be late for seventh period. And the alarm was set to my ringtone.

&#x200B;

Sixth period starts, and I start my siesta. But not for long! My friend who has literature for sixth period asked me if I wanted to go to the presentation with her. I shrugged and I was like ""Why not?""

&#x200B;

I'll tell you why not.

&#x200B;

I forget that my phone is not on silent and we go to the presentation and we get toward the end of the presentation and they start answering questions that people had. Someone had a question about not trusting school counselors and anxiety, something that I was personally curious about, but then it happened. 

&#x200B;

Presenter: ""Just remember that you can always talk to your school counselors an-""

My Fucking Phone: ""aAaaaaAAAaaaaaAAaaAaaaaaaAAAaa""

&#x200B;

My friend next to me sat wide-eyed before crumpling in her seat and dying of laughter because to her it was the funniest fucking thing since animals wearing hot dog costumes. Everyone was looking at me. I was fumbling with my phone, and pushed my thumb into the speaker as hard as I could to muffle the sound as I desperately tried to make it stop. Eventually it did stop but now the damage had been done to my peers. Any sort of dignity or respect I had was now all gone. Fuck. Me.

&#x200B;

Funnily enough the presenters just kept carrying on as if nothing had happened.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I left my phone ringer to its loudest setting during an assembly about suicide, and it ended up blasting ""Mine Diamonds"".",1540402052.0,suicide

I'm living alone for over a month and i'm at verge of losing my mind. I do not have friends in real life and my suicidal thoughts are crawling. I can't really afford food and stuff which makes my life even harder. I won't really go into details and such but i'm guessing saying that alone is enough for imaginating how shit my life is.

A few days ago (or a week? I don't know i cant think straight these days) when i was on my balcony a lady down on the road asked me if i would jump and if i would she gave me a clear spot so people would clean it easier. I thought it was a dark humor joke of some kind but right now i think that lady really tried to help me.

Our country is collapsing and our economy is getting ruined. We have around %100-%150 inflation per month and each day my life becomes harder. Every European country and any other country with a good economy and a good healthcare and stuff is closing their border against us which makes me feel even more i'm in a dead end.

I can't think anything but suicide. I want to go missing and die in a forest, let people find my body a few weeks (or months, or years, or decades) and put me in the unidentified body cases. I want to be unknown. I don't want my family or others to cry after me. I want no one to know me.

Edit : I forgot to add this. My friend died in a motorbike accident. I was thinking to ask her out since both of us really liked each other and it was like ""I'm waiting for him/her to move"" type of relationship. It could be my first love, it could be my first time knowing someone that much. It could be my first person to cuddle with. But she is dead. Dismembered in a motorcycle accident. I saw the video of it. I'm not disgusted or anyrhing i'm just feeling numb. Was it this easy? Was it this meaningless?

TL;DR at the end, I know it's long.)",5,167tj9z,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/167tj9z/i_think_my_friend_mightve_committed_suicide_tw/,7,"Last year, I had a friend on the school bus. I'll call her Vi. 

Vi was in the grade above me. I had no classes with her.

I first noticed her on the school bus last year simply because I thought she looked cool. She had a pixie cut and green dyed hair. She always had the coolest outfits and, what really made me notice her, was her Gravity Falls backpack. I've always loved the show, and it was amazing to see someone with the same interests as me.

One day, the bus was nearly full, so Vi sat next to me. I complimented her backpack, and she immediately started nerding out about Gravity Falls. It was *amazing.* I'd been looking for a friend who loves the show as much as me.

Anyway, that day on, we sat next to each other on the bus every morning. In the evening, I always sat next to my other friend.

Ok, where was I. Oh, Vi. 

Vi, at first glance, seemed like your stereotypical weird dorky kid. She loved to rant about her favorite TV shows and movies. She talked to me about her crush a lot, too. I thought Vi was really awesome.

The more I talked to her, the more it became clear there was something going on in her life. She had apparently been in the psyche ward the first week or so of school which is why she started going to school late. I never asked her why she was in the psyche ward, I didn't want to be rude. Besides, it wasn't my business anyways.

She one day started telling me about some stuff going on with her and her friend in school:

Vi's friend Rose had jokingly called Vi a boy, simply because Vi has short hair and doesn't exactly have the most ""feminine"" body (she's sorta flat-chested). Vi laughed it off, obviously, and Rose did too. The joke should've been over by then, but Rose continued, insisting that Vi ""*prove*"" she's a girl by showing Rose her, erm, *private area*.

And for some reason, Vi didn't decline. 

Vi told me that Rose insisted she meet up with Rose in the locker room after gym class so Rose can get ""proof"" she's a girl.

I don't know why Vi would say yes to this. I told her that it probably wasn't a good idea to meet up with Rose in the locker room like she wanted, but Vi insisted that ""Friends don't let friends down.""

I didn't really know how else to stop her.

One day on the bus ride to school, Vi told me that one of the teachers overheard their conversation. She said that she got three days of in-school-suspension.

I was honestly glad, because I know that Rose was up to no good. I told Vi that maybe it was a good thing her and Rose never got the chance to meet up in the locker room.

But Vi said that she had plans to meet up with her *outside* of school and do it.

Well.

A few days later, again, she said that the school informed her parents of the situation, and they told her that Vi wasn't allowed to be friends with Rose anymore. They made the school change Vi's classes so she didn't have any with Rose.

I think that it was a good thing her parents did that, but Vi was seriously annoyed. It's obvious that she clearly saw Rose as a *friend,* and she *really* thought that Rose just wanted ""*proof*"" Vi was a girl. I didn't want to argue with Vi, in fear of ruining our friendship.

A month or so passes. A week goes by where Vi doesn't go to school.

She comes back one morning, and I ask her if she was sick or something. Why she missed school.

She said that she had been sent to the psyche ward again after her parents found out about her self-harm.

Well, that was new. I didn't know that she did that to herself.

She showed me the spot on her leg where she had been cutting herself. I didn't want to make her feel bad or anything about the fact that she did that to herself, so I tried not to bring attention to it or ask why she did it, even if I knew it was bad for her. I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do.

She said that her parents would be sending her to another school if they caught her hurting herself again, and she didn't want to leave her friends.

Oh, by now, she had developed a crush on Rose. I tried to tell her it wasn't a good idea to stay close to her, but she didn't listen.

She told me some stories about her life at home. Apparently she has two moms: her biological mother, and her wife.

Her biological mother used to have a husband. Apparently he was a huge shitbag and abused Vi, her little siblings, and her mom. Then she divorced him and got remarried to a woman. 

Apparently she was also a shitbag. Among other things, she starved Vi's pet cat to death when Vi was younger. She and Vi's mother got divorced quickly.

Vi's mother remarried one last time to another woman, who actually treats Vi and her family well. Er, that's what Vi said, at least.

The way that Vi described her parents was strange. Instead of trying to understand their hurting child, they berate her for her mental health issues, telling her that ""she has no reason to have these negative feelings"".

Vi also showed clear signs of having an eating disorder. She told me once that she had gone an entire day without eating, and she felt *proud* of herself. She said her goal was three days, but her parents found out she wasn't eating, so they forced her to eat a meal in front of them before she was allowed to leave the house that morning.

And Vi was in no way overweight, she was very skinny. Why she wanted to starve herself, I don't know.

One day, towards the end of the year, she told me that she didn't think she'd be able to make it through the summer. She said that she's had suicidal thoughts before, but never this strong or tempting. 

And I haven't heard of her since school ended.

I go to a different school now, but it's in the same county, so we're able to communicate through the school email. Her parents don't let her have social media, so it was the only way we could talk.

She hasn't messaged me back at all.

I think she might've committed suicide.

Or maybe I'm just an annoying friend who she doesn't want to talk to anymore. I hope that's the case.

But, my other friend who rode the bus with me, I'm still in contact with. He told me that he hasn't seen Vi on the bus since school started up again.

Maybe her parents sent her to another school like they threatened to.

I don't know. But I can't stop thinking about her.

\*\*\*

I’m a homeschooled 15M and I’ve been struggling with thoughts killing myself as of late because of a one main reason.


I believe that true happiness for me lies in the hands of a significant other, or at least, a very close best friend. I don’t think that I’ll ever amount to anything special or meaningful career-wise, and I also struggle to think of a career that would make me truly happy.


Basically, the only way I think I’ll be truly happy as an adult is if I find someone who I love in the strongest way that one can mean the word. 
A perfect person that I can always count on to assure me, just by being themselves and existing in my life, that life is worth living.


This will never happen, finding the person I just described would be statistically impossible. There’s 8 billion people on Earth and even if, by some miracle, that person existed during the same time as me, I would never meet her. The odds are insurmountable.


Even if I was somehow lucky enough to meet that person, I still doubt that I would be able to make her as happy as she would make me. There would always be someone better, someone that would make her happier than I ever could.



Basically, that’s how I feel. I don’t think I’ll ever find love, I don’t think I’ll ever doing anything important career-wise, and I don’t think I’ll ever make anyone else as happy as can be. I guess could still find someone when I go to collage but I doubt that I’ll get lucky enough.


I’m posting this because I want to know if anyone else my age is struggling with these same thoughts, and also to ask the people on here that are older than me if it gets better.

The person was a survivor of sexual assault, and wanted to bring awareness to it in schools and advocacy. In their plan, they wanted to create a club where people can talk comfortably about their experience and have an outlet of support. This club, AFAIK, was never started due to complications with the school.

Guidance counselors and the principal went into the classes the student in question was in on Monday and told them in a brief few minutes. Definitely set the tone for the week. The school remained silent and didn't email parents or notify anyone else outside of the school, causing anger and confusion as people slowly began to find out.

It didn't really accelerate until someone posted on Facebook about it, where it gained nearly 1.4K shares. The school released an email later that night, saying that someone had passed and assemblies would be held on Friday, where topics such as reporting, handling a death, etc would be talked about.

However, the assembly left everyone with an even more sour taste in their mouth, considering the principal talked about how social media was to blame and how we all need to be nicer to each other on social media. They then talked about starting a club for sexual assault awareness, but without any mention of the person's name. In fact, the word ""suicide,"" or the person's name was not mentioned once during the assembly. Essentially, the assembly only kicked the wasp's nest.

I went to the service yesterday, where many of my fellow students and a few teachers attended. It was an emotional time for all, but one thing that stuck out to me was that the principal of their previous school walked up to me, asked if I was okay, and said that if I needed anything, just call or email him. He handed me his card, and I felt more connected to this principal in five minutes than I did in the four years I knew the principal at my school. 

Our school principal did not attend the service.

I may be rambling on at this point, but I'm wondering how everyone else's schools handled situations like this. I don't know if this is just standard for the school to be completely silent, or if my school is *really* that messed up.

TL;DR: someone at my school took their own life, school ignored it mostly until someone posted about it on Facebook, where it gained over a thousand shares, and the school tried holding an assembly, which made it only worse.

I have a transcript I wrote up of the assembly, if anyone would like to read it.

EDIT: https://docdro.id/YuMGilM here is what was said at the assembly.

EDIT EDIT: I feel like I should also provide a bit more background info to this--sophomore year someone had also taken their life and the school did NOT notify parents in any sort of degree. The next day, they handed out flyers for an app that provided support for those in need. Everyone's first thought was, ""wasn't that what guidance counselors are for?"" IIRC they had tried reaching out to the counselors but didn't hear back. Thoughts on this? I want to be open-minded about this as much as possible and hear what others have to say about both situations.",1554048933.0,suicide

I'm in 12th I quit science in 11th and joined commerce. I'm a regular procrastinator since 11th. In 10th I almost topped every exam of science and social science, many were afraid of those two but I was confident 

Quitting science brought me to the lowest self-esteem and courage of topping every test. I procrastinated until I decided to study spcc(subject ) and got 88/100(a month ago)that was something that encouraged me

But I didn't stop procrastinating on things and there are only 7 days left for the paper and I have 6 chapters left.

I finished 2 today. There are 6(five in OC and 1 in economics)more. I don't know how to be productive. I aced my 10th I was able to finish a 200 pages book(revising) in just 1 day but now I can hardly read 4 pages/hour. I cried 3 times today don't know how to be that person I was in 10th. 

I will not kill myself cos ya that's not the solution but I keep feeling like I will...

I tried to talk to my parents and relatives they scolded me.

They told that I didn't study properly the whole year but nobody said ""everything will be alright, don't worry. we're here to help"" except my sister 

There's fucking no way that I'm skipping those chapters because each of then are 20-30 pages.

But I can't do even one page due to Procrastination 
Is that possible to read 60 pages in 5 days?
I got 75/100(10 marks cut because of lack of time, 10 marks cut because of I didn't read 1 chapter and 5 cut because of my mistakes)in economics without finishing those chapters 

My OC's sir advised me to finish those chapters 2 days ago because I wrote a total of 60 marks and got 56/60 and the remaining 40 marks portion remained unattended because I didn't read those chapters 

My OC's exam is at 20th March an Economics's exam is at 17th March

I don’t want attention, I’m posting this to hopefully raise awareness. Everyone now a days seems to joke about suicide like it isn’t a big deal and is just whatever. Suicide is very real and very very heart breaking. 

I’m still trying to compose my thoughts and calm down but I can’t. The last 10 hours for me have been absolute hell and full of tears, heart break, mental breakdown and so much more I can’t even describe it. You see those stories on the internet (such as this) about how heart breaking and difficult it is to lose someone to suicide but you never know how it feels until you lose a loved one to suicide. This is the worst pain I’ve ever felt, it’s worse than losing a loved one to a tragic accident imo. knowing that my friend chose to take his life is such a different kind of pain and sorrow. 

Please guys, keep an eye out for the warning signs even things as small as suicidal “jokes”. I wish I noticed the warning signs and paid more attention to them. 

There’s always help for anyone in need of it. Things always get better, taking your life should never be an option on the table 

I miss my friend so much and I know god has a good angel up there with him.

This is fucking disgusting. I cant believe I live with this woman. I had no idea it was a suicide so the fact that she has the audacity to joke about it is so fucked up.

Edit 3: the are some frequent questions/misconceptions than keep arising. I'm going to answer these when I get the chance in another update.

Edit 4: An FAQ of sorts 

Some of you guys are skeptical about my moms reaction, which is completely justified. I'm glad you are, instead of blindly following me, so I'll clear some things up.

Q: Was your uncle on your mother or father's side of the family?
A: he was on my father's side.

Q: Were your mother and uncle close?
A: No, my mother was not close with anyone on my father's side of the family. She hasn't been to a gathering in years, and always blames it on her stomach but I find it hard to believe that every single time we have a reunion (even during Christmas) she has some sort of excuse. She didnt even show up to the funeral 

Q: was your uncle a bad person?
A: absolutely not. He was one of the nicest, kindest people I have ever met. He was recently diagnosed with bipolar, but he was never violent or aggressive like people tend to believe.

Q: was the suicide real?
A: though I have never been directly told, I am almost sure of it. He was diagnosed with bipolar, and was kicked out of his apartment. He spent maybe 6 months or more looking for one, which burned down a couple weeks later. That was the last I heard from him until he died. He had plenty of reasons to end his life, and it answers a lot of questions.

Q:Could she just be laughing because she is grieving?
A: I have seen her grieve before, and I seriously doubt it. Her reaction to my uncle's death was a lot less sincere than other close family members. I understand that some people use humor as a coping mechanism but this time I seriously doubt this is the case.

I left for college a few weeks ago and subsequently fell out of touch with people I wasn't as close with. That's fine, it happens, but then I got news that one of those people killed herself a couple of days ago. She was the kindest and most selfless person I knew. I don't know anyone with a single bad thing to say about her. But sometimes that doesn't matter. Depression doesn't care about how people really feel about you. 

Please take this as a reminder to reach out to people and ask how they're doing. Some people, like my friend, never show any signs of being depressed or suicidal until it's too late. I can't help but think what would have been different if I and others stayed in touch with her. Now I'm 8 hours from home with no way to attend the funeral.

Cut short to February, pandemic slowed and schools reopened. She finally met more friends but inspite of that, her grades didn't improve in the pre-boards. She told me the day before that she was slapped by her mother for those poor grades and that she could not improve. 

Yesterday night, around 1 AM, i heard about her death. Her parents told that she slipped from the balcony but I knew that she committed suicide.

A quick scroll through my past posts shows how much of a dark place I had been in just a few months ago. 

I have been working on recovery, and despite a few rough patches, I have felt better. I have seen a worthwhile future, and have reclaimed the ability to dream again. 

Despite all of the progress, I still felt like I lacked closure. I needed to close the door. Learn from the past and move on to a happier future. What held me back the most, was the last symbol of power that my depression held over me. My suicide notes. 

I had written several- an unofficial will, a goodbye note to every member of my family, a goodbye note to my friends, and additional thoughts I had. I had written my passwords and instructions on access to my accounts. 

They have spent months, hidden under my bed serving the purpose as a “go bag”. Something that I could just grab before I offed myself. 

Burning my notes into ash was a huge step for me. Suicidal thoughts and depression  often carry a huge lack of energy and a loss of motivation, ironically which can sometimes save your life because pure exhaustion offsets the energy it takes to end it all. Having a prewritten note, or notes for that matter, took away a lot of that energy. So if I ever regressed into that mindset, and snapped, I would be ready. 

Now that the notes are gone, I can live without the thought of a fate I was so certain of looming over me. I can move on. 

I will always have depression- even in my recovery. But I am stronger. I have established leverage. 

I am free. I am happy. I am willing. And I am capable. 

My past doesn’t define me. My actions in the present do. 

I am reclaiming the past. I am reclaiming my brain. 

I am free.


Edit: thank you for all of the kind comments. It means more than you will ever know. I know that in the future, I will have some tough patches but that’s life- but being able to look back at these comments will be a blessing. Thank you all.

I often feel like just ending it all. Its just no point in anything anymore. I get bullied in school so much. It\`s every single day no matter where I go it's always there, even online. I`ve deleted my Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Simply because I was getting so much harassment. And if that sounded bad. We haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. The f\*cking school hallways. It's a hell on earth, I get shouted at, pushed, grabbed, teased, even hit. They call me ""slut"" ""whore"" ""bitch"" ""ugly"" ""fat"" ""disgusting"" and much more. Really everything you could think of. I`m scared to go to school because I don't know whats going to happen.

Sometimes I go to the library to try and relax a little during lunch breaks. They once ripped my phone out of my hand and said that they were going to smash it. They didn't, but still.

Back when I was 13, I had just switched schools because of bullying. I was trying to start a new life. Everything was going fine. I was dating one of the boys. We were together for about a month until it all went to shit and it has been there to haunt me ever since. I'm 14, almost 15 now. That dickhead guy is now together with one of the other girls. I think that relationship is what really started the firestorm. I

it's usually a group of 3 girls and 2 guys. Everyone can see everything that is happening and they don't do anything. It makes me feel so helpless. They will take any opportunity to take what I say out of context and turn it against me. They will fabricate false stories and spread fake rumors just to make me look bad. They say that I`m really close to my brother, like REALLY close. Wich, I am not. I love my brother, as a fucking brother. And that I have a crush on this one 17-year-old guy, who I bearly even know. I don't understand why they do this to me, I'm not a mean person in any way, actually I'm probably one of the nicest people you'd meet.

There is absolutely no fun in anything anymore. Everything is just an endless struggle. There is no escape from it. I am legally forced to go to school and I cant do anything about it. People think there is so much getting done to prevent it and yes there is a large amount of anti-bullying campaigns, but all they do is make people more aware of the issue, the bullies don't give a shut and they are the once who are the real problem. My parents don't understand and the teachers just overlook it. When I get home from school, I just go to sleep immediately because all I do is cry. Sleeping is the only sort of escape I have. I have switched schools once and there are no other high schools in my area. I'm never going back to that school. I want to end it all. I cant take this anymore. The ONLY reason I havent done it yet is because I dont want to inflict that kind of greif and emotional pain on my family members. Notice how I didnt mention friends, you can probably guess why.

I'm living alone for over a month and i'm at verge of losing my mind. I do not have friends in real life and my suicidal thoughts are crawling. I can't really afford food and stuff which makes my life even harder. I won't really go into details and such but i'm guessing saying that alone is enough for imaginating how shit my life is.

A few days ago (or a week? I don't know i cant think straight these days) when i was on my balcony a lady down on the road asked me if i would jump and if i would she gave me a clear spot so people would clean it easier. I thought it was a dark humor joke of some kind but right now i think that lady really tried to help me.

Our country is collapsing and our economy is getting ruined. We have around %100-%150 inflation per month and each day my life becomes harder. Every European country and any other country with a good economy and a good healthcare and stuff is closing their border against us which makes me feel even more i'm in a dead end.

I can't think anything but suicide. I want to go missing and die in a forest, let people find my body a few weeks (or months, or years, or decades) and put me in the unidentified body cases. I want to be unknown. I don't want my family or others to cry after me. I want no one to know me.

Edit : I forgot to add this. My friend died in a motorbike accident. I was thinking to ask her out since both of us really liked each other and it was like ""I'm waiting for him/her to move"" type of relationship. It could be my first love, it could be my first time knowing someone that much. It could be my first person to cuddle with. But she is dead. Dismembered in a motorcycle accident. I saw the video of it. I'm not disgusted or anyrhing i'm just feeling numb. Was it this easy? Was it this meaningless?

Thank you so much for reading all this. Any help?

I’m a homeschooled 15M and I’ve been struggling with thoughts killing myself as of late because of a one main reason.


I believe that true happiness for me lies in the hands of a significant other, or at least, a very close best friend. I don’t think that I’ll ever amount to anything special or meaningful career-wise, and I also struggle to think of a career that would make me truly happy.


Basically, the only way I think I’ll be truly happy as an adult is if I find someone who I love in the strongest way that one can mean the word. 
A perfect person that I can always count on to assure me, just by being themselves and existing in my life, that life is worth living.


This will never happen, finding the person I just described would be statistically impossible. There’s 8 billion people on Earth and even if, by some miracle, that person existed during the same time as me, I would never meet her. The odds are insurmountable.


Even if I was somehow lucky enough to meet that person, I still doubt that I would be able to make her as happy as she would make me. There would always be someone better, someone that would make her happier than I ever could.



Basically, that’s how I feel. I don’t think I’ll ever find love, I don’t think I’ll ever doing anything important career-wise, and I don’t think I’ll ever make anyone else as happy as can be. I guess could still find someone when I go to collage but I doubt that I’ll get lucky enough.


I’m posting this because I want to know if anyone else my age is struggling with these same thoughts, and also to ask the people on here that are older than me if it gets better.


I know this is a hell of a lot of text but I want to sincerely thank anyone who read it all the way through, from the bottom of my heart.

I'm in 12th I quit science in 11th and joined commerce. I'm a regular procrastinator since 11th. In 10th I almost topped every exam of science and social science, many were afraid of those two but I was confident 

Quitting science brought me to the lowest self-esteem and courage of topping every test. I procrastinated until I decided to study spcc(subject ) and got 88/100(a month ago)that was something that encouraged me

But I didn't stop procrastinating on things and there are only 7 days left for the paper and I have 6 chapters left.

I finished 2 today. There are 6(five in OC and 1 in economics)more. I don't know how to be productive. I aced my 10th I was able to finish a 200 pages book(revising) in just 1 day but now I can hardly read 4 pages/hour. I cried 3 times today don't know how to be that person I was in 10th. 

I will not kill myself cos ya that's not the solution but I keep feeling like I will...

I tried to talk to my parents and relatives they scolded me.

They told that I didn't study properly the whole year but nobody said ""everything will be alright, don't worry. we're here to help"" except my sister 

There's fucking no way that I'm skipping those chapters because each of then are 20-30 pages.

But I can't do even one page due to Procrastination 
Is that possible to read 60 pages in 5 days?
I got 75/100(10 marks cut because of lack of time, 10 marks cut because of I didn't read 1 chapter and 5 cut because of my mistakes)in economics without finishing those chapters 

My OC's sir advised me to finish those chapters 2 days ago because I wrote a total of 60 marks and got 56/60 and the remaining 40 marks portion remained unattended because I didn't read those chapters

Big mistake.

It's been a year now. It's really just a matter of time until i have completly lost my shit

I'm trying to build my way up to financial success on YouTube to then drop out.

But everyday I wake up to the loophole that is my life and ask myself ""Why did I go into college?""

Family pressure.

Mom tells me ""Go to college, go to uni, study, get a job""

I don't want a corp. job.

it's not for me. Even tho I love, support and adore those whom go in that direction, it isn't for me.

But if i am, i guess i'll just lift weights everday, that will surely help. (/s if you are braindead.)

I don't even have the energy to be nice, so i end up acting like a jerk even if i don't want to.

I just want to die. If i had the option to die in my sleep today, i would take it.

I just want to be happy. 

It's just not fair... Everyone else is so happy and satisfied, why can't I just be happy?

In case you don't get it, i really want to die. I just have to find a painless method.

and I’m tired too, i just dont want to go through all of this stuff anymore.

I don't even know whether I’m typing coherent sentences anymore, i'm just mindlessly writing down my emotions, for someone, anyone, to see.

I just want to not have an existential crisis every second. 

The only reason i'm not going insane is video games, and it barely numbs the pain anymore.

i actually had a existential crisis while playing hollow knight, you can't even make this up.

My parents never seem to care, and i dont want them to know anyway, id just get punished.

i dont even know what else to say.

If any of you make this into a copypasta, i will actually jump off a roof.

Last night while me and my girlfriend were in a call she forgot to mute herself and i got to hear the whole conversation between her parents over her pet rabbit (which she bought, raised, fed, and cleaned). Apprently when her dad (who recently lost his job at work) came back home found pee on the floor and was absolutely infuriated and screamed at the whole house. 

The pet rabbit named Pochita who was supposed to be in a cage that evening escaped because my GF's little sister played with him and didn't bring him back inside the cage. During the argument i heard my GF scream and beg not to hurt Pochita and the fact that the mom just sided with the Dad didnt help the current situation. I was so worried that i cant even do anything, not even go to her house because the rain was incredibly strong last night.

After the fight, my GF came back on call and cried telling me she had been hit im the back with a hammer but she was thankful it was just light hits.  I tried calling for help but she threatened me she'll off herself if the police get involved or any person at all. 

But physical pain doesnt boyher her that the fact the Dad said he'll kill the only emotional support animal of my GF if he comes back from work. I genuinely hope he was bluffing about thaf because my GF really, REALLY depends on that rabbit over me, which its alright because im aware human relationships are meant to be broken but i still sticked with her because i love her. 

During our talk she was sobbing on where she would safely place Pochita tomorrow and i offered her to let him stay in my house but i really needed my moms permission. We were really hoping that my mom would understand and let Pochita stay here for 4-5 days. But in the morning i talked to mom she was irritated about the idea and didnt want to let him stay for a few days. Me and my mom had to have a quick argument about it, and although her reasoning is good i alsp nust wished she didnt include the sentence of ""Her being a bad influence"" on me. She literally taught me a lot of useful things during our late night talks, mostly about business tactics, which is relavant to my situation at the moment too. 

Anyways this afternoon my GF gave pochita to her school janitor for the time being and until now shes suicidal and depressed on why life is so unfair to her. 

I felt so fucking useless if only mom agreed to let Pochita stay for a few days. 

At the moment i am talking to her while i type this post and she is at work.

instead of giving me medication soon to somewhat ease the physical issues (e.g shaking/ tremors, becoming very sick with anxiety, my heart speeding up, sweating, panic attacks) and help me somewhat control the mental health side, the only thing they could tell my mum is to take me to A&E if she can't control me/ if i get too much on my mental crashes and to lock away the cleaning supplies.

When I hear of someone who jokes about suicide or genuinely talks about it, it takes me back to an old friend group. I met the first online for dnd. I didn’t see his face nor hear his voice for the first few months I knew him. He was self conscious to an extreme. Still one of the nicest and most creative people I’ve ever known. The group was me, him (Pup), and let’s call third guy Jake. 

Jake was just a freshman from a more rural town, liked to skate but never revealed too much about himself. Had a group that always joined our calls though. Liked him cause he was fun.

I always knew Pup had a tough life. His parents were separated but couldn’t afford to live apart. Constant arguments in the background and he took it personally.

The group eventually separated. Not by purpose but things just fell quiet. After a few months of silence I got my old discord account and messaged out to the old group chat.

I learned a thing that day. About a month into the break Pups father died, he was close to his dad and hated his mother. But he (in his view) now had to live with his mother. A few days later he was no longer.

It hit like a truck. He has lived a life I would never want to imagine living in but he had his own future. He was decently smart, made people laugh, and just had a chance.

Moving to Jake, I reconnected with him pretty fast. Not as close as we used to be but we called and played games with the old group occasionally.

2 months later Jake and his friends snuck into a pool at night. Jake stayed after his friends left. He had an unrelated seizure and drowned in the pool alone.


The differences between these two have made me really think about what suicide is. My sister has attempted as well and I’ve never understood. But I also know. I’ve had the thoughts and the urge and the plans.

But I’ve always had something that I want and need to do that reels me in. I can see how that rope can seemingly disappear and sometimes it may genuinely not exist. 

But when losing the opportunity to feel pain you lose the ability to feel all. Pain is powerful but everything good can be hidden waiting to be revealed. And you may never know how much people care.


The question in the title is open ended, I’m genuinely curious on the why and the context behind those who’ve attempted or planned to. If you want to give your own answer to that question please feel free to do so.",1687467256.0,suicidal

 HOWEVER things are getting better! Ever since antidessants started working it's been working wonders. I can't thank for getting better only the meds though but also supportive friends and family and time that passed. 
 What I am trying to say is that life is really hard sometimes and you may feel hopeless. But it won't last forever, and supporting friends, family hell even meds can help. Don't be afraid to reach out for help, you will not regret it believe me. And whatever you may be going through now will eventually pass, maybe not entirely but enough that you will be able to enjoy life again. You will be also left with a valuable life lesson.

In true TIFU spirit, this did not happen today, but rather two days ago at 2:30 PM PST.

&#x200B;

My school had a suicide awareness presentation during all of our literature classes. I had my literature class second period, and we went to the auditorium as such, and listened to the presentation they were giving for our period. There is a part of the presentation at the end where they take question slips and answer questions various people have asked anonymously. This information will be important later.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to lunch time. I'm sitting with my friends and I decide to show them my ringtone, because I was setting an alarm. This brings up two big questions.

1. What was my ringtone and why was it worth sharing?
2. Why was I setting an alarm?

Well to answer the first question, my ringtone is cut from a section of [Mine Diamonds](https://youtu.be/dgha9S39Y6M?t=187), specifically the part where our prepubescent singing star of the song starts screaming for no reason. I decided it would be fucking hilarious for me to make it my ringtone, so I did. I usually keep my phone on silent, but this time I didn't, bringing me to the second question.

&#x200B;

I was setting an alarm because I did not have a sixth period after lunch, and I, being the tired high school student I am, I decided I would sleep through it and set an alarm for ten minutes before the end of the period to wake myself up so that I would not be late for seventh period. And the alarm was set to my ringtone.

&#x200B;

Sixth period starts, and I start my siesta. But not for long! My friend who has literature for sixth period asked me if I wanted to go to the presentation with her. I shrugged and I was like ""Why not?""

&#x200B;

I'll tell you why not.

&#x200B;

I forget that my phone is not on silent and we go to the presentation and we get toward the end of the presentation and they start answering questions that people had. Someone had a question about not trusting school counselors and anxiety, something that I was personally curious about, but then it happened. 

&#x200B;

Presenter: ""Just remember that you can always talk to your school counselors an-""

My Fucking Phone: ""aAaaaaAAAaaaaaAAaaAaaaaaaAAAaa""

&#x200B;

My friend next to me sat wide-eyed before crumpling in her seat and dying of laughter because to her it was the funniest fucking thing since animals wearing hot dog costumes. Everyone was looking at me. I was fumbling with my phone, and pushed my thumb into the speaker as hard as I could to muffle the sound as I desperately tried to make it stop. Eventually it did stop but now the damage had been done to my peers. Any sort of dignity or respect I had was now all gone. Fuck. Me.

&#x200B;

Funnily enough the presenters just kept carrying on as if nothing had happened.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I left my phone ringer to its loudest setting during an assembly about suicide, and it ended up blasting ""Mine Diamonds"".",1540402052.0,suicidal

I experienced the most unsettling thing today. 

Usually I'm just sad, getting Suicidal thoughts during my episodes, but today weren't just thoughts..
I imagined what I would have to do to stab my under chin and rip my jaw from it, all of it very very detailed. It had no pain, fortunately.. but I felt scared and as soon as this ""scene"" ended.  For a bit it felt like it was real, that I was actually doing  it, only half way I realized it was just  imagination.
My heart is still pounding,  do any of you know what the fuck is this? Or why the fuck?

~~E: anyone commenting, Reddit isn't letting me see new comments, hopefully it's fixed by tomorrow in which case I will read your comments.~~

~~Also if you're actually depressed, talk to someone, see a therapist, if you have the same bad luck I did and can't see a therapist for whatever reason I'm happy to talk to at least be there for you and listen.~~

~~E2: Okay since I'm about to go to sleep I'll clear up what I am talking about a bit. When someone fakes depression for attention and just treats it like a quirky personality trait, or treats just being sad for something that happened as being suicidal, it screws everyone else over. When someone else fakes depression it can make a depressed person wonder weather they are faking it, and it can make others think they are faking it because so many people fake it. You're attention whoring and overreacting hurts people who are actually struggling and prevents them from seeking help because they are afraid they won't be taken seriously, as if it wasn't hard enough to talk about depression in the first place.~~

Honestly disregard the entire post, if you relate to sad Bart relate to sad Bart, if you cope by sharing dramatic stuff cope like that, but get help and talk it out to someone who will take you seriously, just don't suffer in silence.",1562447247.0,depression

Here's my advice to you.",25199,aac0qw,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/aac0qw/soon_i_will_be_turning_20_in_my_teenage_years_i/,1034,"Hi everyone. My name is Maya and I'm about to turn 20 years old. It feels weird to be posting here for probably the last time -- you may not recognize me but I joined this subreddit when I was 14. In the intervening 6 years, I've dropped out of school twice, gotten my heart broken countless times, spent time in a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt, moved across the country 4 times, and dealt with drug addiction and teen pregnancy. I know that sounds like a lot, but right now I am 1.5 years clean, I live with my boyfriend of 1 year and our cat, I have a full-time job, a good circle of friends, and I couldn't be happier. If anyone can show you that no matter what shit goes down, you can turn it around, it's me. So here's my advice:

*  **Stop giving a fuck about what you look like.**  This has been my biggest personal change since high school. I used to spend HOURS in front of the mirror, worrying about a pimple the size of a pinhead. No one else is noticing that shit, I promise.
* **Reach out to your friends with mental illness.** Even if they never want to hang out, keep inviting them, They always say ""if you're struggling, reach out!"", but it should be the other way around as well. Check on your friends. 
*  **Condoms alone are not effective birth control.**
* **Ask for what you want.** Whether it's a promotion at your job or a date with the girl you like, you have to start asking for things. Point A is where you are now. Point B is where you want to be. The worst thing that happens if what you ask for gets turned down is you stay at Point A. 
* **Be kind to your teachers.**
* **Know the signs of an abusive relationship.** [https://au.reachout.com/articles/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship](https://au.reachout.com/articles/signs-of-an-abusive-relationship)
* **There is no age where you are required to have your life plan figured out.**
* **Always wear a helmet and close-toed shoes when riding a moped/motorcycle.**
* **Do not fucking ever do heroin.** Even if you think you won't get addicted. Even if your friends are supervising you. Even if you snort it. Do not do it.
* **If the only reason you won't do something is that you're afraid, do it.** Except for heroin lol. 
* **You will grow apart from your friends.** This is ok and nobody's fault.
*  **Don't worry too much about comparing your life to other people's.** And don't let it make you bitter. Congratulate them on their successes, and don't worry about how your accomplishments stack up next to theirs. 

and lastly,

* **Let yourself be young.** Put the right amount of pressure on yourself to succeed, but don't lose out on the years of your life where you have little to no responsibility and loads of free time! This is a time you will never get back, so make sure you're spending it doing stuff you enjoy. How you spend your days is how you spend your life. ",1546016346.0,depression

1. We would miss you.
2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.

&#x200B;

* smile - smiling makes you more approachable, makes people nicer to you, and is scientifically proven to make you feel a bit better
* achieve things - you need purpose in life. without one, you drift and do dumb things. never be ashamed to try for something. my best tip to achieve things and become better is to do what you are bad at and make it a habit. read ""talent is overrated"". 
* try **harder and longer** \- things take time. in the gym, you either need to push to your limits with heavy weights or do cardio to become fit. you won't make friends without trying either, and I learned that the hard way.
* self-improvement content - I will never convince you to leave social media, but since you need it, make sure what you consume is good - it's the same way with food.
*  have a good routine/take care of yourself - this is simply essential. go outside, drink water, do sports.
* listen to people with experience - if you want to get rich, learn from rich people. if you want to be fit, learn from fit people. you can be successful without being special.
* live a little - do dumb things, but only for fun and without crazy consequences. like betting 20$ on a basketball game.
* make small goals - you need things to be proud of
* embrace who you are - do not, under any circumstances tell yourself you are something or someone you are not.
* have friends - humans are social creatures, and being alone with fuck you up big time.
* change the world around you - do not be pushed around. if you want something, go fucking get it.
* get off Reddit -you know why
* no rubbing yourself - it destroys your drive - think about it. your only goal in life as an evolutionary species is to reproduce, and if your natural system thinks you've done so, you won't feel the need to go for anything else. search it up. 
* be masculine or be feminine - it's only natural",1682696378.0,depression

And while I also have issues myself, I’m not nearly as bad off as them, so becoming the primary caretaker, their problems brought me down into the same slump. And idk what happened at the end of this school year but I decided I didn’t wanna live like that anymore, so I joined colorguard, got tickets to a concert in July, started to learn makeup for fun, and cleaned my room

While things are still rough, and I’m still caring for them. I’m done pretending to be strong and I’m getting my life together to actually be strong :D

TL:DR- I got a sick family and I’m the main caretaker. I have my issues too and being the “strong one” put me in the same slump they are. But suddenly I decided to get my life together and clean my room

This happened a few month ago. For the whole month, every single day without resting I cried multiple times each day. Some nights I would have a mental breakdown and like throwing stuff while crying and screaming and I felt extremely depressed. 

Every single day I constantly wanted to die, cry and not want to do anything at all the whole day. Does this count as depression? I got kind of better after a month. But now I’m starting to feel it again. And I thought it was just mood swings but I just continue feeling depressed  everyday. If so, I have no idea why I’m depressed. Is this possible? Was I depressed a month ago?

I’m feeling depressed and the feeling that I want to end everything recently. I thought it was just mood swings and I thought I would be better and get over the next day and I’m not.

I always thought i was a happy person who could handle their emotions and take things with a level head. Now all I feel is pain on a daily basis. I hate myself and my life. My self worth has plummeted into the fucking negatives, and it feels like I’m stuck with nowhere to go.

I’ve been going to the gym because I feel like maybe I’ll be worth it to other people. I know that I need serious help and I desperately want help. I want to speak with a therapist.

My mom tells me that she doesn’t want to pay for therapy when I told her that I think I need it. She says that I should just talk to her about it. I really love my mom but it just doesn’t seem like she understands what I mean when I’m talking to her. I couldn’t even think of asking my dad about it. The honest truth is I need to talk to somebody who knows how to navigate these feelings of grief and abandonment. I’ve even started taking psychology classes to try to help myself understand why I feel this way. I want nothing else but to find some motivation and to be able to look forward to my future like I used to. I see nothing ahead for me anymore.

This person is in such a bad place that they would rather KILL THEMSELVES than continue living like they are. You have to be in a really bad place to believe that's a good option. It's not selfish.

People don't commit suicide because it's something they're looking forward to, it's because it seems better than staying where they are.

“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”

Also, telling depressed people that there is probably someone out there who cares about them isn't that great of a help either. You don't know their life. Maybe they really don't have anyone. And if they do, depression can stop them from seeing that. And even if they can see that, it doesn't make the flames seem any better usually.

I'm suicidal. I know there's people out there who care about me and would be sad if I was gone. It doesn't make my pain any less real though. And in the darkest times of my depression, it really can feel like no one cares.

And I'm not encouraging suicide. There are ways to get help and to help your pain. It's gonna take time and dedication but it is possible. 

But please stop this hurtful rhetoric.",1532298707.0,suicide

Even worse is when you're suicidal - you must find the joys of your existence, with no desire to do so. 

I realized this before I recovered, but I guess now I'm bummed out by it for a different reason. The pit I've crawled out of isn't a pit everyone will climb out of. All we can do is be there for them in case they do find enough strength to carry on.

For those struggling, I'm not going to negotiate with you on the value of human life. To be honest, I still believe nothing truly matters. The difference is, I think that makes it easy to live life giving 0 fucks and having fun.

If you want to take your life, explore all the reasons why or why you may not want to; don't be impulsive. If you see everything good in the world and still want to commit, I've got no problem with that. I also think, though, it's very likely that you'll lose your desire to die with a true exploration of the world around you. Give the world a shot before you leave.

Then again, I'm only seventeen; the world is so much more than what I've gained from it. Maybe suicide is the best option. From what I've seen, though, it's not for me. I hope I helped someone with this.",1687295493.0,depression

Even then they eventually stopped answering, and I thought one of them had killer herself. She didn't, but I had survivors guilt for a while until I learned she hadn't killed herself

Well a little after covid I asked my crush out, but she said no. After a while the guilt started eating me up because I knew a girl liked me, but I liked this different girl. When I eventually remembered her, I had forgotten her name. Eventually I found her name in the year, and that's kept me up for a few nights here and there. Just thinking about what a fucking retard I am(Hopefully one day I'll find my way back to her). During last school year(the one for this summer), I had a new. I asked her out and she said no too. During something I did a few weeks, I found a new girl that I crushed over. For stupid reasons I had to leave early, so I hadn't had enough time to tell her(it was a really fucking stupid reason, but I know it wasn't right. It just felt automatic what I did. Probably because of my abusive sister).

So that brings us to the reason why I'm writing this. I gave my number to a guy I worked with there. I would say we were some what fine friends in the short amount of time I was there. Now stupidly, workers aren't allowed to text each other(however I might add it says nothing about ex-employees or during the off season), and so I text him without response. One thing I text him today was ""To quote a great man ""Let's go get some ass!"""" The reason being it's the off day, and him and his girlfriend usually hangout together(He, his girlfriend, and I actually all worked together). As well as I get a laugh out of it, and I hope he does too. It helps with the depression. The depression being caused by lack of friends(sorta), and that depression forming in the 2nd grade. However I think it started in 1st, and showed itself in 2nd grade(I said I wanted to kill myself in 2nd grade)

Anyways, after I laughed at the funny test I sent. The depression set in, and how I might truly be alone for the rest if my. Sometimes it feels like god(if there is one, and if there is. I'm not impressed with his work) is a sadist for my suffering to not feel alone

Find a job, further your career whatever it may be. Wait till you're 30 then start to think about settling down. Find a partner someone you truly love, get a house or apartment with that person and get married. Have some kids 1 or 2 probably, 3 or more is overkill but it's your life - remeber that. Put your kids through school, have a college fund for them and watch as they grow up for 18 years and be there when they graduate. Move to the countryside, or to a lake house in the woods of Denmark. Live the rest of your days of the land, have a quite, simple life until you get mauled by a bear at the age of 124.

Recently we’ve noticed complaints that the subreddit is “slowly dying” with fewer users being active and although it is highly inevitable at some point, right now, the mod team feels that there are things we can do to keep it “alive” because it’s a great community :) 

Further inquiry with users showed the unfortunate truth, “most people have stopped coming to the sub because it has become depressing to be there. There are the very few who like to help out and stay here as they love it here. But the ones who are not that committed and the ones who come here to forget about what happens in their lives, just get hit with a reality check. Which is not fun for them. And they leave or don't participate” 

We would like to be transparent with our users and ask for your opinion before making any decisions. Although we’ve posted about using other outlets like r/teenagersbutdepressed, the vent channel on our discord, encouraging people to reach out to their friends and even us personally. This however was only effective for a short period of time and at this time we feel we might have to be more strictly enforcing this, removing influxes of suicidal/self-harm related posts here where some members may not be able to cope with the stress and worry that comes with seeing their friends in such distress and instead urging users to use r/teenagersbutdepressed where people who are *capable* of listening and helping will respond. 

“Open to any mental illness or pain, and it’s about being a safe place to discuss mental problems and in turn receive support” 

The same community, the same love, support, understanding, and care but limited to those who can deal with such things right now.

Posting on the r/teenagersbutdepressed, everyone present is available and there for you, you wouldn’t be a burden, annoying or bothering anyone because everyone there wants to help and *can* help.

Your mental health is important, you are important and you are not wrong for posting about it. 

Also encouraging users to dm and talk to people who say that they can be talked to, would like to help and you wouldn’t be bothering them or even talk on the vent channel on our \[discord\]([https://discord./](https://discord./)) 

We feel that this may be in the best interest of the subreddit, sustaining a safe, happy space.

Kindly let us know your thoughts and remember that we care, you matter and you are loved in this community <3

We would like to let the community make a decision on this, so this post  is dedicated to explaining what Asher is and let the community decide  on its fate.

Asher is a bot  designed to automatically reply to posts in teenage subreddits that are  considered to have dark thoughts about suicide. Then, Asher places a  comment and gives some advice for the person, depending on the  situation.

Sometimes it'll  recommend having someone to talk to, sometimes it'll recommend coping  mechanisms, sometimes it'll recommend something else - it is dynamic  based on what your post contains.

This  will not interrupt Quinn's progress, even though Asher and Quinn share  an account. So, dearest community, what do you think? I'll be awaiting  your response!

The Asher Suicide Prevention bot is under development. If you know Python and PRAW, you can directly contribute to it's development! If not, don't fear - we have a survey you can fill out of things that will help us make Asher as dynamic as possible!

For those who don't know, Asher is designed to help depressed/suicidal people by giving valuable advice. The advice is picked off a list of advice, ensuring that Asher isn't just repeating themselves, and the advice is also dynamic based on what the user said. 

For example,  if the user says they are suicidal, then Asher will give advice based on that. If the user is depressed, Asher won't give the same advice to them. Now, if the person is self-harming, Asher will give entirely separate advice. Going through a breakup? Asher's got you! It's dynamic based on what you post and is designed to help you through those rough times we all know so well.

I've been trying to talk to her for hours now but she's not replying to my messages. I'm just freaking out so much. She messaged me at 1am last night that she had taken all the pills in her house. I saw the message at 5pm.

We usually talk late at nights at that time coz we both have insomnia. But dumbass me decided to sleep yesterday night. If only I would've stayed awake, if only I was there for her when she needed me the most, if only I would've showed her love and support and let her know that she was not alone, then maybe this all wouldn't have happened.

She was always there for me. She was there when I tried to kill myself even when nobody else was there. She said that she'd always be with me. Why did she leave me then?! Why did she leave me all alone?!

I really hope she's still here. It really pains me that I can't be there to give her a huge hug and let her know that she's not alone. We'd always said that we'd stick together and be there for each other.

But I failed her. I wasn't there for her when she needed me the most. I can't stop blaming myself. If only I could've done more, then maybe she'd still be here with us, with me. But I can't lose hope just yet. She *is* with me. She *has* to be alive. Idk what I'd do without her. I don't want her to be all alone wherever she is. I just wanna be with her and tell her that it's all gonna be alright.

Idk what I was to her but she is the only true friend I ever have. She made me feel comfortable. I loved making her laugh with my corny jokes. But now I probably won't be able to do that. She made me promise that we'd go to Korea together someday (she's a BTS stan). And it pains me that I may not be able to fullfill my promise.

She was the sweetest person I ever knew. She writes really great romance fiction and I just live her sense of humor. I really wanted to meet her irl someday. 

I can't stop blaming myself. It should've been me, not her. She didn't deserve this, any of this. It should have been me. I would trade places with her in a heartbeat if I could. My hands keep trembling even as I'm writing this. 

Everyone, if you have read this far, then please check up on your loved ones. Tell them you love them, that they are loved and deserve nothing but the best. Keep them in your hearts and keep close with them. Never let go. And please pray for her if you can.",1634053077.0,suicide

The  Asher Suicide Prevention bot is under development. If you know Python  and PRAW, you can directly contribute to it's development! If not, don't  fear - we have a survey you can fill out of things that will help us  make Asher as dynamic as possible!

For  those who don't know, Asher is designed to help depressed/suicidal  people by giving valuable advice. The advice is picked off a list of  advice, ensuring that Asher isn't just repeating themselves, and the  advice is also dynamic based on what the user said.

For  example,  if the user says they are suicidal, then Asher will give  advice based on that. If the user is depressed, Asher won't give the  same advice to them. Now, if the person is self-harming, Asher will give  entirely separate advice. Going through a breakup? Asher's got you!  It's dynamic based on what you post and is designed to help you through  those rough times we all know so well.

It  is also worth noting that if Asher misreads the situation, going below 0  comment karma will make them remove their comment. This is a feature so  Asher's posts aren't intrusive or annoying to those who aren't  depressed, suicidal, or going through a rough time.

And all of this started because of second according 

He messaged me and we bonded over a similar taste in music and it was like this for the first day we just shared music and talked about our lives 

Then at night on the second day he opened up to me and told me that he couldn't deal with life his family hated him he didn't have any friends and he had nothing to show for his 28 years of life and he told me he was going to kill himself that night he said if he made it through he would messege me in the morning but not to expect anything

I didn't get much sleep that night and just layed in my bed feeling miserable 

The nest morning he apologized and said that he hit a low point and he didn't want to make me to be sad and that he was sorry I forgave him and we continued talking and sharing music but it felt off 


If I have any response like ok he would get upset and would tell me I was hurting him so I would try my best to not do those 


At one point I started talking with another friend and couldn't messege him back immediately 5 minutes later he asked what was going on and told me I was hurting him 

He started getting weird and would make comments about how he couldn't trust me because he didn't know what I looked like and he asked if I would make a social media just to talk with him 

He was persistent on that last one and would tell me that it hurt him that I wouldn't do it and that I was being mean to someone with cancer (he never mentioned that before btw) and eventually I told him I wasn't going to make an account because I don't like socal media all that much and he already had a place to talk and that he was making me uncomfortable


He stopped talking after that and I feared the worst I decided to re read our messages and seeing everything just put in front of me again it scared me so I asked a friend who agreed that it was weird and told me to block him so I did and that was the end of it

1540,,To everyone that feels suicidal today,7,p3tbzk,teenagersbutpog,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagersbutpog/comments/p3tbzk/to_everyone_that_feels_suicidal_today/,6,"You matter. I care about you, the moderators care about you, your friends care about you. It may not always seem like it, but as humans we feel natural grief when we experience the death of someone, especially if you're close. 

If you're suicidal because of the loss of a pet or close friend, this is especially noteworthy. What if your best friend becomes suicidal or even kills themself because of your suicide. 

So please, try to hold on. We all have our ups and downs, our bad moments, our bad decisions. I myself struggle with suicide daily, although its gotten better with therapy and antidepressants. You aren't alone and we care. 

Do two things for me if you're suicidal. Get a piece of paper and write down the names of every person you care about and a good memory of them. Then write down your favorite memory about your favorite game,  restaurant, food, whatever makes you feel slightly happy. The goal is to have a page of things that make you happy, things to live for. Just 3 things can be enough. 

Then I want you to write at the bottom of the page three people you know you can (and preferably **will**) contact when you want to end your life. This can include friends, any hotlines you like, even family. Write down as many ways to contact them that you know of.
This is called a suicide plan. Please use it when you want to commit suicide. Read it, if it doesn't make you happy call the people at the bottom of the page. 

I care about you teenagers, we can get through the bad days, one step at a time <3

however you will also remember your first kiss 

and the first time you listened to your favorite song 

you will also remember the butterfly that landed on you when you were 5

You may be thinking “no one cares about me so if I die no one would be sad”. You’re wrong, there’s a good amount of people that really do care about you and they would be really sad if you were gone, so if you did die you would just be making life worse for them

You also might be thinking that life is too hard for you rn and just not existing would be the best way to solve it. You’re wrong. You can solve pretty much anything of you try hard enough and if you give it some time. 

You’re not a bad person either, and you def don’t deserve to die. Sure you may have done some things considered wrong but that doesn’t mean people hate you and you deserve death.

I care about you, the moderators care about you, your friends care about you. It may not always seem like it, but as humans we feel natural grief when we experience the death of someone, especially if you're close. 

If you're suicidal because of the loss of a pet or close friend, this is especially noteworthy. What if your best friend becomes suicidal or even kills themself because of your suicide. 

So please, try to hold on. We all have our ups and downs, our bad moments, our bad decisions. I myself struggle with suicide daily, although its gotten better with therapy and antidepressants. You aren't alone and we care. 

Do two things for me if you're suicidal. Get a piece of paper and write down the names of every person you care about and a good memory of them. Then write down your favorite memory about your favorite game,  restaurant, food, whatever makes you feel slightly happy. The goal is to have a page of things that make you happy, things to live for. Just 3 things can be enough. 

Then I want you to write at the bottom of the page three people you know you can (and preferably **will**) contact when you want to end your life. This can include friends, any hotlines you like, even family. Write down as many ways to contact them that you know of.
This is called a suicide plan. Please use it when you want to commit suicide. Read it, if it doesn't make you happy call the people at the bottom of the page. 

I care about you teenagers, we can get through the bad days, one step at a time <3

Figure out your hobbies/ interests and meet people who have those same interests. Graduate, go to college/uni get a degree based on those hobbies/interests. Live ur 20s, go out and have fun, party all night with the people closest to you, or travel the world and meet new people, experience the different cultures out world has to offer. Find a job, further your career whatever it may be. Wait till you're 30 then start to think about settling down. Find a partner someone you truly love, get a house or apartment with that person and get married. Have some kids 1 or 2 probably, 3 or more is overkill but it's your life - remeber that. Put your kids through school, have a college fund for them and watch as they grow up for 18 years and be there when they graduate. Move to the countryside, or to a lake house in the woods of Denmark. Live the rest of your days of the land, have a quite, simple life until you get mauled by a bear at the age of 124.

Recently we’ve noticed complaints that the subreddit is “slowly dying” with fewer users being active and although it is highly inevitable at some point, right now, the mod team feels that there are things we can do to keep it “alive” because it’s a great community :) 

Further inquiry with users showed the unfortunate truth, “most people have stopped coming to the sub because it has become depressing to be there. There are the very few who like to help out and stay here as they love it here. But the ones who are not that committed and the ones who come here to forget about what happens in their lives, just get hit with a reality check. Which is not fun for them. And they leave or don't participate” 

We would like to be transparent with our users and ask for your opinion before making any decisions. Although we’ve posted about using other outlets like r/teenagersbutdepressed, the vent channel on our discord, encouraging people to reach out to their friends and even us personally. This however was only effective for a short period of time and at this time we feel we might have to be more strictly enforcing this, removing influxes of suicidal/self-harm related posts here where some members may not be able to cope with the stress and worry that comes with seeing their friends in such distress and instead urging users to use r/teenagersbutdepressed where people who are *capable* of listening and helping will respond. 

“Open to any mental illness or pain, and it’s about being a safe place to discuss mental problems and in turn receive support” 

The same community, the same love, support, understanding, and care but limited to those who can deal with such things right now.

Posting on the r/teenagersbutdepressed, everyone present is available and there for you, you wouldn’t be a burden, annoying or bothering anyone because everyone there wants to help and *can* help.

Your mental health is important, you are important and you are not wrong for posting about it. 

Also encouraging users to dm and talk to people who say that they can be talked to, would like to help and you wouldn’t be bothering them or even talk on the vent channel on our \[discord\]([https://discord./](https://discord./)) 

We feel that this may be in the best interest of the subreddit, sustaining a safe, happy space.

Kindly let us know your thoughts and remember that we care, you matter and you are loved in this community <3

We would like to let the community make a decision on this, so this post  is dedicated to explaining what Asher is and let the community decide  on its fate.

Asher is a bot  designed to automatically reply to posts in teenage subreddits that are  considered to have dark thoughts about suicide. Then, Asher places a  comment and gives some advice for the person, depending on the  situation.

Sometimes it'll  recommend having someone to talk to, sometimes it'll recommend coping  mechanisms, sometimes it'll recommend something else - it is dynamic  based on what your post contains.

This  will not interrupt Quinn's progress, even though Asher and Quinn share  an account. So, dearest community, what do you think? I'll be awaiting  your response!

The Asher Suicide Prevention bot is under development. If you know Python and PRAW, you can directly contribute to it's development! If not, don't fear - we have a survey you can fill out of things that will help us make Asher as dynamic as possible!

For those who don't know, Asher is designed to help depressed/suicidal people by giving valuable advice. The advice is picked off a list of advice, ensuring that Asher isn't just repeating themselves, and the advice is also dynamic based on what the user said. 

For example,  if the user says they are suicidal, then Asher will give advice based on that. If the user is depressed, Asher won't give the same advice to them. Now, if the person is self-harming, Asher will give entirely separate advice. Going through a breakup? Asher's got you! It's dynamic based on what you post and is designed to help you through those rough times we all know so well.  


It is also worth noting that if Asher misreads the situation, going below 0 comment karma will make them remove their comment. This is a feature so Asher's posts aren't intrusive or annoying to those who aren't depressed, suicidal, or going through a rough time.

I've been trying to talk to her for hours now but she's not replying to my messages. I'm just freaking out so much. She messaged me at 1am last night that she had taken all the pills in her house. I saw the message at 5pm.

We usually talk late at nights at that time coz we both have insomnia. But dumbass me decided to sleep yesterday night. If only I would've stayed awake, if only I was there for her when she needed me the most, if only I would've showed her love and support and let her know that she was not alone, then maybe this all wouldn't have happened.

She was always there for me. She was there when I tried to kill myself even when nobody else was there. She said that she'd always be with me. Why did she leave me then?! Why did she leave me all alone?!

I really hope she's still here. It really pains me that I can't be there to give her a huge hug and let her know that she's not alone. We'd always said that we'd stick together and be there for each other.

But I failed her. I wasn't there for her when she needed me the most. I can't stop blaming myself. If only I could've done more, then maybe she'd still be here with us, with me. But I can't lose hope just yet. She *is* with me. She *has* to be alive. Idk what I'd do without her. I don't want her to be all alone wherever she is. I just wanna be with her and tell her that it's all gonna be alright.

Idk what I was to her but she is the only true friend I ever have. She made me feel comfortable. I loved making her laugh with my corny jokes. But now I probably won't be able to do that. She made me promise that we'd go to Korea together someday (she's a BTS stan). And it pains me that I may not be able to fullfill my promise.

She was the sweetest person I ever knew. She writes really great romance fiction and I just live her sense of humor. I really wanted to meet her irl someday. 

I can't stop blaming myself. It should've been me, not her. She didn't deserve this, any of this. It should have been me. I would trade places with her in a heartbeat if I could. My hands keep trembling even as I'm writing this.

And all of this started because of second according 

He messaged me and we bonded over a similar taste in music and it was like this for the first day we just shared music and talked about our lives 

Then at night on the second day he opened up to me and told me that he couldn't deal with life his family hated him he didn't have any friends and he had nothing to show for his 28 years of life and he told me he was going to kill himself that night he said if he made it through he would messege me in the morning but not to expect anything

I didn't get much sleep that night and just layed in my bed feeling miserable 

The nest morning he apologized and said that he hit a low point and he didn't want to make me to be sad and that he was sorry I forgave him and we continued talking and sharing music but it felt off 


If I have any response like ok he would get upset and would tell me I was hurting him so I would try my best to not do those 


At one point I started talking with another friend and couldn't messege him back immediately 5 minutes later he asked what was going on and told me I was hurting him 

He started getting weird and would make comments about how he couldn't trust me because he didn't know what I looked like and he asked if I would make a social media just to talk with him 

He was persistent on that last one and would tell me that it hurt him that I wouldn't do it and that I was being mean to someone with cancer (he never mentioned that before btw) and eventually I told him I wasn't going to make an account because I don't like socal media all that much and he already had a place to talk and that he was making me uncomfortable


He stopped talking after that and I feared the worst I decided to re read our messages and seeing everything just put in front of me again it scared me so I asked a friend who agreed that it was weird and told me to block him so I did and that was the end of it 



Until a few days ago when I watched a video on an abusive relationship and what the guy did in that video was too similar to what second did to be a coincidence what they did and how they did it was almost identical

Just look at some of the lyrics in this fucking thing: “cut off the arms, cut off the legs, cut off the head, get rid of the body. Get rid of the body”. “I keep my mouth shut, I know my place, I know my place, I hide my stink, I need you more than I hate myself”. “you hurt me then you hate yourself, you hurt me and you hurt yourself” “get into your bed, your flesh is easy, your flesh is easy, flesh is easy to shape” “you’re superior, I don’t exist, you control me, you’re corrupt, you’re deformed, you’re deformed, you’re deformed” “nothing beats them like a cop with a club, nothing rapes them like a cop with his club” “some people wanna kill you, some people wanna fuck you, when you say the wrong word when you do the wrong thing, you could be screwing yourself” “the only real thing is misery, submission means you get murdered” “when you eat your pain you keep your nerve, when you hid your fear you degrade yourself” 


Do you see what I mean by this album is  a horrific, devastating, ugly, beaten and bruised masterpiece. Do yourself a favour and go listen to this album   It’s sludgy textures as unrelenting heaviness completely overwhelmed me in my first listen but by my 5th I knew that this album was amazing and a complete representation of crushing hopelessness and despair

Even then they eventually stopped answering, and I thought one of them had killer herself. She didn't, but I had survivors guilt for a while until I learned she hadn't killed herself

Well a little after covid I asked my crush out, but she said no. After a while the guilt started eating me up because I knew a girl liked me, but I liked this different girl. When I eventually remembered her, I had forgotten her name. Eventually I found her name in the year, and that's kept me up for a few nights here and there. Just thinking about what a fucking retard I am(Hopefully one day I'll find my way back to her). During last school year(the one for this summer), I had a new. I asked her out and she said no too. During something I did a few weeks, I found a new girl that I crushed over. For stupid reasons I had to leave early, so I hadn't had enough time to tell her(it was a really fucking stupid reason, but I know it wasn't right. It just felt automatic what I did. Probably because of my abusive sister).

So that brings us to the reason why I'm writing this. I gave my number to a guy I worked with there. I would say we were some what fine friends in the short amount of time I was there. Now stupidly, workers aren't allowed to text each other(however I might add it says nothing about ex-employees or during the off season), and so I text him without response. One thing I text him today was ""To quote a great man ""Let's go get some ass!"""" The reason being it's the off day, and him and his girlfriend usually hangout together(He, his girlfriend, and I actually all worked together). As well as I get a laugh out of it, and I hope he does too. It helps with the depression. The depression being caused by lack of friends(sorta), and that depression forming in the 2nd grade. However I think it started in 1st, and showed itself in 2nd grade(I said I wanted to kill myself in 2nd grade)

Anyways, after I laughed at the funny test I sent. The depression set in, and how I might truly be alone for the rest if my. Sometimes it feels like god(if there is one, and if there is. I'm not impressed with his work) is a sadist for my suffering to not feel alone

-Create and stick to a strict schedule, it’s important to skew a schedule and stay on it, because once you get really bad, and you let go of it, it’s hard to salvage

-Buy as many clothes as you can, when your depressed you don’t give a shit what you wear, so you just put on whatever you find, so buy and fill your closet with clothes you like, so your font regret how you look later

-Be honest, when you depressed you act different, and when you get bad it’s hard to explain, so say that you think your becoming depressed, so when you inevitably act differently, people understand (and im not talking about parents, more like friends and/or siblings (depending on how close you are with your siblings))",1625190455.0,depression

Also, my sister is currently really struggling with her mental health. I love her, but she does not seem to love herself. She - rather delusionally, if you ask me - thinks she is ugly and fat. She cuts herself, just as I used to do, and has attempted suicide, just as I did.

And all of this started because of second according 

He messaged me and we bonded over a similar taste in music and it was like this for the first day we just shared music and talked about our lives 

Then at night on the second day he opened up to me and told me that he couldn't deal with life his family hated him he didn't have any friends and he had nothing to show for his 28 years of life and he told me he was going to kill himself that night he said if he made it through he would messege me in the morning but not to expect anything

I didn't get much sleep that night and just layed in my bed feeling miserable 

The nest morning he apologized and said that he hit a low point and he didn't want to make me to be sad and that he was sorry I forgave him and we continued talking and sharing music but it felt off 


If I have any response like ok he would get upset and would tell me I was hurting him so I would try my best to not do those 


At one point I started talking with another friend and couldn't messege him back immediately 5 minutes later he asked what was going on and told me I was hurting him 

He started getting weird and would make comments about how he couldn't trust me because he didn't know what I looked like and he asked if I would make a social media just to talk with him 

He was persistent on that last one and would tell me that it hurt him that I wouldn't do it and that I was being mean to someone with cancer (he never mentioned that before btw) and eventually I told him I wasn't going to make an account because I don't like socal media all that much and he already had a place to talk and that he was making me uncomfortable


He stopped talking after that and I feared the worst I decided to re read our messages and seeing everything just put in front of me again it scared me so I asked a friend who agreed that it was weird and told me to block him so I did and that was the end of it 



Until a few days ago when I watched a video on an abusive relationship and what the guy did in that video was too similar to what second did to be a coincidence what they did and how they did it was almost identical

I have been seeing way too many reports for bullshit that doesn't need our intervention. Yes, we are here for you, but somebody having a different view to you is not a reason to report them to us, to get us to remove somebody else's submission.

I don't give a fuck that somebody not liking BTS hurts your feelings, that doesn't mean you have to call it spam or misinformation and waste our time and our resources. While I'm sorting out your bullshit report, I could've instead bettered my life in some way or another. But nah, I wanted to be here to help keep you guys safe from racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, abusive, retarded assholes. And I will continue. But if I find the motherfuckers responsible for constantly filling our mod queue with misinformation reports and spam reports when it's not necessary, I'll be happily handing out bans left, right, and centre.

It's disrespectful, a mockery of us, and is genuinely wasteful of our resources. Dealing with your useless reports has contributed to global warming :)

This is the internet. People are going to disagree, it's just what happens. If you can't deal with that sort of shit, you're in for a wild ride. There are videos of rape, torture, murder, suicides, porn, lots of porn, so much porn, all kinds of fetishes, and so, so much worse. If somebody on reddit hurt your feelings a little bit, stay off the internet, you obviously weren't scrolling through the internet at 9 and watching politicians shoot themselves at press conferences, naked women shitting in cups, grown men having glass jars shattered in their asshole. The internet is a scary place. If you can't deal with someone disagreeing with you on reddit, fuck off back to your bubble and stay there till you can function.

On that note, please use the report function when it's actually necessary. Some guy mentioning masturbation isn't sexually explicit content involving a minor, it doesn't even warrant a NSFW tag. Read the rules, sitewide and sub-specific, if they've been violated, report the offending post/comment.

So Ive been kind of ticked off with everyone today but while I was reading a book there was this one character who was all bright and bubbly and people like him. So I was wondering at this point do I be pissed off my entire year or do I try to change and seem like a real nice and bright and bubbly person. I wanna seem upset and mad an depressed yet ive realized as a negative it can make me look like im to hung up on last years shit yet I also am scared that if im too positive it doesnt seem like I didnt care about last years shit. I just dont wanna send wrong messages to the girl I like but also fucking reputation sticks so how do i get rid of it, as soon as I wake up to tomorrow I will decide from the polls answers. (Before you ask why don’t you decide, my brains having an active civil war and only one side finally came around to the possibility of being happy and bubbly)

Reasons to not get hooked!(Trigger warning),17,12h91b8,teenagersbuthot,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagersbuthot/comments/12h91b8/drugs_reasons_to_not_get_hookedtrigger_warning/,14,"Yo wassup I'm Niko. I am just over 1 year sober of OTC. And wanna share some wisdom with you all, because if anything, we are teens. Our mind is easily suede and i want to sway you away from drugs. 

When I was 13, some stuff happened to me(you can find that in my post history) and it resulted in me becoming hooked on OTC and Prescription medication(yeah, you heard that right). I was 13 when I got hooked, and quit right before my 16th birthday so a little under three years. It caused a lot of issues for me in the long run that I really wanna share with you guys.

1. shit sleep schedule.   
Due to my addiction, I was usually up until the early hours of the morning, high off my mind. I wouldn't get out of bed, and would lay there. High. It caused my body to get use to being up late, and getting maybe 2-3 hours sleep MAX before I had to go to school the next day. Now, though only slightly better, go to bed at 1 am instead of 4 AM.
2. stealing.  
I was stealing pills from my parents, from my sisters, from my friends. I was stealing money to pay for these medications, or i was just- taking them. I didn't care what it took, i was stealing.
3. a silly lil trip to the psych-ward.  
Fuck man, I could go on for hours abt how SHIT the mental health system is and why drugs will just lead you into that shit system. 
4. physical side effects.  
I was having intense hallucinations on these drugs. No not ""fun"" hallucinations like Acid or LSD, but I was seeing shit in my walls. I would hallucinate spiders crawling up my body, things coming out of my walls, peoples feet outside my door and more. Not fun.
5. losing all your loved ones.  
I literally lost everyone. All my friends turned their backs to me. My mom and dad gave up trying to help because what point was there? It wouldn't do anything. My best friend wouldn't look me in the eyes because she said the look in my eyes wasn't me. It was the shell of what once was me. 
6. Becoming friends with the wrong crowd.  
To top off losing friends, i gained new friends, friends who only wanted the worst. Alongside my addiction, I was battling suicide, self harm, and an eating disorder. All these people I hung out with feuled my need for hunger, for pain, for a high. They weren't phased when I ended up in the hospital after an attempted suicide.  


There are so many other reasons but those were my biggest factors into quitting my addiction. I wanted my loved ones back, and to fuck away from the crowd I was getting myself into. I knew my future would be grim if i continued down a path of destruction, so I quit. Why? Because I wanted to see myself grow up. 

If you are thinking about doing drugs, dont. If you're addicted, reach out. Someone is there to listen(including me). Someone is there to help. Do not be scared.

Lately, I’ve noticed that a lot of girls my age are dealing with high anxiety levels and even suicidal thoughts. I’m just a teen, not an expert, but it’s unsettling. Every time I get close to a girls, she opens up about these struggles, and I don’t know how to handle it.

Honestly, it’s tough. I’m a generally happy person, and seeing a friend in pain without being able to help is affecting me too.

I get it, mental health is complex. Family drama, school, social media—it all adds up. But why are girls affected so much more?

So, how can I help? All the support I offer through text or call doesn’t seem to change things. Any advice on how to be a good friend in this situation without draining myself emotionally?

So almost this entire summer I've been in a really bad depression. Everything felt so useless and mundane, I had no will to do anything (like get out of bed, play video games, listen to music, etc.) and my self-esteem was at an all time low. A few days ago I went on an excursion to Greece my school has organised (it's tradition here for upcoming 12th grade students to go abroad for about a week) and it started of great. I got to catch and hang out with my friends. However around 2 (and a half) days in out of 10 days I got sick of being with friends I was put in a room with (I found them a bit clingy and annoying and I was put in a room with them for a 3rd time even tho me and some of my other friends asked and were given permission to be in a room together). Depressions was coming after me and I wasn't ready to cry myself to sleep in front of 3 of my guy friends, especially since a man expressing his emotions here is still considered ""girly and weak"" and everyone ignores mental health issues like they are just a mood and my best friend (pretty much one of my few friends and the only irl friend I could open up to) wasn't really available (let's put it like that) and I wasn't ready to have the first serious mental breakdown in my life. Somewhat thanks to her (my bff) I went on an organized clubbing night. This was my 2nd time clubbing, the 1st time she also made me but I didn't like it. I decided fuck it why not and also this was my first time actually drinking. I didn't drink too much and I'm surprised how good my alcohol tolerance was (as of writing this I'm in my hotel room and completey sober).

Anyways it was an absolutely amazing experience and really opened up my eyes and I'd say at least delayed my depression for a few days. It was the best night of my life and I'm happy I showed many of the people I knew there my ""actual"" self as I am pretty shy buy everyone who actually had a chance to talk to me said they like talking to me. I really feel much better now (also Purple Rain is a great cocktail).

I still don't have a GF bur after years if trying this has really improved my confidence.",1692920447.0,depression

But it can also be emotional emptiness aswell). They may cry alot or (if empty) feel an underlying sense of misery. With depression. They may also have something called alexathymia. Where they can't understand there own, or others emotions. There pupils may aslo be darkened in depression. A depressed person may feel that time is going by incredibly slowly. A person with depression is said to be having a depressive episode. Depression can range from: someone who can usually function in daily life. But is moody, and has decreased productivity than the average population, to someone who is completely incapacitated in bed from misery. Someone who has zero productivity. Someone who can't do any daily tasks. Someone who can feel so sad. They turn psychotic. There can aslo be brief episodes of hypomania (increased mood, either euphoria, or anger) after a depressive episode has ended. Unlike what people think. Depression isn't just sadness. They won't go away just because a good event happened or good news. They are aslo extreme. Doesn't need a sad situation or environment to occur. 

There are specifiers for a depressive episode. The official ones are: Atypical; mood reactivity (meaning, good news and events temporarily increased your mood) and there hands or feat may feel heavy (leaden paralysis), one hour after they wake up. Seasonal pattern; causes depression, ussally in the winter, but sometimes the summer. There is ussally a predomance of certain symptoms. Depending on the seasonal pattern of the depression. Winter: hypersomnia, slowing of speech, thinking, or movement, eating too much or weight gain, difficulty getting along with others, nausea. Summer: accelleration of speech, movement, or thoughts, or anxiety decreased apitte or weight loss, insomnia, peripartum oneset: happens when one is pregnant. Or four weeks after the baby is delivered. It can happen in boys or girls. Anxious: depression with anxious symptoms. Melancholic: little or no interest or pleasure in activity's. Catatonic: the depressed person usually goes into a purposeful stupor (where they don't move). But may rarely become hyperactive and display inappropriate or unnessarcy behaviours. Psychotic: thought disorganisation and speech. Ussally negative (mood concurrency), delusions and sometimes hallucinations. 

There is aslo unprofessionally proved specifiers. Which are as such: endogenous depression: instead of a environmental specifer. It's a cognitive one. Retarded depression. Causes slowing of speech, movement, and thinking. Agitated depression: causes acceleration of speech, movement, and Thinking. 

Signs and symptoms.

I will go in what specifier has the most severe version of the symptom or the ones with the specifer specific symptoms (for example. Melancholic depression will have little or no interest as it's symptom) (unprofessionally proved specifers won't count here):

NORMAL DEPRESSION:

•Irritablity (typically found in kids with depression instead of saddness)
•psychomotor retardation (slowing of speech, movement, or thoughts)
•psychomotor agitation (acelleration of speech, movement, or thoughts)
•self har+ing
•thoughts of death or su'cide (sometimes in an intrusive thought pattern. Or hurting others then killing yourself as an intrusive thought. But only in depression and not by other known causes)
•decreased energy or fatigue (even doing simple tasks or getting up out of bed)
•tearfulness (random crying spells, or crying excessively or increased crying) 
•decreased self esteem
•feeling hopeless, helpless, or worthless,
•decrease in concentration (without other causes)
•decreased memory (without other causes)
•decreased dicision making (without other causes)
•decreased ability to learn (without other causes)
•decreased ablity to think (without other causes)
•inablity to sleep insomnia


ATYPICAL DEPRESSION
•hypersomnia (sleeping excessively)
•heavyness in the legs or arms 1 hour after you wake up (leaden paralysis)
•eating too much or Weight gain
•temporaly increased mood after a good event or news (mood reactivity)

You only need 2 symptoms for this specifer to be put on your depression.


MELANCHOLIC DEPRESSION

•decreased interest in sexual situations, social situations, or work
•decreased ablity to feel pleasure (anhedonia)
•loss of appite (even possibly starving themselves to death because they don't feel hunger at all)
•excessive gulit or remorse

You need one of the two. Decreased interest or decreased ability to feel pleasure.

CATATONIC DEPRESSION

CATATONIC STUPOR:

•not moving and not being able to be moved (resistance to movement)
•waxy flexibility (not moving the whole body but being able to be postured by others, like being able for small parts of there body, like a limb to be moved by others)

EXCITED CATATONIA:

•unessacry or inappropriate movements
•grimacing (making and keeping odd facial expression)
•echolalila (repeating other people's words and sentences)
•Echopraxia (copying other people's movements)
•possible hallucinations
•possible delusions


PSYCHOTIC DEPRESSION

•thought disorganisation
•speech disorganisation
• (ussally) negitive hallucinations (it can either be visual, auditory, or tactile, which means touch delusions, which can be painful)
• (ussally) negitive delusions (like nilelistic believes that the world isn't real. Or that your not real. Or that someone is breaking into your house while your asleep. Or that you killed your family and it's just the imposters of your family now).

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER

It is more than just feeling sad and not taking pleasure out of things you enjoy. Saying things like ""just be happy"" not only doesn't help, but also can make things significantly worse for the person with depression

Point two: Depression has different effects depending on the person. I have met people who have depression because of trauma and people who have it because of their fears and anxiety. Me personally, my depression is almost all with self- worth and feeling completely useless. So if you know multiple people with depression, saying the same things to try to comfort them to both of them, it may not work. 

Point three: Most important is that if someone you know has depression, do your best to just be there for them. I have asked the people I know whit depression and they almost all told me that when someone just cares enough to be there, that helps significantly (and I absolutely agree that it does) and just being able to talk about what is going on in your head with a friend, not a therapist, a friend, and giving them more insight as to what is going on feels like a weight being lifted off your shoulders. 


That's all. I'll take your criticism in the comments.",1670346272.0,depression
