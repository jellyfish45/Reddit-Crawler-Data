Your parents will try sabotage your for anything and the more ammo you give them the worse it will get.\n\nHonestly i cant tell you what the point of all this is or life is. I still question it from time to time. I usually break down and start feeling suicidal. Ive tried killing myself a few times before but for some reason i would die. But only recently i had a bit of luck. Managed to get my Identity document my parents have been delaying for 4 years. I worked for hours on minimum wage at a farm just to save up to pay someone to take me to get my Identity document. Then i payed more to get my learners licences which was alot of traveling cost my alot. Finally im doing my drivers test on Wednesday and should be getting my drivers licence. And when i do i have someone who told me to call them when i get my drivers so they can give me a job. Ill be able to move out and will have a company car.

Keep try your best to get him to fund it because this will be a one way tickect out of your situation if you can pull it off. As soon as you get to england things will be alot safer. Law enforcement is alot stricter there and there are alot less abusers and if you encounter abusers law enforcement will deal with them for you.  Also you have the NHS there where i believe you get free health care so no paying for hospital trips or medicine which will help you. Also the oppurtunities there off get your own job and building a career are very good and to my knowledge jobs on average pay well there. \n\n\nThe best way to deal with your father would be to only speak to him or get involved with him if he is in a good mood. Only then will the outcome of the interaction with him have a chance of being good. But if your parents are similar to mine and pretend the support you but actually wont do anything for you i think change plans. \n\nAnother option you can take apart from studying to get out of the country is volunteer work or backpacking. Look at wwoof.net they have a program where they find you work overseas be it volunteer or normal work. Wwoof stands for world wide oppurtunities on organic farms. They work with  science alot in organic farms which you would enjoy and you will get free accommodation if you work under one of their hosts and free food.

I'll answer this to the best of my ability. I was deeply, deeply lonely and felt overlooked. He was very career-driven (which is a great thing -- ambition is great) but it was the sole driving force behind every decision we made. We stopped having fun and everything in our lives became centered around his work and his goals and next steps to those goals. At some point, I just felt like a decoration in his life. I did all of the chores, all of the cooking, and we didn't ever hang out with friends because he never had the inclination to do so. He was perfectly content with this robotic existence that was focused on his goals and not living. I tried to talk to him about this and how unfulfilling it had become and he told me that I was basically wrong and that it was all a \"me problem\" and that I needed to figure it out. He wasn't willing to try couple's therapy and our sex life basically fell apart because of his personal insecurities. (I'd been dealing with them from the start of our relationship.) \n\nMy husband had a career that would've been devastated by what I did which is why I kept what I'd done a secret for so long. He didn't deserve the embarrassment of what I did during such a critical time in his life. \n\nAs for why I paired up with someone who had a gf when we met -- put simply, he said he was unhappy and that they weren't going anywhere. But that didn't stop him from going on vacations with her, being okay with her buying a house that they moved into after already living together in an apartment. His name wasn't on the lease but he was paying rent. He went along with whatever she wanted included couple's therapy -- and he'd tell me about it and I'd be so confused the entire time. Why was he going to couple's therapy if he was intending on being with me? I rationalized everything because it was all I could do to prevent from collapsing under the reality of everything -- which was that I meant nothing to him. \n\nSo, for clarity -- this affair began long distance. It was easier then for him to treat me like I was the most important person in his life. Once I moved across the country to be with him (March 2018), he didn't break up with her until that November. He continued living with her until January 2019 -- and I was busy making purchases for our home. He essentially traded her out for me. \n\nOnce we started living together, the red flags were flying but I was already so deep in everything. They were still going to see movies and comedy shows and baseball games together. I literally had to hide whenever she was dropping him off at the house because she didn't know I was living there. When I tell you I lowered myself in every way to be with this guy, I'm not kidding. \n\nMy AP told me he'd never cheated before -- and he said this the entire time he'd been carrying on another long distance affair since before I came along. It all makes me feel disgusted. \n\nAs for my husband -- he's overcome a lot of the pain. He was shattered once I came clean about everything but we'd been separated for so long that he'd already had time to process a lot of the pain. I help where I can. But it's really, really hard. I don't always know what I'm doing but I'm trying because he deserves my care, honesty, and support.

I change my entire life for him. Drained my bank account for him. He gave me an STD and made up lies about it. After we broke up, I found out that he had been cheating on me and perhaps with multiple women. I endured a lot of emotional and psychological abuse because of him. All because I didn\u2019t have boundaries.\n\nThe wonderful psychiatrist I am working with right now as pointed out that what I saw as a child has influenced my life today. I spent so much time as a child trying to create peace, trying to hold my family together, and rationalizing the actions of both of my parents. I should\u2019ve never been put in that situation.

After a tiny amount, all the fear and pain would be gone and suddenly I could talk to anyone in a relaxed and sincere way.

I burned all the bridges and had to start over almost from scratch. Recovery was a time of tossing out bad assumptions and finding out what was wrong with my way of seeking relief from pain and depression. \n\nAnyway, after age 36, I slowly started rebuilding myself and really looking deeply in what matters in life and what doesn't.

If you are living in the place where your target language is spoken I am not sure how I would approach learning a language.\nThe two foreign languages I am learning are not spoken here, so I have had to build a plan accordingly. What I do is get as much exposure to the languages as I can. I watch series, movies and listen to as much music in the languages as it's possible. When I got the hang of how the words are separated (I practise the songs word by word, repeat them, and try to remember certain words from them), I start noticing certain words that are repeated in the movies or series I watch (I recommend series because they generally make use of similar words in each episode). Each episode, I write two or three words that I find easy to remember either because they are often repeated or because they are said separated from full sentences. I help myself with the subtitles to know what they mean and to look for them in every episode. I repeat this strategy until I remember lots of words or even just the roots of some of them. After I have gathered enough vocabulary, I start with grammar patterns (I would recommend to find a grammar book for this, they are organized depending on the way a person generally acquires the language). By this point it is easier to notice the patterns because I already know the meaning of many words (many are verbs or just their roots). Then I start practicing with the books while continuing being exposed to the language. Then, I would recommend talking to native speakers in some way to help you speak the language. I have language partners for English and a native teacher to practise Japanese. If you can, maybe take some classes every once in a while just to clear out some doubts you may have about grammar or use of certain words. \nI hope this helped!

Even though it may seem painful all the time it is still a life worth living. Cause this type of thing only happens once. There is no sequel to this mess. You also mentioned something about feeling alienated from society. The only advice I could give you is to try to talk to other people. At school, work, your local coffee shop idc. Wherever there are people, make the effort, get close to someone and discuss how you feel about yourself. Trust me there are always people that are willing to give a helping hand, you just need to have the courage to find them.  If you be nice and yourself i'm sure you could make some friends. Then maybe life will be worth living to you one day and those thoughts will fade. Best of luck man.
