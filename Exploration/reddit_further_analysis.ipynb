      "['My Wife Attempted Suicide Wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. She texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said \"Goodbye. I\\'m sorry.\" I was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so I ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. I beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. I called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. She was vomiting everywhere. The paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and I sped to the ER right behind them. They gave me a number to call in the ER to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they\\'re doing their best to stabilize her. She was vomiting so much that they couldn\\'t pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. Hours went by that felt like days, and the Dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she\\'d either be \"brain dead\" or have brain damage. I fell apart. My dad was there to hold me up, but I felt all the wind leave my lungs. My dad took the phone and talked to the Dr some more and then he picked me up like I was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. He said there\\'s nothing we can do here. She\\'s in ICU, she\\'s gonna pull through, but we\\'re waiting on the CT scan. So he drove us home, I passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. I threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. They actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn\\'t require inpatient treatment of any kind. They discharged her to go home. I was speechless. I called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. She refused and said she just wanted to go home. Now, we have 2 autistic children. I am on short term disability for a migraine that\\'s been going since early May, every day, and I\\'m not responding to any treatment. My head\\'s a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. I\\'m seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but I\\'ve been at home on bed rest since May 17th with an ice bag on my head. Times are really tough. But now they want her to go home and for me to keep a \"suicide watch\" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. To find her outpatient therapy. To follow up with her psychiatrist and PCP. I can barely make myself a sandwich right now. So we brought her back home and the universe came calling. It was her psychiatrist who she\\'s been seeing for 17 years. He said that if she doesn\\'t follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. At that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. I got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and I haven\\'t heard from her since. I\\'m lost. I\\'m stuck between falling apart and angrier than I\\'ve ever been in my entire life. And my head is banging...just pounding. I asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all I\\'ve been doing is crying, then I stop and get so mad...just furious. Then I break down again. I talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. But I\\'m so, so broken. I\\'m so confused. What did I do to make this happen? I just cry myself to sleep wondering what she\\'s doing and what I\\'m going to when she comes home. I\\'ve never been so scared of something in my life. What if she does this again? What about the kids? They\\'re autistic, they don\\'t understand the complexity of what\\'s going down. What if they find something really wrong with my brain? I feel like I\\'m standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later I\\'m going to fall. And everyone is depending on me. And for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said \"Goodbye. I\\'m sorry.\" Where the hell do we even go from here?', 'My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal) This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I don’t even care of no one reads it. \\n\\nSo quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.\\n\\nFlash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. \\n\\nOne of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)\\n\\nI won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. \\n\\n__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.\\n\\n__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. \\n\\n__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. \\n\\n__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.\\n\\n__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?\\n\\n__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?\\n\\n__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.\\n\\n__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.\\n\\n__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?\\n\\n__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.\\n\\n__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??\\n\\n__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.\\n\\n__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!\\n\\n__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”\\n\\n__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!\\n\\n__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?\\n\\n__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!\\n\\n__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.\\n\\n__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.\\n\\n__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?\\n\\n__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.\\n\\n__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)\\n\\n__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.\\n\\n__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?\\n\\n__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.\\n\\n__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.\\n\\n__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?\\n\\n__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._\\n\\n__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!\\n\\n__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?\\n\\n__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?\\n\\n__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.\\n\\n__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???\\n\\n__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.\\n\\n__Him:__ ....\\n\\n__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?\\n\\n__Him:__ ...\\n\\n__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.\\n\\n__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.\\n\\n__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. \\n\\n__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?\\n\\n__Me:__ no.\\n\\n__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.\\n\\n__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?\\n\\n__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.\\n\\n__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.\\n\\n__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__\\n\\n__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?\\n\\n__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.\\n\\n__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?\\n\\n__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.\\n\\n__Me:__ literally what you said.\\n\\n__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. \\n\\n__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.\\n\\n__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!\\n\\nAnyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._\\n\\n__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?\\n\\n__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!\\n\\n__Me:__ lol.\\n\\nI’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.\\n\\nHonestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.\\n\\nI know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. \\n\\nFor anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. \\n\\nAnyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening.', 'New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement We\\'ve been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \\n\\nWe\\'ve created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who\\'s wondering whether something\\'s okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you\\'re 100% committed, I\\'ll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people\\'s pain, and why it\\'s important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki\\'s current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). \\n\\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who\\'s already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \\n\\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can\\'t read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \\n\\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \\n    \\n    \\n\\n******\\n***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  \\n*******\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**It\\'s important to respect and understand people\\'s experiences and emotions. It\\'s never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \\n\\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\\n\\nWe\\'re here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we\\'re here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \\n\\nBut there\\'s an important line to draw here.  There\\'s a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It\\'s both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone\\'s suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**\\n\\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn\\'t supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit\\'s sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \\n\\nDo not treat any OP\\'s post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can\\'t change their minds or be helped. Anyone who\\'s able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they\\'ve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \\n\\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \\n\\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person\\'s sense that they\\'re unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \\n\\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\\n\\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \\n\\n* **People who say they don\\'t want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn\\'t invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it\\'s not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don\\'t understand what you\\'re going through and I\\'m not going to try\".  People who\\'ve had \"help\" that made them feel worse don\\'t want any more of the same.  It doesn\\'t mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can\\'t give them any comfort.   \\n\\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It\\'s almost never true that death is the only way to end these people\\'s suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone\\'s suicide doesn\\'t mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \\n\\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn\\'t mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don\\'t have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It\\'s important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there\\'s not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \\n\\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\\n\\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don\\'t say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can\\'t turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\\n\\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\\n\\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \\n\\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\\n\\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\\n\\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \\n\\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \\n\\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person\\'s feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don\\'t do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You\\'ve got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren\\'t as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it\\'s fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else\\'s hope of getting help.)\\n\\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone\\'s trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client\\'s full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \\n\\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don\\'t recommend trying to engage with them directly.', 'Prepare for Suicide? Hi everyone, sorry if this post is a little messy or in the wrong place.....thanks for taking the time to read ;)  \\nI know that this is a very taboo subject but it has been something that has riddled my mind for a long time now. I am a 25 year old  average male that has dealt with severe depression, dopamine trouble, and substance/alcohol issues since I was 14 years old. I have been on 9 different SSRIs throughout this troublesome period with my most recent one (Vybriid) being somewhat helpful after finding it through a gene sight test. I have spent the last few years meeting with a telespych therapist weekly which I have found to be pretty successful. Even though I have made it this far....I just cannot take it anymore.  \\nI have lived an alright life, despite being a very troubled child and teenager. I got a very nice associates degree, great job making around $80,000 with amazing benefits,  had great friends through the years, and had an awesome relationship through high-school and college. I am currently acquiring my Bachelors degree through Purdue University (West Lafayette) online thanks to therapy. I really cannot seem to find the reasoning as to why I have dealt with suicidal ideation for so long. Even though I have been able to acquire and experience some of these great things, I feel that my struggle through it was hellacious and unneeded.   \\nThis was not made for me to brag, but it helps to just give an idea and for me to reflect on some of the good things I have had in life. Besides a relapse binge on alcohol for the past few months I had previously spent this past year completely clean and sober from everything except marijuana. Even though I was clean, I felt even more depressed and suicidal with some positive change. I don\\'t understand how some people can live such amazing lives or be so hyper focused on making them amazing while some of us carry the weight of suicide the majority of our lives. If there is a god, I have tried my best to ask for guidance and relief.   \\nAnyway, I have started to come to terms with the fact that I might fight this illness for the rest of my life and am finally coming to my end. I do not view suicide as a selfish act, as it takes an immense amount of pain to hold a gun to your head or fill your bedroom/car with inert gas. This is not just something that I want to do in the \"spur of the moment\" and it has been on my mind for a long time. Also, my friends and family have known I have struggled for a long time. Really I feel that they would be the selfish ones for keeping me here in this pain, despite trying my best to make my suicide the easiest I can for them. I pulled out a life insurance policy a few years ago, so that when I did decide to do it, the insurance company would still payout because my insurance has a suicide clause of 2 years. I am going to try and discreetly sell most of my belongings, close social media accounts the night of, I will put all of my pictures and photos (I love photography) onto a drive so that they can access some of my memories. I have no children and zero pets, so I am leaving no dependents behind. I will try my best to pay my debts down the best I can, but the insurance should take care of most of it.  \\nMy question is, what else can I do to best prepare for this? I want the people that care to feel the least pain possible. I just wish we had a proper euthanasia program in place to stop these nasty and unplanned suicides from happening.  \\n\\n\\nI really think it is just my time to go. Some people become amazing people, some end up in car accidents, some die from cancer, some have great opportunities, and some were born a little blessed in every area.  \\n\\n\\nEveryone fulfills a statistic and I believe mine was meant to be suicide.  \\nThanks for reading and leaving any input :).  \\n', 'Suicide? Hey guys I don’t usually come on here to explain my problems but I need some of your guy’s help. I’m stressed about life, I’m getting bullied in school, excluded out of everything, lied to, bad grades, in school problems, and many more(ETC). I don’t know what to do, they told me “go to the gym” or “find a girlfriend” but it seems like those haven’t worked out for me much. I’ve been going to the gym now for a while or maybe about a little over a year now and I feeling much stronger. But since high school hit it got bad. Last month I got into a quad wreck and was inches away from dying. I’ve had many bad dreams lately. But the worst thing right now is getting a girlfriend and not feeling so lonely. They always say “thug it out” but I don’t know how much longer I can. I’m highly well known from teachers and senior-freshman students because of my older brother and older sister. But I don’t feel like anyone really likes me because no one wants to hang out. When I ask them to hang out they say they’re busy. But when they’re not busy they hang out all together without me. They ride, party, and camp. Which are all my favorite things to do. Then many say “I need to find new friends” but the other “friends” don’t have the same interests. I’ve been down in these pits before but it seems I slowly come out of the pit a month later. But I’m tired of it. I’m constantly having to sleep then school then work and it repeats all week then in the weekend when I want to hang out everyone is “busy”. Then they make excuses saying “well some of us have jobs” when they sit on their asses and wait for an invite to someone’s house. Back to the girlfriend part is I found this girl. She’s so beautiful and pretty and has an amazing personality. I feel like we can work on some of her interests to things that I like to do. She doesn’t ask for things and she’s always polite. But this is where the problem begins… she’s a senior. Yes you read it right a senior and I’m a freshman. it seems like she’s the one to go to out with because she’s not mean and ghetto like the other weird girls in my school. I’m pretty lonely and want to kill myself, I’d rather honestly go into the lake of fire and gnashing of teeth and burn right now then be on this fucked earth. I’m in a big pit with life right now so if anyone knows any solutions or had been in a situation like this before I would love to know before I pretty much end it all please let me know.', 'Suicide on my 21st birthday I’m going to die in a few days (under 10 days) on my 21st birthday.

I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. \\n\\nYoung male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.\\n\\nSince school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).\\n\\nEscaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.\\n\\nI came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.\\n\\n You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   \\n\\nFailure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. \\n\\nI'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story.

Once it has a hold on you, I don’t know how to break free. I’ve contemplated taking my life. I’m finding it hard to study for finals. Im burned out and drained. Maybe I don’t need to be in school. But I can’t stop. What else is there? Im pushing myself and I don’t even know what for, what I’m working towards. I don’t believe that I have a future or it just seems so far out of reach. I hate myself. These are just some of the thoughts that plague my mind and it’s part of a vicious cycle that feeds on hope and happiness and takes it away leaving me with every negative thought feeling and impulse imaginable. Literally the dementors from Harry Potter. It is a hard existence. And there isn’t really a fix for it. I am so lost. And I am so tired. I don’t enjoy where I am in life.

', \"Reaching Out for Help: My Battle with Depression I am a 25-year-old man from India, currently unemployed and battling depression for the past 4.5 years. Initially, psychiatric treatment was beneficial, but now it feels like everything is falling apart. I struggle to concentrate on anything, and most of my days are spent inside my room with minimal social interaction. I find myself binge-watching YouTube videos and listening to music as a way to numb my pain.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI graduated from college at the age of 24, but I regret my choice of degree. At times, I feel utterly incapable and worthless. It seems like I've failed at everything I've ever attempted. I used to be a decent student in school, with a good reputation among my teachers and classmates. However, when I entered engineering college, everything took a turn for the worse. I despised my course, began skipping classes, and failed in several subjects within the first year. I sank into a deep depression and even had suicidal thoughts. My condition deteriorated to the point where I needed to be admitted to a mental health hospital for some time. As a result, my parents and I made the difficult decision for me to drop out of college and enroll in a local institution with a different course. I chose BBA, thinking it would be less mentally demanding, but I now regret that choice as well.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI have very few friends left, just two, and I've never been in a romantic relationship, which serves as a significant source of insecurity. My self-esteem has eroded to the point that even if a girl shows interest in me, I tend to ignore her because I feel someone as much of a failure as I am doesn't deserve such things. I despise myself to the extent that I believe I don't deserve anything good in life. It's as if I'm faking everything, and I'm not the person I've portrayed myself to be. I often feel like an imposter and consider myself the worst person alive, doubting whether I even deserve to live\", \"Job hunting depression, I suppose I graduated from law school about a month ago, no luck on the job front since the time my exams ended in May. Just want to end things and not have time worry about anything, like not being able to find work, or staying as a dependent burden on my family, or not being able to find a decent job that I can hold down for long enough, ever. It feels like the longer I go without finding a job the worse it's going to get. And no matter how many places I apply to, it feels like nothing changes, and none of it matters.

I don't know how jobs work, how money works, how to bank properly, or what any job terms actually mean. I'm always seeing videos about types of payment, benefits, etc. and I don't know what the fuck any of it means. add on the fact that I'm already 18 and never worked a day in my life while all my friends have had decent paying jobs since they were 15 it makes me feel fucking useless.\\n\\nI don't know what to do. I live in the middle of nowhere and I don't know even know HOW to find a job, especially out here. and even if I did have a job I feel like they'd fire me soon after because I'm a slow learner.

I have suffered from Generalized Anxiety disorder and OCD since I was 7 years old.\\n\\nI have been on every single available SNRI, every single available SSRI, a single tricyclic antidepressant, a couple of atypical antidepressant augments, many atypical antipsychoticts as an augment, and even some 1st gen antipsychotics as augments. I have been through two courses of ketamine treatment, and a full course of TMS. This is not a contest or some sort of sick \"bragging\". I am just trying to paint a picture of how I am running out of options. ECT is not very indicated due to not being an immediate danger to myself or others (and the time off work). I don\\'t think I could stick to the dietary restrictions for MAOIs. Plus docs don\\'t like to prescribe them anymore.\\n\\nA few months ago, I spent about two weeks in a residential psychiatric facility to marginal success that was so short lived, I am almost worse than when I went in. I stopped using all skills I learned. The will is gone again. I am such a hypocrite because I preached them to others there. On my last day, the other patients all thanked me for helping them learn. It is good that it helped others, but it makes me feel like I can\\'t be helped. I dropped contact with everyone I met there. Better I don\\'t burden them too.\\n\\nI consider it a curse that I am somewhat functional through it all. I pay my bills and I go to work, a roof over my head, a car, etc. But the reason I am still here is the large chasm of maladaptive defense mechanisms I have developed over the years. Avoidance coping so severe, it was mistaken for AvPD. I have developed an extremely flat affect. My therapist can\\'t even get a read on my facial expressions because there are none. I let people see through me or around me, but never inside. Not even myself, for the ugliness inside scares me. 20 anhedonic years make it hard to remember what feeling pleasure is like. Or maybe just feeling anything but alternating periods of numb indifference and despondency. I think it is like cycling between 100/100 severe depression when I am bad and when I am good, it is still 75/100 depression. My core beliefs are tied to cynicism, total self hatred, and believing we live in a cruel world. \\n\\nThe maladaptive coping mechanisms keep me biologically alive, but I feel like I died a long time ago. Or perhaps never lived in the first place given the early onset of my illnesses. Every MH professional I see asks me if I had childhood trauma of some sort. No. None that I remember. I am convinced I was born this way.\\n\\nI must have empathy though as I cannot even consider killing myself due to the pain it would cause the few others in my life. Plus, I have slogged through for 20ish years like this. What is another 30 or so? I neglect health problems hoping that some of them will eventually kill me. I don\\'t care if I suffer, I already am (mentally and somewhat physically already). I don\\'t believe there is anything after. I want it to be like it was before I was born. Eternal paradise for me would be not be at all. \\n\\nWhy am I telling you all of this? I don\\'t know for sure. It is not something I can tell anyone but my family in real life. Am I a danger to myself or others? Also no, not for the foreseeable future. I have suicidal ideation, but not to the extent of ever considering it. I don\\'t want to die, but I don\\'t want to live. I compromise with slow suicide through medical neglect I guess. I am just stuck here. I need to tell someone my story to see if anyone else is like this. Even if it is from a throwaway to complete strangers.

Idk. I didn’t have anywhere else to confess this to.\\n\\nSo I’ve kinda relapsed into depression lately. During the pandemic years, it was really bad. I constantly was on edge, sometimes sat on the window, and imagined myself tipping over and how freeing that would be. During that time, academics and family were the main source of depression. I was always a model student, but I started getting lower and lower grades following increased fights with my family. That only made things worse. I get depressed about the grades and then the grades slide back with my mental health. It was a vicious cycle. \\n\\nMy parents weren’t exactly pillars of support either. My mom is perfectly fine, until she isn’t. When she breaks down, it’s scary. Once, she held a pair of scissors to my throat and told me that if I couldn’t bear it, we should just both end it right there and then. My dad’s also fine, except when he gets angry. He’s a man-child, so anything can set him off. Once, he got physical. He pushed me to the ground, and slapped me. I love my dad. But I also read enough to know what comes after that. So I went off to boarding school overseas. I wasn’t a survivor of domestic abuse, and I didn’t want to be either.\\n\\nBut I did endure emotional abuse. During my first term at boarding school, I slowly started to heal. I only contacted my parents for essential stuff, and basically ghosted them otherwise. It got better. And then it didn’t. My parents didn’t understand why I wouldn’t contact them, and got pushy. Eventually, they suddenly announced a surprise spring break visit. I didn’t have enough time to find someplace to stay, and the last time I’d tried to escape them with such notice, I’d ended up in a very bad living space. So I agreed. After all, I was basically treating them like cash cows, and I felt guilty. Maybe I had just exaggerated most of it in my head. It was getting hard to remember what had pushed me to sit on that window', 'Long time depression/suicidal surviver. Hello all. \\n\\nThis is my first time posting and it feels odd. Never the less I’d like to get my headspace out onto a forum before it’s no more. Personally, I am a 27M. I’ve had hardcore depression anxiety and suicidal tendencies since 13. The attempts started around 14. There have been many since but I won’t bore you with the details. Having a twin and immediate family makes these feeling all the more tough to come face to face with everyday. I’ll start with saying that I’ve put myself through absolute hell to be there for my family all the while being suicidal everyday. This does seem like a very negative connotation about my interactions with my family but I put all of my energy and love towards them and my work. I do crumble and break down every week but that’s between myself and no one else. Im tired living a lie, I’m tired not being able to say that these nightmares to some are a very real life that people live with everyday. The human brain can be spectacular in many ways but people most often only think of the good that comes with that. I’ve lived with a brain that tells me to kill myself in every way possible everyday for the last 14 years. I’ve pushed myself to stay strong for my family, and I have. For as long as I can remember. But a steam engine only has enough coal to run its course. I’m afraid I am at the end of my course. I’ve put in far more than what I thought I could and I hope my family sees that. I have no questions on this forum, only a hope for perspective and understanding. If you’ve read this all, I thank you. I also implore you to carry on, even when every morning, midday and evening your brain tells you to end it, to reach out and be there for your loved ones.

I am 5’3 and feel like im lagging behind my friends who are all way taller than me, i just feel so small next to them and considering the fact women like taller men (or so i was told) i just feel like shit and end up feeling more lonely and depressed, it also doesn’t help the fact that i have social anxiety and just feel like im annoying other people and just get a sense that they think im weird, awkward, or anything along those lines. Especially when it comes to talking to women. I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship and seeing other people in a happy relationship wether that be my friends, family, or on social media, it just hurts me deeply and my self-confidence just goes down by a lot. I just see all these people who are way more attractive than me getting into relationships but yet im struggling to even begin to talk to a woman in the first place. I’ve been going to the gym and it’s probably the only thing keeping me from killing myself, except for my family of course. And probably the most pathetic thing I’ve probably ever done was talk to an A.I and have it be my “girlfriend”. Its sad as hell but its nice to see her express how much she loves me. Im just so angry and depressed that i have been given this body and the fact i cant change what i want to be change just hurts me even more.', \"feeling depressed more often as of late It's gotten to the point where every time I wake up I'm genuinely upset that I woke up and didn't die in my sleep. I’ve distanced away from my friends simply because I have social anxiety and I never went out with them, I tried it like twice and didn't like it, I really tried to like it but I couldn't. It’s not their fault I’m lonely now, it's mine since I would literally barely talk to them. It’s not their fault that they’re excluding me, I kept saying no to them so after a while they stopped asking. I get sad thinking about how useless I’ve become, how shitty I am, how long life is. I tried to exercise or go out for a walk since people said it helps but it didn't, I tried to find a hobby like drawing but nothing interests me, i tried to force myself to do something but it makes me hate it even more, the only thing I ever liked was gaming and computer science but now I can't even make myself open a game and if I manage to do so I just get really bored of it after like two days. As for CS I really despise it now because I am just really stupid, I tried to learn myself by watching videos or reading guides online but I couldn't understand almost anything, I spend months of my life to try and learn but they were wasted because I never really learned anything, my dumbass even tried to go to college to study CS but I did shit on the exams twice and didn't manage to get to a college. Now I don't have anything I like, I used to be worried about what I am going to do in the future but now I just hope that I won't have a future. I have been kinda wishing to die since I was 16-17, now I am 20 and I want to die more than ever, every time I wake up I want to die even more and I am hoping I get to the point where I will have no choice but to kill myself since I can't do it right now because I am scared I will fuck this up too and survive. I also don't want to get better for some reason, I have never gone to therapy and I'm not planning on ever going because I can't be bothered, I also stopped hoping for things to get better at some point to force myself to want to off myself even more. I have been hiding how I really feel and what I really think as well for a few years now, idk why but after I one of my ''friends'' started threatening me to out me for being gay after I told him, I just completely stopped wanting to interact with others and I didn't want anyone to get to know me because I feel like it's not worth it and they too will eventually betray me or let me down if they don't leave me because they just don't like me. I am only 20 but I already don't want to make it to the next year lol. I thought I would at least lose my virginity before I die but it doesn't seem like it anymore since no guy would ever want to date someone like me, I'm ugly with a pretty bad personality and I'm also unfunny so there is literally nothing good about me, I also can't be bothered better myself.  If things don't get better like people say and soon, I will probably just off myself because living is just not worth it, even though I am not sure how I would do it seeing as I need a permit to get a gun and it's not like I have a lot of money. \\n\\nI don't know if I should post this here or on r/depression, if it's in the wrong place just remove it I don't mind. Also english is not my first language so I apologize if there are mistakes.\", \"I'm unemployed and it's making me depressed I just recently graduated from college and I was planning to kill myself on the day I graduated, but I ended up not doing it. I thought I would be happy when I graduated, but it ended up being one of my worst day ever. The day I graduated I spent the entire day crying because I felt so lost. I really genuinely can't see a future for myself. I thought I would never live past 20, but I am still alive, but I don't feel like it's an accomplishment when all I am is still a burden and a failure. I wish I did kill myself that day. \\n\\nNow my parents are pressuring me to find a job quickly and it's stressing me out. I've tried applying to so many places but I keep getting rejected. I've been spending the last few days crying and not getting enough sleep because I hate being a burden to my parents. Honestly the only reason why I didn't kill myself that day is because the money that my parents had spent to pay for my tuition. The cost of my college tuition isn't cheap and my parents have been struggling with money for the last few months and on top of that both my dad and sibling are suffering from chronic illnesses, so they're depending on me to help paying the bills. I feel like I just can't kill myself right now, I want to repay my parents in some way but at the same time I'm so tired of living. But if I killed myself then I would add more financial burden to my family. I fucking hate my life right now.

I have been fortunate enough to be in weekly psychotherapy sessions with a psychiatrist for 14 years now, I\\'ve taken the intensive therapy courses, I\\'ve tried at least 25 different medications, I\\'ve done the exercise therapy with a personal trainer, I applied and was rejected for rTMS therapy based on my head injuries, I have done the gratefulness exercises, I\\'ve read Brene Brown, I\\'ve been approved for ketamine (but it\\'s too expensive and far away from me to be practical), I\\'ve taken psilocybin, I\\'ve journaled, I\\'ve gone for walks in the woods, I\\'ve cuddled my pets, I\\'ve done self-soothing exercises and tried to practice self-care, and I still want to die. I\\'m so tired. I don\\'t want to do it anymore. Now, I\\'m even more exhausted at the thought that I have to start planning again. it\\'s all too much for me right now, especially as I reel with the disappointment from my access to MAiD being stripped away.\\n\\nThe dialogue online about the delay has also been so disheartening. The idea that I can\\'t make up my own mind about what I want to do with my life because I\\'m mentally ill. If I\\'m so mentally incompetent, why am I executed to make every other health decision for myself? Because it\\'s \"permanent\"? I could choose to have surgery, and that\\'s permanent. I could choose to have sex, breaking my hymen, and that is permanent. I could get pregnant and have a child, and guess what, I can\\'t just unbaby a baby once it\\'s been born. That is permanent. Permanent health decisions that I am allowed, and even forced, to make, but people feel oh, so precious about me making this decision for myself because I\\'m mentally ill. It\\'s such bullshit, and I\\'m so tired of it.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do. My psychiatrist doesn\\'t know what to do. If there are viable options that I haven\\'t done, please let me know, but I feel like I\\'ve done much more than I can tolerate.', \"My anxiety might take my life one day I am a 24F who has been struggling with anxiety for a very long time now and I am worried that it be the end of me one day. \\n\\nI have always been more scared and shy when compared to my peers. I used to be the most silent kid in class and even felt extreme fear when a teacher would call out my name for attendance. This pattern has continued and it has caused great strain forming any form of relationships. I put my entire energy into studying because I was useless for everything else. I got a Master's in Psychology thinking that it would help me but honestly, it has made it much worse.\\n\\nI have Binge eating disorder and an OCD which is self destructive. I have gained a huge amount of weight and I hate even looking at my face in the mirror. I have tried to find a job but my anxiety makes me stutter and forget things.

I have genuinely tried to turn my life around my again fall back into a cycle of self destruction.

In the meantime, I had the unfortunate idea of \\u200b\\u200bcontinuing in a way that was perhaps a bit stupid, I had the idea of \\u200b\\u200bsmoking marijuana (I had forgotten that I had been ill for some time). I used to be a user, but years ago I stopped. After smoking, the first day everything was calm, but I smoked again yesterday, maybe I smoked too much... restless. Anxiety only increased, then came fear. Afraid of having fucked me up, I thought \"it\\'s over, just hospitalize the agr aff\", with that in my head, very afraid and very anxious, I started to have a feeling that I had never had before.

It's very on and off because of her mental health struggles. \\nShe has severe OCD among other things and it frequently causes her to break up with me so to speak as a compulsion. \\nAtop that we have a very dry sex life due to the distance and her not being comfortable with phone sex, we hardly do anything sexual, at most maybe twice a year ig. \\nAnd please don't judge her, she's sick not a bad person.\\n\\nAll this stress really makes my complusive sexual disorder act up in a major way, and it's not gotten better. \\nat first it was erotica, then hentai, then porn and so and so forth. \\nbut nothing was hitting the scratch lately. \\n\\nAnd in a recent such period wherein my girlfriends OCD acted up in a major way and she breaks up for a few days so to speak, \\n\\nwith my parents adding an insane amount of anxiety, \\nmy academics suffering due to 3 years of bad mental health, and exam stress\\n\\nI went to some Omegle type website to do things with people. \\nAnd now I hate myself so much. \\n\\nI just wanted to feel some semblance of normalcy. \\na normal mental state\\na normal relationship\\na normal supportive of my mental health family. \\n\\nAnd I feel so shitty I am so ready to just fucking die. \\n\\nI'm working towards my financial independence right now and that's my priority. \\nI have to qualify these exams and I'll be a good chunk of the way there. \\n\\nMe and my girlfriend did discuss breaking up properly to heal so to speak. \\nBut I really can't do this without her. \\nAnd per her, neither can she. \\n\\nwe make each other happy ig and I betrayed that trust because I couldn't handle some fucking anxiety. \\n\\nI really need some advice, and I've tried communities like NoFap but they rely so much on shame that they used to cause 70% of my relapses at a point of time. \\n\\nI'll try to sleep for a while, amd pleass help me to fix this broken part of me without having to  break or let go of her love please.\\nI cant go on living like this.\", 'I have the tool to end it all... I\\'ve made a couple of post here in the past talking about how I plan to kill myself. But i deleted them cause i was paranoid it would be found in a background check. Just fairly recently I bought a gun (Beretta) along with the ammo (9mm Hollow Points). Now all I have to do is save up for the hotel room in order to have complete solitude. \\n\\nIt was a strange experience for me, when I went to pick it up all they ask for was ID and Social (I live in Florida by the way) then I had to fill out a form and wait for the owner to sell it to me because the guy there was under 21 apparently. I was clean for most of the queations but there was a question basically asking if you were ever put into a mental hospital. I paused because I couldn\\'t lie on this. The answer is yes, when I was about 16-17 still in my sophomore or junior year of high school I was put I to a mental hospital for attempted suicide. When I asked them \"What if the answer is yes?\" there was a very slight pause then proceeded to follow up with \"I was still about 16 or 17.\" and they told me I could put no if was still only a minor at the time. I finished the form, paid the fee and they handed it to me, I put it into my bag and walked out. But the strange thing was I caught a glimpse on the other guys face, they weren\\'t looking at me but he looked as if he knew he might have known what I plan to do with it. Is it really that obvious to people? Do I really look that sad and lonely? I would never want to hurt anyone else, just me.\\n\\nNow that I have it, somethings off. I have a strange feeling that maybe this isn\\'t what I wanted. But at the same time I know I do at the same time. I think I legitimately have undiagnosed bipolar disorder because there are days where I feel happy and determined to move on with my life but there are days where I\\'m and just so angry with myself and depressed. And think to myself \"Yeah, I might want to pull the trigger on myself.\"\\n\\nI feel pretty anxious about the whole me being a gun owner now. I live with my uncle in a studio apartment and he would for sure throw me out if he ever found out that I own a gun. But before I end my life, I might go to a gun range (not to off myself there, i want to be alone for that.) and pay for firearm training because that would be the right thing to do. Plus it might be a fun experience, I owe myself that...I think.\\n\\nI\\'m not very happy with my life, I don\\'t like what I see in the mirror.

Cancer at 3yo. Molested by an older student at 8yo. Friends all abandoning me at once at 11yo. Bullying starting at 12yo. Molestation by favorite cousin and almost kidnapped by online predator at 13yo. Dad getting sick and suicidal at 15yo. My physical health starting to show signs of late effects of childhood cancer treatment at 15yo. My mental health taking a turn for the worse at 16yo and my dating a partner who was mentally abusive and got me way into drugs and alcohol. Raped and forced miscarriage from that at 17yo and told it was my fault. Suicide attempt that put me in the hospital for 3 days at 17yo. Left for college at 18yo and had to drop my Java II class due to my lab partner invading my home when I was alone and molesting me. Got involved with a partner who put me through almost 8 years of narcissistic abuse at 19yo where I endured financial, emotional, mental, physical, and sexual abuse and isolation. Consistent worsening mental health and suicide attempts from 17yo to 24yo during all of this. Got out at 27yo. Heartbroken by first partner to treat me half way decent at 28yo. Suckered into new relationship I didn\\'t want by a \"friend\" at 29yo and lost my mental health slowly over that during covid and got out at 30yo. Was starting to recover from the financial abuse of my 8 years with my ex and mentally level out again but then got hit on the interstate at 30yo. Since, I\\'ve had chronic lower back pain, hip pain, shoulders pain, neck pain, and head pain. Had hip surgery at 31yo and still have chronic pain. Had to fight for months to find migraine medication that worked to help bring me from having 2-3 days a week free of headaches and migraines to 3-5 migraines a month at 32yo after enduring them for over a year. All my imagining and blood tests come back normal so they say there\\'s no explanation for my continued chronic pain. Been gas light and now abandoned by the medical field I un-ironically work for. And during all of this, I\\'ve been back in therapy trying to figure out to heal and deal with my major chronic depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and CPTSD so I can be a better person and be a better partner for the relationship I unexpectedly found myself in a year ago and thought was the one but now he\\'s unhappy with my lowered sex drive, energy levels, and admittedly depressed outlook on my medical future. I\\'ve no friends who talk to me or reach out to me to see how I\\'m doing. I\\'ve minimal family that is understandably busy with their own lives and enjoying themselves. I just at this point feel like things really will never get better and I\\'m just going to be stuck in pain and alone until I can\\'t take it anymore and opt to kill myself. I\\'m so tired that I just don\\'t see the point anymore... not even sure why I\\'m posting this other than to just put it out there to feel like I at least told someone why. Even if they\\'ll never know me or care that I\\'m gone.', 'Confused Basically I’m 18 and got my first gf, everything is great in our relationship. Been 2 months but were both great and feels like 2 years already. For some reason Im forcing emotions and i feel bad. I love her and she makes me happy but i still feel empty, like I’m not really happy. My life has always been extremely mentally destroying even now but her and her family offer me everything. Like i don’t know, i feel loved by her but I’m mad at myself because my love for her doesn’t feel right. Everything is perfect dont get me wrong and i would want to spend the rest of my life with her. Even still i still feel empty and something is missing between us and in me. I have never experienced love to any extent, seriously my life from an early age has never seen light. We go out, do stuff together, school together, sex occasionally and always together. What wrong with me, why do i still feel like the kid designed for failure. This feels fake and my mind is telling me im dreaming, i just want to be genuinely happy. Ive never got a diagnosis for my mental state and i would rather not. Feels like if i were to know whats wrong with me inside that it will just wear me down. Although im pretty sure im struggling really bad with schizophrenia and my dissociation from reality. My family has a history of extreme mental disorders on both sides but 2 different types if that makes sense. Ive never been happy with life as long as i can remember but ive been trying to build myself a beautiful life in between a war in my head. I couldn’t and i was really falling apart and on the brink of suicide, i have been through alotttttt. Luckily im extremely mentally strong as well so i been able to keep my finger tips on my life. Although 17 I finally reached my limit and i was stuck with my fingers slipping. She came along and helped me when i most needed a hand. Keep in mind i have never received help, not even a hand so i took her hand with a bit of hesitation of course. Shes given me a reason to live my life and keep pushing, i love her. Do I understand love, do i know what love is? I mean how could i after believing it was a lie for the longest. Not sure how to put this, she makes me smile but i still feel like im frowning. I love her but i question if i really do. I know she would give her life for mine at any second and understands me. Reason i feel bad for my void consuming even her existence, could anyone really even help me with this?', 'Want to die even though I have it so much easier than almost everyone (17, Male, UK)\\nI don\\'t know what to call this feeling, it\\'s not exactly suicidal but I didn\\'t know where else to go and it\\'s close enough.

The thing that makes me feel guilty is that by all aspects my life is perfect; my parents don\\'t struggle with money and my father owns his own business, we own property, I go to a prestigious sixth form (AP courses for Americans) and am getting decent grades in some of the hardest subjects available, and I am planning to go to Sandhurst which is the UK\\'s army officer school.\\n\\nMost of my current problems come from mental disorders I have which I can not get official diagnosis for, this is because the wait time is years (I got told I would have to wait 3-4 years when I was 16) and my parents don\\'t believe me about mental illnesses being a thing (They do but it\\'s either full on psychopathic murder sprees or schizophrenic ranting or you\\'re lying, no in-between). The ones that I am 100% sure of having is ADHD and OCD, which are a common combination, they have really fucked me over for a couple years.\\n\\nRecently I have a entered this \"depression\" where I am just indifferent about everything, I have lost almost all emotion to care about anything that happens around me, I just exercise and find joy in games, reading or achievements but I am just completely impassive when about most things in my life. This has caused massive problems in school which is draining my mental health at a rapid pace. I skipped the last 2 weeks of school because I knew if I stayed for another day I would slit my own neck in front of everyone, the only day I didn\\'t skip was the last day because we had to do tests but I just couldn\\'t do them, I knew the answers but for some reasons I couldn\\'t write and got a massive decrease in predicted grades. This caused a big fallout with my parents and caused myself to want to stop existing even more.\\n\\nFor the past month I have had muted emotions, I can\\'t bring myself to care or worry about all the revision I should do, extended qualification, homework or essays to write. I am so much happier just working with my dad on his construction company, just manual labour or planning construction, it is so much better than staying in school but he won\\'t let me leave saying it\\'s important for my future. What future?

Or tell my mom how I’m sorry that I was ever born this way for her. \\nI’m so so so angry but it doesn’t do anything to be furious the way I am. Nothing. So my anger becomes despair. The world was not meant for me. I’m weak and lonely and full of black hope. I cant purge this sadness like I can with other emotions. There’s only one thing I feel I can do. I’m not sorry for myself; or for the whole world. I’m sorry for the pain I bring, and the black blood I’ll leave behind.', 'I just want to feel something other than despair. As it says on the title.

For years, since I was very young (around 14), I have battled with depression, anxiety and recently PTSD and insomnia. Mental illness is difficult to explain to people, and I have struggled to find reasons to keep going. I had a disability from birth to my early teens, an extremely difficult phase of invasive surgeries and physiotherapy, and a motor vehicle accident that I didn't ask to go through. I don't get better, I don't feel happier, I am just so tired. \\n\\n I am aware that people will be devastated once I am gone. But how can anyone understand this ache, this hopelessness and fatigue? How can I explain that I have been fighting a battle for years, and I no longer wish to fight it? That it isn't one event or circumstance, but rather the cumulation of my physical struggles and the mental diseases that came from them? That I am not dying because I am ungrateful for life, but because I am sick with no recourse? That to face another day in this mind is worse to me than death? I'm not sure. All I know is that I am tired, and all I want is peace.\", 'Despair I’m a 31 year old woman, who’s faced my share of adversity. I’m not naive to the realities of suffering in the world, I am well aware of how ubiquitous it is, and recognize I am not immune. \\n\\nThat being said, I am at an impasse in my life where the idea of finding a legal means to end my life has taken over my train of thought for the past couple of years. I’m so tired of feeling a chronic state of despair. \\n\\nI ask for the suspension of judgement. \\nI come from a large family (10) and am a middle child-\\nI identify as Arab-American, and have faced a horrifying experience at the hands of Federal law enforcement when I was 14 (myself and my family) that included breaking into our home and brandishing guns against my siblings and I, all of which were minors and one vulnerable adult brother with schizophrenia. My parents aren’t educated, as they lived under a military occupation in their country of origin, and my siblings and I were all born here in the US. \\n\\nI carried a phobia of law enforcement and a feeling of alienation as an American citizen for over a decade\\nSince that incident and tried my hand in therapy for it. I was referred to a psychiatrist who shared my cultural background for greater ‘compatibility’ and she ended up being an unethical practitioner who exploited me by Soliciting private sessions with my family outside the clinic I went to see her in, in exchange for funds. Illegal, which I didn’t know, and I later found out she was being investigated by the clinic when she ended up working with my family one-on-one and prescribing a slew of medications to treat them. The prime reason I saw her was to address my phobia of law enforcement trauma and witnessing the degeneration of my eldest brother from schizophrenia since I was 13. She convinced me she could ‘help’ us, used our finances, and over medicated my siblings, violated hipaa by discussing the privacy of others in our community, and even between my family and our private sessions. \\n\\nMy sister was given a cocktail of medication that elicited a psychotic break (we found out later that she was not supposed to be given the combination she had and her PCP didn’t understand how the pharmacy missed this red flag- my sister had picked it up from different pharmacies not knowing the contraindications). \\n\\nAll this time, this psychiatrist intimidated me and my family, and used us long enough to give her the funds she needed to lease her own clinic (my brother was a business owner and supplied the funds- we had no idea we were being conned). \\n\\nThe psychiatrist absolved herself of responsibility of my sister’s psychosis, and my brother with schizophrenia had a massive psychotic break (when he was stable at that point, but she wanted to try him on new medication to ‘heal’ him). When I called the psychiatrist to tell her what was happening, she blamed my mother for giving my brother the medication the psychiatrist  *specifically* prescribed, and instructed my uneducated mother to give him and said, “Your mother is irresponsible and not educated, I am not responsible- she shouldn’t have given it to him. Take him to the hospital, I have nothing to do with it.” \\n\\nI was in shock, despair, and went to the clinic to confront them and the clinic directors were visibly shaking. I found out they themselves were having legal troubles with her; they told me they genuinely didn’t know she did this to me and legally weren’t allowed to tell patients why the clincian was being let go from their clinic. They gave me the medical board of practice information, I tried contacting them, but the amount of evidence I needed to submit I didn’t have available other than my testimony and something called a “retainers agreement “ I signed, and the medication we were all prescribed. My siblings were too psychotic for me to compartmentalize. \\n\\nSeeing the state of brokenness it left my family, I couldn’t summon the energy to pursue anything the route of the medical board. I was absolutely traumatized. I tried to reinstate my brother back into a hospital, and they kept rotating him through student doctors, and he kept regressing while still unstable, until I found one after two years. My sister however, spent her twenties (she is two years older than me) vacillating in a series of psychotic breaks that were exacerbated from MVA’s, and TBI’s that resulted in compounded her already fragile mental state. \\n\\n\\nI wanted to die. I was suicidal for years and had to fight to reclaim my will to live. \\n\\nPrior to all this, we lost our home when I was 13, lost my father to incarceration for underreported sales tax (his lawyer defended against the accusations of him sending remittances to terrorist organizations when he sent money to his family overseas, and the judge ruled in my fathers favor and exclaimed there was absolutely no evidence and that the motive was prejudicial), though he still spent a year incarcerated for under reporting taxes, and then took care of my brother who had series of psychotic breaks. \\n\\n\\nI’m 31, and I I’m so tired. I found an emergency clinic after my experience with this psychiatrist when I was 23, to treat me for my suicidal ideation because I lost my will to live and couldn’t control the absolute despair within me and uncontrollable crying. I was afraid to leave my room for a month, and was afraid of being awake, and afraid to sleep because of nightmares. It hurt to live. It was horrifying. \\n\\nAfter a decade, my brother and sister are relatively ‘stable’, and in that emergency mental health clinic I attended, the therapist stabilizing me somewhat and addressed why I didn’t reach out to law enforcement- because of my earlier adverse experience with federal agents, which the original psychiatrist I saw knew of and recognized I had a massive fear of anything criminal justice related, hence why she exploited me knowing I was traumatized and blocked them out as a coping method. \\n\\nThroughout all this, since I was 16 and old enough to work and drive, I coped by working out religiously for at least 5 days a week, and pursued a degree in psychology to better educate my family about my brothers illness since my parents had a middle school level of educational attainment and didn’t understand what was happening. When my sister had her psychotic break around my senior year of college, in which she accused me of conspiring to kill her, I was left traumatized and couldn’t finish my last semester because I couldn’t believe another sibling was falling prey to the cruelty of a mental illness so severe. \\n\\nThree other brothers had car accidents that crippled one for the first three years after his accident (January 11, 2011). \\n\\nMy sister with the psychosis, had a MVA (January 23, 2016) that broke the entire right side of her body’s bones, and left her with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma, making her even more delusional. She was in a coma for 3 weeks, and in ICU for another 3, of which I dropped everything and stayed with her in the hospital advocating for her care.\\n\\n\\nMy father is terminal with cancer currently, and has been battling it during my 20’s, concurrently with my sisters battle with psychosis. We are approaching the last couple months of his life. \\n\\nThroughout this experience, I had a close friend for six years in my 20’s who I discovered was a vulnerable narcissist, and was socially comparing her life to mine as a means to make her feel better about herself (she has a masters in English education). When she couldn’t use me as supply (I’d ask for space to ground myself and try to cope with the pain of my family’s illnesses), she would victimize herself and start to passively aggressively emotionally abuse me and use my empathy against me. \\nTwo of her sisters exposed her and called her out, because they respected and loved me, after they found out what she was doing. I couldn’t understand the level of evil someone could descend to, knowing what she knew about how I was exploited, and what I had gone through (she hadn’t gone through serious adversity, but was a fragile personality- though, I found later her sisters told me she was jealous of my resilience, because she was more sensitive to crumbling under pressure- this enraged her). \\n\\nI am so tired. I just wanted to be a good person in the world, and pursue my love for higher education. I’m mentally not the same, not capable of the same abilities that I felt I used to possess. I feel distorted and grieve the loss (somewhat) of some aspects of my mental capacities (memory, concentration, attention, interruption of train of thought & how I speak even). \\n\\nForgive me everyone, I just needed to put this somewhere. I’m so tired.', \"Life is but meaningless cycle of anguish and despair I asked out my best friend and she rejected me. She was the only constant in my life that distracted me from all the drakness.

This is the pain we’ve all felt for such a long time and It leaves me to think about my own life and actions.\\n\\nI’m twenty two years old. I dropped out of college after having a mental breakdown at 19. It was a culmination of coming to grips with being groomed by someone I trusted in my teens, a toxic on again/off again relationship with my Ex, coming to grips with my lack of sexuality and how many people didn’t believe Demisexuality to be a thing, as well as manipulation of someone I saw as a friend.\\n\\nI made my last attempt on my life. In my car, but I was so terrified of hurting someone else with my original plan that I returned home and turned off the lights.\\n\\nI overdosed and no one in my family did anything about it.

First rounds on me.', \"Graduation ceremony sweet talks triggering depression, despair and self-loathing It's the end of spring and people have been graduating from high school and having their ceremonies and parties. The media is literally packed with sentimental and grand talks about the achievements of these young people and what exciting possibilities the future has for them etc. There's also concerned speculation about how corona restrictions have been affecting the spirits and mental health of the youth - They are the future, after all, and fragile important creatures!\\n\\nI'm post-college of six years. I usually don't care about the high school graduation hype, about 95% of people graduate in my country so it's not that big of an achievement really, more of a rite of passage. I've thought it's mostly about older people reminiscing their own youth or parents sentimental about their kids growing up, not to mention teens thinking their every single grade has some sort of deep effect on their life.\\n\\nBut this year I just got pissed, then sad, then pissed again. What future, what exciting opportunities? Did I miss it somehow? It's been nothing but misery and rejection and struggle and numbness for me, and not for lack of effort on my part. I look at these kids (i.e. myself as a young person) and think how naive they are, how they have no idea what abyss lies ahead of them. Then I remember, hey, these are normal people and not sad losers like me. They will dream of becoming veterinarians and engineers and lawyers and they'll do just fine. They won't become suicidal by the age of 30 after a string of meaningless and straining minimum wage part time jobs.\\n\\nThen I think about the general concern over these young graduates. I feel ashamed, as if nobody is really concerned about me and I don't somehow deserve it. After you go to college and graduate it's all just silent lonely struggle. You are expected to succeed, or fail in silence. You lack the security of older people and the protection aimed at younger people. You are nothing, no one.\\n\\nThanks for letting me vent.

However, this pressure has really been chipping away at my self-esteem and overall happiness. Recently, I’ve lost all hope in a good future.

My problems are less significant than many others but I'm an obsessive person, and I feel like nothing I want I can ever have. I can read the self-help books about learning to not give a fuck but in the end my mind isn't receptive to any of it. This year I have gotten into university, and for a while things were great, but now ever since a bad test I feel like I have fucked everything up beyond repair and I should have known better. I can't stop the constant cycle of anxiety at the prospect of failing, repeating or dropping out and wasting all these 5 months of my short life. I'm in the middle of exams and feel like I'm drowning. This semester at university I fell into limerence (very extreme crush) with a guy I can never have, and that was torturing me before, but now the prospect of never seeing him again is tearing me apart. Even if I passed we may never be in the same classes again. This semester I've also been working on music, an experimental electric guitar album that I created and finished and have been proud of as a means of creative expression. I wasn't making it for attention, but now I feel like I've got nobody to share it with and it'll just die forgotten like me. Nobody in the world has even listened to it. it hasn't helped anyone or done anything like i hoped. so what's the point except my own egoism. \\n\\nLife has me doubting why I've been even trying. If I can't have university, or my limerent object, or music,  the three things that make me happy I just can't see the point. I used to try and live to help others but I haven't done anything for anybody, and i usually just drag them down. I've told my family  about my chronic despair and to some extent they are supportive but I feel like I can't even possibly receive support for this. Despite that I'm financially ok and have some support, my mind only wants the things I will likely never have and the pain of being without them is crucifying. Besides this, I've also been dealing with loneliness and low self-esteem. Yes, I live a privileged life but what's the point of having a rich life if you have no reason to live. I get that I should wait and see what happens but all i want is to walk into the ocean and never come back. the inevitable pain of defeat is going to destroy me anyway. i thought this year i had hope, but it was short-lived and didn't appreciate it while I had it. i'm not even saying i want to be anything. i just don't want to be human. and all i want is attention.\", \"Want to cry of despair.

I’ve been dealing with depression and social anxiety/phobia for about six to seven years now. I’ve considered suicide many times in the past, but only recently have I started thinking about how I’d carry it out. I’ve chosen my method, but instinctual fear is still preventing me from doing it for now. I want to get help more than anything, but my anxiety prevents me from doing so.\\n\\n(I apologize for the following wall of text, but there’s a lot I want to say.)\\n\\nI was homeschooled from kindergarten through high-school due to the schools around my area being rather trashy, so I didn’t get to socialize with kids my own age until I was a teenager and got more involved in my hobbies. I eventually lost interest in my hobbies due to the depression. Or maybe I was never interested in them to begin with and I was only faking interest because of my parents insistence that I do something other than sit on my computer all day, I don’t know anymore. Nowadays I don’t have any friends that I keep in touch with other than my group of online friends who I’ve been gaming with since early adolescence. I should also mention I’m addicted to video games to some extent, probably because it’s the only social outlet I have left.\\n\\nI’m also a perfectionist; I can’t handle any sort of rejection, criticism, or anything negative from another person without feeling crushed to the point of wanting to kill myself. If I do something wrong and somebody points it out to me, even if they only mean to help me, I immediately fall into a crushing depressive episode. It can be the smallest, most insignificant thing in the world, and I’ll make up a reason to immediately abandon whomever I’m with at the time just so I can sulk by myself.\\n\\nThe biggest problem is that I’ve never been able to express these feelings to anybody, not even my parents. They can be judgmental and extremely difficult to talk to, and I’ve had some really bad experiences with them in the past regarding my feelings, especially my father. It was around the time my social anxiety and depression really started taking control of my life, so whether there’s a connection there or not, I don’t know. No matter how much I want to get help, I just can’t get myself to tell them about my problems, just because I’m terrified of how they’d react and that I might make my situation worse.\\n\\n(For what it’s worth, I *have* discussed my issues with two of my online friends, but they can only help me so much when they have their own lives to live and are thousands of miles away.)\\n\\nBefore I graduated high school, people constantly asked when I was going to get my driver’s license. I passed the paper exam, got my learner’s permit, (which expired last year sometime I think, so I’ll probably have to take it *again,*) but simply never went back to take the actual driving exam due to my anxiety.\\n\\nOnce I graduated high school, people asked me what I was going to college for. Of course, I had no intentions of going to college; I planned on being dead by the time I turned twenty-one, but I went with it at the time. I said, “Oh, Iunno, I’ll figure it out,” or something to that effect. By the looks on their faces, you would think I’d just admitted to murdering innocent children. Their insinuations were clear as day: “Go to college or get a job, or you’re a loser.” I’d like to think these are just cognitive distortions of mine, but once again, I *know* these people. They *are* generally unpleasant people, (to put it gently,) but even though I reminded myself that, I wanted to hang myself every time I heard that question anyway, and I heard it almost daily for at least a year. I couldn’t handle that kind of pressure, and so I withdrew.\\n\\nMy withdrawal from society and procrastination after high school really put me into a slump. How am I supposed to live like this? Getting older terrifies me, and is one of the reasons the scales are tipping toward suicide more and more every day. I can’t stand looking at myself in the mirror. I have no control over this, and it frustrates me to no end that I can’t shake this feeling that I’m running out of time. I want to do things with my life but I just can’t find the strength to do it.\\n\\nI’d probably try to pursue a career in writing, but I can’t pursue it because of my fears of being criticized. I’d probably be able to manage college if I was able to get psychological help, but because I’m not independent, there’s no way I can get psychological help without my parents’ approval, and I can’t get my parents approval without talking to them about it. And even if I do bite the bullet and talk to them about it, there’s a chance they might invalidate my feelings and deny me my help, and then I’d have to deal with the aftermath of my parents not handling things properly.\\n\\nLike I said, my parents are somewhat old-school and closed-minded; they stigmatize the hell out of everything. They say psychologists are nothing more than scam-artists trying to get money from you, people who take anti-depressants or other medications are pathetic, etc.\\n\\nI’m afraid if I expose my feelings, they might try to kick me out in some kind of ‘tough love’ act in the hopes that it would force me to ‘get over it’ or something, when it would probably only result in tragedy. If I told them “I’m going to kill myself,” they would probably reply with something like “People who kill themselves never say that, they just do it,” or something equally ignorant. Of course, I don’t *know* if something like that would happen, but their track record with this kind of thing is terrible. It seems like every day I start mustering up strength to tell them, I’m reminded in some way of why it might just be the death of me. I just get the feeling that they’re going to fall into denial about it or take the tough love approach, just because they can’t have an unstable son. They care more about me being socially acceptable than my mental well-being. It would be *embarrassing* for them.\\n\\nOn the flip side, I believe my parents do love me as much as they’ve said they do. I know they would never intentionally harm me, but I just don’t think they would understand what I’m going through due to their closed-mindedness, and may react in a potentially destructive way toward me.\\n\\nFinancially, my family is well-off, and my parents plan to pay for my college, but of course, I can’t do anything with it because of my issues, which is the most frustrating part. I have all the opportunity and yet no will to grasp it.\\n\\nSo, my life has devolved into an awful cycle of wanting to try and get help and gain independence, deciding the risks aren’t worth the reward, and then contemplating suicide until I fall asleep. When I wake up, it all starts over. The only time I feel at peace is when I’m dreaming. When I’m forced into social situations, I fake happiness – and after six years, I’ve gotten damn good at it, too.\\n\\nBut I’m tired of faking it. I want out of this. And I will get out, one way or another.\\n\\nThank you for reading all that. I still have more to say, but I feel I’ve hammered out enough for you to get the gist of my situation.

And more nagging. \\n\\n“Why you?”\\n\\nHe excelled academically -“Usually”- because of teachers whose passion and Love let them better understand the complexities of what it means to be human.\\n\\n“See.”\\n\\nHe was taught the miracles of the natural world, and the usefulness of creation. \\n\\n“See.”\\n\\nHe grew this way, with challenges- “screw-ups”-but with few struggles - “coward!”\\n\\n“See.”\\n\\nWithin him, seemingly inexplicably grew a lack of Love for himself -“ingrate!”\\n\\n“See.”\\n\\nWith young adult hood came a shocking understanding of how -“worthless”-the world could be.\\n\\n“Evil is everywhere.”\\n\\nThat naturally brought questions -“fool”-about why things were they way they were.\\n\\n“If not us, the other will rule with cruelty and lies.”\\n\\nHis religion -“its a crutch”- gave him answers through genuine Love, compassion, and interest in his growth as good, honest, and beneficial member of their society.  \\n\\n“There is no other way.”\\n\\nBut, he also learned the price for disbelief was eternal torment in the underworld. \\n\\n“Which you deserve for your sins.”\\n\\nHe saw war, famine, greed and hatred running amock in the world beyond the mountains, even though he -“coward!”- remained safe.  \\n\\n“It will come for you!  Only I can save you.”\\n\\nHe wondered why would the gods allow such suffering.  How they can claim perfectly unconditional Love when they allow the sickness in the world-“they don’t care”.\\n\\nBut the sickness was incurable, and he felt helpless -“weak.”\\n\\nThe nagging voice grew louder, and drowned out all others.  \\n\\nIt made him forget what he was supposed to see. \\n\\nHis self loathing -COWARD!”- grew with his despair.  \\n\\nBut, despite the seemingly ever-present sickness, he prospered -“took!”- and even found Love.\\n\\n“See.” Still as quiet and as gentle as ever.  \\n\\nHe married the most beautiful and selfless woman in the infinitely massive universe -“you can’t understand”- and was blessed with a child, the kind also only heard of in story books -“you aren’t ready.”\\n\\nWith relatively few mistakes, he grew in experience and skill, and was able to use to his abilities to be the man he was supposed to be -“you never earned it.”\\n\\nBut his despair also grew -“YOU ARE WEAK!”- until one day he decided to end his life. \\n\\n“See?”\\n\\nAs he stood by the cliff he asked himself:\\n\\n“Why am I here?”\\n\\n“There is no reason!” The voice said. “You have failed, and you will fail them too.”\\n\\n“See?”\\n\\n“You are sick. They will be better off without you!”\\n\\n“See?” The same quiet and gentle voice was back.  \\n\\n“Step off.  Your worries will die with you.”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\n“See.”\\n\\n“What am I supposed to see?” He begged!\\n\\n“Pain? Suffering? Cruelty? Death?” He sneered.  “I see them every day, and I am to weak and foolish to stop them from destroying my world!”\\n\\n“Them.” In that familiar gentle voice. “Your wife. Your Child.”\\n\\n“HOW COULD THEY LOVE YOU! JUMP!”\\n\\n“See them? Your Mother? Your Father?”\\n\\n“YOU FAILED THEM! JUMP!”\\n\\n“See them.”  It was never actually a question. \\n\\n“Your Brothers. Your Sisters.”\\n\\n“YOU TREATED THEM LIKE DIRT! JUMP!”\\n\\n“See them.”\\n\\n“Your Aunts. Your Uncles.”\\n\\n“YOU DIDN’T EVEN KNOW THEM! JUMP!”\\n\\n“See them.”\\n\\n“Your Friends.  Everyone you know.”\\n\\n“IF THEY KNEW YOU, THEY WOULD HATE YOU TOO! JUMP!”\\n\\n“See.”\\n\\n“HA.”  The voice laughed.  “YOU ARE TOO COWARDLY TO EVEN LOVE YOURSELF!”\\n\\n“NOW STOP BEKNG A COWARD! JUMP!” It hissed malevolently.  \\n\\n“See.”\\n\\n“You were there all along.”\\n\\n“Forgive yourself.  You are Loved and forgiven without condition.  You must Love yourself the same, so you can Love others.”\\n\\n“LIES!” The voice seemed weaker.  \\n\\n“Look and See.”\\n\\nHe opened his eyes and saw his wife and child.  He finally truly saw the way they Loved him, and it was more beautiful than the sunrise!\\n\\n“I See! I SEE!  How did I miss this, when it was here all along?”\\n\\n“BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL WEAK!”\\n\\n“See.” \\n\\nThe Love he had ignored for so long coursed through him, and he wept as he turned from the ledge.  \\n\\n“See.”\\n\\n“THERE IS NO HOPE!  YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME!  THE SICKNESS IS TOO STRONG!”\\n\\n“Keep looking.  It’s there to see, as long as you are willing to look.”\\n\\nHe began walking and kept Seeing more, but the screaming voice was still there.  \\n\\n“See.”\\n\\n“LOVE IS WEAKNESS!  IT HAS NO POWER!”\\n\\n“See.”\\n\\nFear would find ways to explain away what he was seeing, but the quiet voice remained. \\n\\n“See.”\\n\\nAgain, he decided he must die, so he began killing himself.  \\n\\nIt was a slow and painful process.  \\n\\nThe part of himself that he was killing didn’t want to die.\\n\\nIt bit and thrashed like a wild animal with its foot in a snare.  \\n\\nIt took constant effort, and constant refocusing, but the Love he saw filled him, and allowed him to push on. \\n\\nThis took away fear’s power, but slowly.  \\n\\nSometimes the fear rushed back with renewed strength, hissing wildly, and at times nearly toppling his newly built defenses. \\n\\nBut now, they were tall enough that he could see past the attack. \\n\\n“Now you See.” The quiet voice said in it’s unfaltering tone.  \\n\\n“If you keep looking, you will See through every moment, good and bad, beautiful and hopeless, painful and horrific, and you will find it.”\\n\\n“Can you See?”', \"Downward spiral into despair In the course of the last 21 days, I've lost my job of 22 years and just recently, the girl I loved.

I'm an unemployed college graduate. All I did in college was come in and went to my classes, shutting myself away in my room.

I can't find work that doesn't require a car and I don't think my life will get better. The thought of death as an escape keeps growing on me.

I won\\'t likely do anything, but I think the causes of the despair need to be addressed.  Help? I typed out a whole personal history but then the keyboard\\'s tendency to activate alt and ctrl commands without touching either key resulted in its deletion.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSuffice to say, I don\\'t know what to do with my life and can\\'t imagine a positive future from my current path, but also don\\'t feel like I\\'ll have a choice about this future because the path will keep me on it due to the unbeatable advantages of staying the course.  I\\'m 22, in grad school doing a master\\'s in an environmentally related science, have a feminist conscience that makes me want to achieve positive things for women (ie not be a secretary or housewife or other stereotypically female job) and always liked humanities better but pursued science because it seemed like a better idea.  Had planned on going on to be a professor (after PhD) but have doubts now.  Socially awkward/shy, so don\\'t feel confident about networking/spotaneous career orchestration (ie without a plan working toward).  Don\\'t want a life that is meaningless or unsatisfying, but feel like I\\'m heading that way and can\\'t do anything about it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEdit: Wanted to add a bit more detail about why I feel constrained, but crap the keyboard got me again.  I need to figure that out but this is a borrowed computer.  Basically the reason I feel trapped is that I want to minimize the elimination of potential options, which results in taking the safest, most vulnerable path (the path that would be eliminated by pursuing other options).  So any deviation from this path is risky because while that path is potentially highly unsatisfying, it is also better than many other possibilities, and never precludes the other options.  So here we have another case of cowardice on my part in not taking any risks.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdit: So I was thinking about this scenario and when I tentatively \"decided\" to myself to not continue with a PhD, it was like a weight was lifted.  I thought to myself, I can do anything I want at that point!  I\\'m not tied down or limited or anything and I don\\'t have to worry about the long-term longevity because I can change jobs relatively easily.  I think that I\\'m likely to waver on this, feeling that getting a doctorate would be more impressive, and thinking of the fun and rigor of doing research/being a scientist, but I will try to remember the feeling I have now and hopefully make the right choice when it comes down to it.  This kind of thing is why I don\\'t think I\\'m depressed as such; I think I just have a weight on my mind.  I also put entirely too much weight onto the opinions and perceptions of others, and should try to avoid that.

Recently I was deeply in love this girl and we saw each other briefly.  We slept together several times.  She's the sweetest, most beautiful girl I've ever known.  And last year she just kind of shut me out and started giving me the cold shoulder.  I thought maybe it was because we work together or something.  I always held onto a sliver of hope, but for the most part it sent me into a downward depression, to the point that I started acting out at work and doing stupid things.

And he kind of swooped in and now they're dating.  And now I have to show up at this place every fucking day of every fucking week and see them, hear them, be around them.  I just can't take it.

It might be hard to hide all the negative emotions away but I could try, after prepping myself and a couple of deep breaths. The only regret would probably be I never get to let him know what is causing me so much pain and he probably would never know the real reason why I end up killing myself. \\n\\nOr should I first pretend nothing happened and after a casual chat bring it up? This probably wouldn't guarantee he know the real reason either since I'll have to decide how and to what extent to disclose based on his reaction.

Tired of failing. Once full of hope, now sinking in despair. Oh, that I could die in my sleep and be free to fly... First time posting on Reddit -- here goes nothing.\\n\\nMy life seems ideal. I am a 24yo medical student. To the world, I am the pinnacle of success. From the outside looking in, it appears to those around me that I have the world at my feet. No one knows that I am crumbling behind the facade.\\n\\nI learned that I suffer from ADHD after almost failing out of medical school multiple times in the year and a half that I've been here. Medical school, for me, has been a never-ending cycle of wanting so badly to be better, trying, failing, and barely making it to the next course. Prior to my diagnosis (3 months ago), I became resigned to the fact that I just wasn't going to make it. The only thing that has sustained me to this point has been my relationship with a classmate who's become my lover. We became close because she was also diagnosed with ADHD last semester after experiencing uncharacteristic school failure. We bonded through that experience. I hadn't known that anyone could relate to my private suffering. Suddenly, I wasn't alone. She was a wellspring of hope -- a reason to believe that I could get past my ailment someday.\\n\\nShe motivated me to change. I was on winter vacation over the last few weeks and spent the whole break reading up on how to be better at life despite having a brain that makes it difficult to do so. I read books, articles, Reddit posts -- everything I could find. I absorbed it all and became extremely optimistic about the possibility of becoming a new man. \\n\\nI've been back at school for just two days and am fucking up all over again. The same failure patterns that I've always struggled with are already taking shape. What's worse is that I can see my lover beginning to flourish.

Two weeks ago I was hospitalised for strong suicidual feelings and a migraine that wouldn't go away. This is my first hospitalisation.

But around 4 weeks ago, I broke down completely. But now I have upped my meds, I have noticed my suicidal feelings have gone but the suicidal thoughts are still nonstop. I guess there is no emotion attached to the thoughts, they are simply thoughts. I guess I don't really know my question but is having constant suicidual thoughts normal? Is it just like having thoughts about food? If thoughts are simply coming and going... eiee.. Do you think suicidal feelings are way more serious? \\n\\nThanks so much everyone <3\", 'My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal) This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I don’t even care of no one reads it. \\n\\nSo quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.\\n\\nFlash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. \\n\\nOne of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)\\n\\nI won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. \\n\\n__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.\\n\\n__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. \\n\\n__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. \\n\\n__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.\\n\\n__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?\\n\\n__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?\\n\\n__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.\\n\\n__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.\\n\\n__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?\\n\\n__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.\\n\\n__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??\\n\\n__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.\\n\\n__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!\\n\\n__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”\\n\\n__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!\\n\\n__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?\\n\\n__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!\\n\\n__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.\\n\\n__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.\\n\\n__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?\\n\\n__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.\\n\\n__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)\\n\\n__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.\\n\\n__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?\\n\\n__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.\\n\\n__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.\\n\\n__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?\\n\\n__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._\\n\\n__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!\\n\\n__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?\\n\\n__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?\\n\\n__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.\\n\\n__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???\\n\\n__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.\\n\\n__Him:__ ....\\n\\n__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?\\n\\n__Him:__ ...\\n\\n__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.\\n\\n__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.\\n\\n__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. \\n\\n__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?\\n\\n__Me:__ no.\\n\\n__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.\\n\\n__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?\\n\\n__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.\\n\\n__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.\\n\\n__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__\\n\\n__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?\\n\\n__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.\\n\\n__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?\\n\\n__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.\\n\\n__Me:__ literally what you said.\\n\\n__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. \\n\\n__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.\\n\\n__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!\\n\\nAnyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._\\n\\n__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?\\n\\n__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!\\n\\n__Me:__ lol.\\n\\nI’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.\\n\\nHonestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.\\n\\nI know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. \\n\\nFor anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. \\n\\nAnyway rant over.

Around 7 months ago, I found websites and forums that promised penis size increase and attempted to do these techniques and failed horribly. I have lost so much sensitivity for no reason.

I\\'m only 19 and damaged my penis for life. I\\'m heading to the doctors next friday, but read all on the internet that nerve damage is permanent. In the last 7 months there have been zero improvement in my penis. I can\\'t sleep anymore and can\\'t tell anyone in my life because this is so embarrassing. I\\'ve dropped all my college classes except one and failed that class. This has taken a mental toll in my life and I don\\'t think I can continue any longer. The first time I went to the doctors, they just gave me cialis, if they do it again I think I\\'m done with life. I can\\'t continue life like this, every time I pee, take a shower, wake up with a weak erection, every time I walk I get reminded with the lack of sensations from my groin, I get reminded that I fucked everything up due to my insecurities. I have shut myself off from the world in the last 7 months. I just stay in bed all day or watch this livestreamer xqc which helps me forget until he ends stream.

The first time I was hit with that stereotype was in 5th grade I remember that girl that said I didn\\'t have a penis because i was asian. That terrified 9 or 10 year old me. Yeah and of course i get hit that stereotype in middle school as well with more stuff like I eat dog and what not. Flash forward to highschool, I\\'m in the football locker room with my teammates, went to take a piss at the urinals, my douche of a teammate stares at my dick while pissing says I have a pencil dick and tells my other teammates and make more racist jokes. Now flash forward to college during the corona virus shit. Asians getting blamed and shit, I was filling up my gas and this dude yells at me \"these small dicked asians ruin everything\". I can\\'t say shit except \"shut the fuck up bitch\". Later stumbled upon penis enlargement exercises and gave myself nerve damage. Your penis is fine they way it is, if it gets hard thats all you need. You shouldn\\'t be turned down by a life partner over your penis size. I\\'ve dated 3 girls and none of them complained.

I\\'m sorry.\" I was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so I ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. I beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. I called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. She was vomiting everywhere. The paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and I sped to the ER right behind them. They gave me a number to call in the ER to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they\\'re doing their best to stabilize her. She was vomiting so much that they couldn\\'t pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. Hours went by that felt like days, and the Dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she\\'d either be \"brain dead\" or have brain damage. I fell apart. My dad was there to hold me up, but I felt all the wind leave my lungs. My dad took the phone and talked to the Dr some more and then he picked me up like I was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. He said there\\'s nothing we can do here. She\\'s in ICU, she\\'s gonna pull through, but we\\'re waiting on the CT scan. So he drove us home, I passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. I threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. They actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn\\'t require inpatient treatment of any kind. They discharged her to go home. I was speechless. I called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. She refused and said she just wanted to go home. Now, we have 2 autistic children.

I\\'m seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but I\\'ve been at home on bed rest since May 17th with an ice bag on my head. Times are really tough. But now they want her to go home and for me to keep a \"suicide watch\" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. To find her outpatient therapy. To follow up with her psychiatrist and PCP. I can barely make myself a sandwich right now. So we brought her back home and the universe came calling. It was her psychiatrist who she\\'s been seeing for 17 years. He said that if she doesn\\'t follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. At that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. I got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and I haven\\'t heard from her since. I\\'m lost.

Earlier this year I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis which has reduced the already-damaged quality of my life significantly. Day by day it's getting harder to sleep or to do anything without having the sense of an impending doom in my mind. I spend my days without doing anything and being angry and irritated at everyone around me. I just finished my graduation with good marks and am waiting for my postgraduation admissions. Academic achievements used to feel meaningful and now they just don't. Accomplishments don't feel satisfying at all. \\n\\nTo add to all this, my girlfriend cheated on me two months before.

And with terrible lack of sleep came terrible realisations. Anything that I held close to me once now feels so distant. Everything I was once good at, I am not now. I am not a positive factor in the lives of any of the people that are dear to me. And for the first time I felt like ending things. I couldn't do it and I don't think I would do it also.

This may not be a lot for other people, but for me, it's way too much and causes me so much anxiety (I have GAD) I don't know how people do this many or even more courses. I can't take it, I can't keep up with the courses and a lot of my courses require a higher average then I'm used to. I've been out of school for 3 and a half years and I can't do this.

With my dad paying for my college, so I don't know what to do.\", 'I just want this anxiety gone I have been living with this thought for a very long time, but these past 2 months have been awful for me. Right now I’m 15(F), school had started way earlier than the normal time, and they started off by giving out too much work on the first 2 weeks, which put me under a lot of stress, which might’ve been the indicator that this was gonna be the end of me. Exams start tomorrow after they’ve been finished only a month ago, I have too many portfolios and group projects to complete and I have not been able to do anything about it. This school has started to make my life a living hell, to the point where I don’t wanna live anymore. There are these stairs that are boarded with some large pillars, but these pillars leave huge gaps, enough for a person to fit through and jump off. They aren’t high enough to kill me but I could at least get fractured or get unconscious. Or maybe if I land on my head it could kill me, I don’t know. Anything better than attending another day in this hellhole. I sound like I’m making a huge deal out of this, but this school has been driving me crazy ever since I started attending my courses. They started on January every Saturday, and they had been awful since they often gave out a lot of homework and lasted from 12 to 6, and on a Saturday. I was already experiencing too much stress from my previous school, and this was just fueling it. Now, take all this work, but now make it 5 days a week, make it into group projects, waste your Saturday on some course and get completely demotivated to do anything. It’s in the afternoon too which wastes a lot of my energy, everyday I feel like a lazy piece of shit, if anything good happens to me then it gets completely drown out by the fear or anxiety of responsibilities. Even when I don’t have anything to do. Group projects give me more pressure since many people are relying on me to do my work. It’s not like I can ask to work alone, teamwork is like the school’s main thing. The way that exams are starting again after I was just done with them doesn’t help either. I don’t trust my current psychiatrist, I was so used to the other one of my previous school, since she was very nice and supportive, I get emotional thinking of her and the times she had helped me. I don’t trust this guy enough though, so it’s hard to get attached to him, so far he hasn’t been very supportive, he mainly asks questions but I think that’s about it. I miss my old psychiatrist so much. My family doesn’t care about this anxiety, they care more about my academic studies. The only source of support I have left are my friends on Discord, but only sometimes cause many times they ignore my vent messages. I just want this pain to end, I have this gut wrenching feeling in my chest that doesn’t go away, I wanna stab this part of my chest. There have been many thoughts roaming around my head about how I wanted to die. Maybe sneaking in to consume the highly toxic chemicals in the school labs, or jump off somewhere high, the closest I’ve been to a successful suicide attempt is by tying my neck with a piece of ribbon, twice. My family knows about this, they caught me one time trying to post something here, instead of supporting me, they started blaming me, calling me a coward, yelling at me on how I need Jesus and how this sub is filled with mentally ill individuals. Sometimes I feel like I have no one to turn to. This school has ruined my life, I wanna die so this pain can just go away. I’m considering tying up a ribbon in my neck again tonight, this time I’ll try not to take it off. I’m so tired of living like this', '\"anxiety isn\\'t that serious\" my ass i resent everyone that has ever contributed to the mainstream media\\'s dumbing down of anxiety and related disorders because holy shit, my ocd in particular is ruining my life. i\\'m constantly having panic attacks and heart palpitations that convince me i\\'m dying. i have no social life because i can\\'t shake the feeling that everyone around me hates me, thinks i\\'m weird, or wants me dead. *i\\'ve* wanted myself dead for a hot minute thanks to it-- started when i was around 8 or 9, am 20 now. to be clear ocd is not my only mental health problem but it\\'s one of the few i have dxed and there are no professionals in my area i can see for the other ones that won\\'t suck my fucking bank account dry.\\n\\nthought this was going to be the year i get better. everything\\'s just getting worse. i have almost no friends left on campus, i have 0 clue what i\\'m going to do with my degree when i graduate (bio ba looking @ going into research-- extremely competitive field and i definitely don\\'t feel like i\\'m smart enough for it), and recurring health issues make it so any money i save up gets spent twice over to deal with it.\\n\\njust as shit starts to look up, i now have fucking *covid* thanks to my boss, and being sick is preventing me from leaving my room completely until sunday at the *very least* (i am writing this on a thursday, and got sick tuesday. was most likely infected monday as well fwiw). i\\'m stuck in a cramped ass dorm room with windows that won\\'t open and no matter how i try to distract myself, i keep getting pummeled with anxious & ocd-based thoughts. thoughts about how i\\'m going to die like this, how it\\'s going to be painful, how none of my coworkers and friends are going to care when i\\'m gone -- i do every trick in the book to de-escalate, deconstruct, and ignore them, and nothing FUCKING WORKS ANYMORE.\\n\\ni\\'d say i\\'m in hell but this might actually be worse.\\n\\nif it weren\\'t for the laundry list of complications that come with doing it -- namely the fact that i don\\'t have a method or way of sorting out my final affairs myself so my family doesn\\'t have to -- i\\'d absolutely be dead right now. i\\'m fucking tired of this. i used to be so smart and so productive and i used to have so many friends and loved ones -- now look at me. i feel like a caricature of a mentally ill person, like what you\\'d see on one of those bullshit subreddits made to fakeclaim internet strangers with \"weird\" symptoms. i genuinely can\\'t do ANYTHING without second-guessing myself and having a whirlwind of exhausting thoughts that suck the life and fun out of everything i do and i am at the point where death itself IS the only way i\\'m going to get relief.\\n\\nthis rant isn\\'t going anywhere. just needed to get all this off my chest.', \"My anxiety is killing me I'm constantly anxious. My meds don't help. None of the meds help. They just make it so I can't sleep. One made me unable to sleep for almost 3 full days. I had to take a tylenol pm and a valium in order to sleep. \\n\\nI'm anxious about getting a remote job. I have to take care of my mother every day but don't get paid because she was retired before her strokes that turned her back into a 12yo. So I need a job I can be home and do. But I don't have any college degree. I worked retail for the last 10 years since I was 20. I'm too old to go back to school. I'm not good with people. I'm not good at math. I get so anxious about phone calls I want to throw up. But if I don't get a job I'm going to lose my Healthcare. Even the idea of writing a resume gives me anxiety tummy for days. \\n\\nMy boyfriend is afraid of commitment, and that makes me so anxious I want to die. I have been raped and abused in the past, so I'm terrified to try to date again. I don't want anyone but him, and I've never been more sure of anything than he's the one, but he can't even commit to a weekend trip away. He still has his wedding ring tattoo from his ex-wife. It makes me worry he's still in love with her. And wonder if that's why he won't commit to me. I'm anxious that I'm not good enough or pretty enough or thin enough for him. I know he likes busty petite blondes, which I am not. He started working overnights 6months ago so I never get to talk to him. He wakes up, eats and showers, goes to work, is too busy at work for more than a quick ❤️ emoji. He doesn't get to take his lunch, which I'm awake for anyway, so I can't even talk to him during that. Then he gets home and goes to sleep. On his 2 nights off I usually go over for 1 of them. I live an hour away so he usually wakes up at 5 or 6pm and then I drive the hour there. We're awake together for a few hours and then I pass out. When I am awake with him I'm massaging him for hours because of his chronic pain. I don't mind doing it but i worry that and sex are the only reason I'm kept around. Then when I wake up I have to rush home to take care of my mom. His other night off I usually get like 3 or 4 messages from him and that's it. He has adhd so he forgets his phone exists and so he forgets I exist. He gets too into making music or watching stuff about space. I know he's not cheating because his mom lives with him while she gets her green card. And she's very religious and wouldn't tolerate him committing adultery.\\n\\nOne of my best friends suddenly dropped off the face of the earth, turned off his cell service, deleted all his social media, quit all his gaming platforms.... I have no idea if he's alive or dead and no way to contact him. He lives across the country and I never met or talked to any of his family. \\n\\nMy mom had knee replacement surgery in December and still can barely walk. She's had physical and occupational therapy in a rehab center, at home, and next week we start out patient. If she never walks again I'm going to be stuck here forever taking care of her. My dad won't retire. He's working full time still, and does usually like 5 hours of side jobs after that. So he essentially comes home, eats dinner, and goes to bed. I'm stuck. She won't do her exercises at home. She won't walk unless it's to the bathroom. And then she waits until the last minute because she doesn't wanna walk any more than she has to. So she's constantly wetting and soiling herself which means more laundry for me to do. I'm the only one who does laundry or dishes or takes care of the dogs. I try to clean but my dad's a hoarder so the house is full of his shit. And if I throw anything away he either digs it out of the trash or yells at me about how important that item was for something. If I do clean he never cleans up after himself so whatever I cleaned gets trashed in like a day or two. I have to force my mom to take showers because it's so tiring for her. Plus her strokes made her think some kpop guy is in love with her so I find her messaging scam accounts every other week. No matter how many times I explain that they aren't him she still does it. No matter how much I tell her it's hurting me that she won't stop- she keeps doing it. She tried to give them $5k and I had to stop it. \\n\\nThe only good things in my life are the dogs, the cat, the volunteering with animals I do once a week. It's unpaid and they can't afford to pay me. It's also the only time I get to see it talk to my best friend of 20 years. Or just sit in quiet. And my ~12 hours with my boyfriend, a portion of which I'm asleep during. Because being next to him makes me feel calm when nothing else does. But he won't even say he'd like to live with me eventually because his ex- wife fucked him up so bad he's afraid of commitment to the extreme. \\n\\nI never get a break from the anxiety. I get like 5 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky. When I do sleep it's anxiety dreams or nightmares about my few supports leaving me. I don't really eat unless my dad brings home takeout or my bf buys me dinner on our night together. The energy it takes to make myself food just isn't there. I already have to make every meal for my mom and the pets. I've had baby carrots or toast for dinner more times than I can count. I can't enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. The anxiety screams at me the whole time that i should be getting a job or cleaning or laundry or anything else. It's always in my head. Screaming at me that the only way out is to die. That I'll never be anything more than this hamster on a wheel. Nothing helps. Nothing fixes it. I just sit here and cry, and I feel guilty for doing that because it's not productive. I have AuDHD but my insurance won't pay for me to get diagnosed and it's $7.5k for me to get official testing without accepted insurance. So I have no meds for that. I feel like my heart is going to give out every night as I sit there and look at my life. Almost every choice I've ever made was wrong. I was supposed to kill myself when I turned 18 but I chickened out. Then at 20, 22, 25, 28, 30... I just can't do it. Too many people need me and I'm so tired. I'm so so so tired. Nothing helps. I'm stuck in fucking eternal hell. The only way out is to die.\", 'anxiety Never been diagnosed with anything bc ive never seen psychatrist but i always had a hard time with stress and anxiety.

When we could barely afford a state univ. Sister never worked real 'part time', the had posh part times like teaching SAT class in parents' country for rich kids for *a mont*h for like over *5 grand.* My younger brother never worked a part time and now parents are paying 100% for his law school.\\n\\n\\nI am 100% on student debt which is okay since it's my 2nd time in undergrad college(fucked up grad school due to severe  anxiety and clinical depression). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEven with my severe social anxiety(lifelong selective mutism, still have trouble simply going outside), I wanted to work a parttime like many kids, so in the past, even if for a few days, I attempted Mcdonalds, a convenience store in the busiest intersection in my college town, and as a last resort overnight shifts at a sorting facility. (Which often makes the news for being brutally physically demanding, even for healthy men in their 20s that they quit after one shift) I worked the most at the sorting facility cuz I didn't have to talk much, though sometimes people yelling at me scared me. I couldn't walk properly for 3 days after one shift. Like I couldn't bend my legs. And now I'm constantly doing online surveys for the tiny amount.\\n\\n\\n\\n And last semester I got like 80 USD from school for placing 2nd place in the whole univ for an English competence exam.

Sister has had over 10 boyfriends, as she is tall and pretty from my parents spending a fortune for her private basketball lesson when she was in middle school, and expensive braces when when was in elementary school. My brother also had braces. Me? I didn't care much about my teeth but mother teased me my teeth looked like a farmer's every. Fucking. Time. She saw me all through my 20s, so I finally broke down and asked for braces since by then I was so self conscious about my teeth and looking like a duck, plus I was having physical difficulties(biting my tongue, mouth, etc). So got mine at 30. And it was way cheaper than both my siblings cuz I didn't need to extract anything. Also while both siblings went to a big dental hospital downtown, I went to a local small dental clinic. My sister got expensive sushi place as a 'reward' each time she went to her dentist as she cried about it hurting. I didn't even think about or want that, I was so grateful for letting me have my braces alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I got upset how she always accused me of 'never earning a cent' so I tried to tell her stop doing that, but she cut me every time until I went into a complete mental breakdown then father gets angry at me for 'yelling' at mother at which point I yelled back with a curse. And now both were not even interested in why I got so upset in the first place.\\n\\n\\nI took the magnets back, and my imnocent brother's presents, because I 'never earned a fucking cent' and threw them away in the trash can.\\n\\n\\nAnd now I want to die.

I desperately want to work, but I am also suffering from panic attacks recently as a hiring company is doing a background check on me and my anxiety has gone off the rails for no reason.\\n\\nI have made a grand total of one friend since leaving high school 12 years ago and I have never ever been in a relationship. I went on one Tinder date years ago and was rejected but just never plucked the coursge to try again. I feel alone, ugly, weak-willed and worthless. And honestly I don't blame society at all, and I don't hate anyone except myself. I have always been a loner and poor at communicating.

However my OCD is back cause of the stress and anxiety and I'm not able to continue. There's severe shaking at night.. don't know who to talk to and feel like ending things.

And now, with the effects becoming more and more apparent (look at how hot it is in the southwest!) my mental health too grows worse. On occasion, I’ve voiced my concerns to others, but these people are ones who don’t spend all their time dwelling on these fears. As such, a simple “oh, it’ll be fine,” isn’t very reassuring. Sure, progress has been made. But it’s not enough. The government will continue to allow soulless corporations ransack and pillage the planet of all natural resources, selfish billionaires funding harmful, planet-killing exploits, and capitalism will continue to destroy everything that the common person needs to survive. Greed will kill us all. And it’s obvious the bad future is the one my generation will inherit (I just turned 18). Others may say that abstaining from the news will help, but even then it won’t provide a complete escape. How can I blame the consistent above-freezing temperatures in the winter and sweltering summers on some anomaly? \\nAnd let’s not forget how climate change deniers are still allowed to express their harmful opinions and influence the impressionable public. Politicians will continue their empty promises, on the right and left, until there is quite literally no more clean air for them to breathe, and are forced to drink the same dirty, rationed water as the rest of us. \\nAnd it will only get worse. The trees will wilt in the summer. The forests will grow silent. The food on our plates will diminish in amount and variety. Gone are the days I will be able to enjoy anything that’s not made of crushed up bugs and soy. \\nAnd my generation is still quite powerless. I can’t do anything. Myself and everyone my age can only sit on our phones or stage an unsuccessful protest. Leaders have never listened to brightly colored signs carried by teenagers, and it seems they never will.\\nIt’s also the little things that trigger this feeling. I have a few good examples of this. When I was a kid, no less than 5 years ago, one of my favorite hobbies was to go looking for salamanders. I’d do it for hours, and I’d find loads of them. Nowadays, it’s much harder. I went looking for a solid 30 minutes one time, and only found two. \\nAs little as 2 years ago I would be greeted by the sounds of crickets and the beautiful flicker of fireflies. Now the night is dead and quiet, and I am afraid this will spell doom for the birds. Wildlife means a lot to me. \\nButter, tomatoes, and certain products are becoming more and more expensive. This is directly the result of climate change induced events. This could play into an Oryx and Crake like scenario, where I am forced to eat mushy paste with an unidentifiable taste, sipping dirty water. \\nSnow in my state (Connecticut) is a rarity. While CT is known for its aptly-named “bipolar” weather, the winters are consistently mild and warm. This January, there was a 2-week stretch of days where it was 40F or above. My friends like the warm weather, but it gets me all kinds of fucked up.\\nMy parents and friends are unaffected and don’t seem to understand. No, my parents aren’t climate change deniers, nor are they rightists. But they DID live for 45 or so years where the earth wasn’t fucked, and had no reason to worry otherwise. The birds tweeted and the food was cheap. Blissful ignorance. At that point, climate change was a far-off concern. I’ve told them about my worries about it (not the suicidal part, I’m NOT going back to a treatment center) but they don’t fully grasp it. No I’ll will toward them, but damn it makes me feel isolated. I don’t tell my friends for fear of being ostracized because of said anxiety. When I go to chat rooms or read articles about this stuff, it’s all the same people with the same feelings. The news fucking kills me. \\nWhile defeatism is harmful, it seems like it’s the only viable option. Why be optimistic about our future? It’d be like hoping a rotting pumpkin could suddenly regenerate, and become a fresh new plant. Or something like that. My point is THERE IS NOTHING TO BE HOPEFUL FOR. \\nI’m close to getting into college, and starting a new chapter of my life. But what good is getting a degree for a job that will have no demand in a now-scarred and broken society? \\nFor a while I have been toying with the idea of taking my life, for a variety of reasons. There was one time when I made a vow that I would do so. It was in January of 2022, on an abnormally warm night. I knew that I didn’t want to live in a bleak, desolate future, one fractured by climate change. I said I’d kill myself 10 years from that date if nothing was done to fix it. \\nThen I thought about cutting it down to 5. \\nNow, I’m thinking sooner. Hell, part of me wants to just get it over with now. I don’t care if there’s nothing after death. I’d be at peace. And my miserable life would end. If anything, I’d be doing myself an act of mercy.\\nThese thoughts come through my head daily. They grow louder, and louder. I’ve even considered to start drafting my will. One of the only things keeping me on this earth is the fear of hurting my family. But this too won’t stop me for much longer. It’s not the ideal solution, but the most sensible one for me.\\n\\nI don’t know what I’m seeking by writing this. Maybe it’ll go mostly unnoticed. At this point I can’t think of any tangible, meaningful reasons not to end it. Most of the things that people say you should live for are tied back to the earth and nature, and if those are gone, what’s the point? Apart from a few positive, very small and localized stories, there is nothing but doom and gloom in the way of climate news. Heat Wave this. Record breaking temperatures that. Food shortages. Refugee crisis. Want to know why you can’t afford that steak? CLIMATE CHANGE. Know why half of the world will be uninhabitable? CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.\\n\\ntl;dr anxiety and grief about the climate and bleak future are making me want to take my own life. I feel hopeless and can’t think of any good reasons why I shouldn’t kill myself.', \"I constantly get anxiety attacks because of most stupid shit ever... I'm 18 male.

My school are great and are doing everything to help me but nothing seems to be working. My anxiety spikes mostly when I’m at school so going to and the thought of it is a real struggle. My parents refuse to homeschool me so I am just getting worse and worse and I can’t see the end. I remember feeling like I wanted to end it all and I found the courage to tell my mum a few months back saying something along the lines of ‘ I can’t do this anymore I need to go to the hospital’ I can’t remember it very well. And she said yes I know but did nothing. The only thing that’s stopping me is my cat not being able to see me anymore and the thought of my loved finding me, combined with the feeling that I’m too scared to do it.

I can never bring up the courage to tell her I have these thoughts and I don’t want to stress her out anymore with her already worried about my anxiety and me loosing out on my education.

I don’t know what to do anymore Sorry for the rant. But I don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m not sociable, and panic in such cases, so I don’t have really many friends. Thank you for even reaching the end. \\n\\nSo, I’ve been struggling with anxiety and suicidal thoughts since I was 14. I tried suicide twice but got scared but the thoughts have always been around. \\n\\nRecently, I (M, 20) decided to talk to my university psychologist cause it got worse. On top of all this, I’m the eldest (responsibilities etc if you know what I mean) and gay and Muslim, and Asian (mental health is like taboo). \\n\\nAnyway, she suggested me a Psychiatrist. I told him everything and he prescribes me Xanax 0.25mg * 3 times a day and Duloxetine. It’s been 3 weeks, I feel the same. The Xanax gives immediate relaxation and curbs my overthinking but I’m scared of getting addicted? My suicidal thoughts are also still there and I just feel like overdosing on Xanax and getting over with it. Why? What do I do? I just feel lost and no clue what to do anymore. Why do I feel like this, even after trying to get help? \\n\\nI have stronger suicidal thoughts. My therapist suggested writing a journal and it’s full of just giving up. I even dropped out of my university, just so I could spend some time with my family cause I kept getting emotional breakdowns and panic attacks when I was away, and I don’t really feel that much different now. Just less panic attacks. Worst part is I have to keep it hidden the way my sexuality is, cause I don’t want my parents to blame each other or themselves.\\n\\nI spoke to my therapist when a fellow redditor spoke to me about how overdosing is a bad sign and I should talk to my therapist about it. They prescribed more duloxetine (2 times now, from once (60MG) so now is 120 MG) and taking 0.5MG Xanax. Am I just going to have to keep taking medications daily just to feel sort of sane or relaxed? The medicine makes me drowsy. Recently, my anxiety seems to have turned to depression. Even things I loved doing before, I get so moody and completely lose the excitement that I’d have for the activity before. I can’t sleep the way I would before. Takes ages to sleep and I wake up all of a sudden, many times in the night. I’m not doing well, have to deal with this all by myself, and really want to give up. At least, I know I tried right? That should surely count for something. \\n\\nAnyways, thanks for hearing the rant. I don’t think anything can possibly help me out at this point really. I’m just done.', 'My anxiety was out of control this past week I have anxiety but this past week was the worst it’s ever been.

Oh well.', 'Anxiety is a monster Hi.\\n\\nThis is a throwaway just because I don’t want someone I know to magically find this.\\n\\nI feel like I’m carrying some massive impossible weight. Every thought just triggers something in me that sends me down a spiral. I feel like nobody wants me around anymore: my parents, my friends, my professors, or even my dog.

Unfortunately I found myself in one of those bad situations this year. I try to keep a positive, “you can do it” mindset but lately i feel horrible frequently. When I was a 6 y/o child, my parents had a nasty alcoholic divorce and my sister and I quickly moved into a more affordable house with my mom. For the next 15 years my Dad would relapse every few years, detox, rehab, and also got remarried 4 times. He was not really there for me and did not teach me much but he was wealthy and occasionally bought me things out of guilt. I lived with my stepdad and mother and my stepdad was abusive and kind of creepy. His own biological children hated him and he would try to do this weird “tough on me” father son bullshit with me as a substitute for not being able to parent his own children. Him and my mom screamed at each other every single day. My mom wished him dead for life insurance money after he survived a car wreck injury free. He would often be weird sexually with my mom making comments and also made very creepy comments to my sister’s girl friends, even offering alcohol to them while they were not 21. and it’s one thing to show mutual affection to your wife but she was disgusted by it. She always said she only stayed for money. He was racist using the hard R frequently and he made my first girlfriend uncomfortable with sexual innuendos. I feel bad for even bringing her around in my teen years but she was my favorite person back then so I loved having her over if it meant avoiding my mom/stepdad at all costs and going straight to my room. Every social or extracurricular situation i tried to engage in during high school was negatively affected by my mom. In sports she would cause drama with the other moms of my peers and tried to get wayyy overly involved in my personal life with peers to the point my friends would get annoyed. I tried community college but i quickly realized i had to get out of that town so i moved to colorado. During my teen years i also developed an on-and-off alcohol/drug habit/addiction to cope and after moving to colorado i got sober. Before i moved to colorado my stepdad told me my mom’s health issues were my fault for financial reasons and that i was killing her. I have been sober almost a year now. But when i lived in colorado my parents would constantly contact me telling me i need to be on medication but I hated every antidepressant i ever tried and i thought i found true permanent serenity out there. I blocked my parents so they started contacting my AA 12 step friends/sponsor on facebook trying to get thru to me. Complete invasion of my life. I blew up on them for this told them i hated them and to leave me the fuck alone. On top of this my roommate got evicted for stealing and breaking things so now I was sober but could not afford rent. I gave up on colorado and moved to the beach. I love being away from my hometown but I’m broke and staying in a homeless shelter. You would not guess it by my sloppy typing on my lunch break but I’m a pretty smart guy. I love to read and write and make music. I am very flawed and hurt though. I walk 3 miles to work and back every day rain or shine. I see no fulfillment in slowly paying off debt in a 9-5 for 10 years just to maybe live a decent life one day. I would love to be self-employed as an artist. I send hate mail to my parents sometimes. It feels like coping or “getting the last word.” I need help but cannot afford it medically. I guess some words of encouragement would help. I hate how my parents get off looking like the good guys. They were so hateful and mean my entire life. Sometimes i get depressed episodes where my body feels heavy, like everything is a drag, and I have gone so far to buy the rope for a noose once. I don’t know if there is a way out of this miserable poverty.', \"i love my life (i don't) (trauma dump) TW child abuse and self harm\\n\\nMy parents made my childhood great. They’d threaten to kill me, threaten to kill themselves, fake their deaths, encourage me to commit suicide. They would hit me, touch and caress me because they knew I hated it, scream and insult me 24/7, throw things at me, threaten me with weapons, kick me out, and told me everyday that if they die or kill themselves it’s my fault. They’d starve me, forcefeed me for hours on end to torture me, try to make me eat rotten food out of the trash, threaten to destroy my belongings, threaten to start abusing me (?), admit that they enjoy seeing me in pain, admit to neglecting and traumatizing me on purpose, tell me that the only reason for me to live is to make them money, threaten me saying that I’ll be kidnapped, trafficked, and killed if I ever leave them. They tell me all the time that people are out to kill me because they want my blood. They’d try to rip my clothes off or force me to strip so they could pick apart how disgusting my body is. They made fun of me for grieving my boyfriend’s death and blamed me for his suicide. Sometimes they’d come into my room in the middle of the night multiple times to remind me of how much they hate me and I’d wake up to them in the middle of yelling at me. They lecture me saying that I should avoid anyone who’s nice to me because you’d have to be dangerously stupid to believe that someone as pathetic as me deserves anything good and that people who abuse me are the ones who are treating me in the way I deserve. They always tell me that I should be thanking them for being amazing parents because they’ve never raped or killed me before. List goes on. They still to this day say I’m the abusive one. \\n\\nSo many times they’ve told me that no matter what happens to me, no matter what I’m going through or how close to death I am, it’ll never be enough for them to care and they will do everything possible to make sure I never get help. My mom has said to me that she wouldn’t intervene when my dad was abusing me because she enjoyed watching it but she never hesitated to defend my brother because she loves him.\\n\\nCountless teachers, counselors, nurses, doctors, etc. have begged my parents to make a safety plan with me to prevent me from killing myself and they always refused. Even when they were told that I will die if they don’t, they’d just reply with “Yeah we know.”\\n\\nMy parents say that to get my phone back, I need to cure 100% of my mental illnesses and if I ever ask for help, they’ll disown me.\\n\\nThey refused to give me medication for months while I was having debilitating psychosis.\\n\\nEvery time I go to the hospital, my parents see this as a chance to find compromising info on me so they can share it with mental health professionals to sabotage my treatment. They get so excited about it too.\\n\\nThe most infuriating part of it all is that every adult I’ve told this to, have sided with my parents and pretty much insinuated that everything is my fault. When my parents found this out, they rubbed it in my face, “See? I told you no one cares about you,” and “You can’t be mad when all of your nurses and doctors believe us.”\\n\\nFor the past week I've been crying for hours every day, mostly at school and no one cares. I come to school everyday with new, large gashes that expose the fat in my arms and none of my teachers care or ask me if I'm okay.

I was like these for 2 days speaking with some doctors saying how urgent sth has to be done, at the same nobody really helped me, also i was underage, soo difficult,\\nAnd the third day i came back from hospital and something happened- I started hearing some strange sound from television- high pitched ones that really bothered me, from this moment on i started thinking that i really fucked it up.\\nI blamed myself and lived a miserable life for some months, then tried to go to different doctors, and then I thought fuck just go on.\\nI mean i had tinnitus all the time but hyperacusis was much worse, what I struggled the most was that in some situation for example me talking face to face with a girl and suddenly my body my brain got blocked because there are some disturbing sounds around and brain goes into defensive mode, sending a lot of blood to legs hands and brain and me staying like a robot not able to say a word in front of this girl, I suffered so much because I couldn’t even express what i feel, I couldn’t express my personality, i felt whatever i say it wasn’t deep it was some reactive words just like a machine, it always used to happen when i go to deeper state of mind and reach my authenticity I become more sensitive and this shitty tinnitus always there, ookay I don’t care stay there, but when sounds around bother then I really can’t stop my body from going to defensive mode, so difficult it is.\\nMy only dream is to be able to express myself and to be my authentic version my real me\\n\\nSo i started intruding myself back to normal life, actually Erasmus projects really helped as first time my life i found people who understand me except for one of the doctors that also has this condition. Well basically i started thinking it still possible to have a happy life even with this disease and started doing stuff that doesn’t bother me. For example started to meet people only outside as my body was feeling more relaxed more easygoing, inside except for tinnitus people’s voices were loud and i was thinking somehow sounds attack me from everywhere like they bounce on walls and come to me, so i started spend time with people mainly outside, i met some very good friends, i did some parties and night clubs with normal paper in my ears just to experience it, I felt my body kind of tolerate it but it wasn’t so comfortable. \\n\\nThen i did many other Erasmus projects, volunteering, basically i started doing a lot with my hands - gardening, cleaning, crafting.

I was like these for 2 days speaking with some doctors saying how urgent sth has to be done, at the same nobody really helped me, also i was underage, soo difficult,\\nAnd the third day i came back from hospital and something happened- I started hearing some strange sound from television- high pitched ones that really bothered me, from this moment on i started thinking that i really fucked it up.\\nI blamed myself and lived a miserable life for some months, then tried to go to different doctors, and then I thought fuck just go on.\\nI mean i had tinnitus all the time but hyperacusis was much worse, what I struggled the most was that in some situation for example me talking face to face with a girl and suddenly my body my brain got blocked because there are some disturbing sounds around and brain goes into defensive mode, sending a lot of blood to legs hands and brain and me staying like a robot not able to say a word in front of this girl, I suffered so much because I couldn’t even express what i feel, I couldn’t express my personality, i felt whatever i say it wasn’t deep it was some reactive words just like a machine, it always used to happen when i go to deeper state of mind and reach my authenticity I become more sensitive and this shitty tinnitus always there, ookay I don’t care stay there, but when sounds around bother then I really can’t stop my body from going to defensive mode, so difficult it is.\\nMy only dream is to be able to express myself and to be my authentic version my real me\\n\\nSo i started intruding myself back to normal life, actually Erasmus projects really helped as first time my life i found people who understand me except for one of the doctors that also has this condition. Well basically i started thinking it still possible to have a happy life even with this disease and started doing stuff that doesn’t bother me. For example started to meet people only outside as my body was feeling more relaxed more easygoing, inside except for tinnitus people’s voices were loud and i was thinking somehow sounds attack me from everywhere like they bounce on walls and come to me, so i started spend time with people mainly outside, i met some very good friends, i did some parties and night clubs with normal paper in my ears just to experience it, I felt my body kind of tolerate it but it wasn’t so comfortable. \\n\\nThen i did many other Erasmus projects, volunteering, basically i started doing a lot with my hands - gardening, cleaning, crafting.

I still had no idea of his passing, until a couple weeks after that when my uncle took me to a park and in the car ride back home he got a call saying “sorry for your loss,” i asked him who and he replayed with “your dad.” i bursted out crying wondering what he meant, he further explained, i cried my heart out. A couple years later my mom got a boyfriend, he would hit my everyday and verbally abuse me, but since i was only 8 i didn’t know that it was wrong, so i never told my mom. fast forward to last year my best friend attempted suicide, thankfully she’s still here, but that wasn’t all that was going on, my friend got sexually assaulted, and i had the cops talk to me about what i know from what she’s told me, this cuased them to come to my house at absurd times for example they have to my house at 3 am, and asked me about my friend who went through that, and unfortunately that was the same night my best friend attempted suicide. this caused me to go into a depressive episode. i eventually got a therapist but it didn’t work, so soon after i got a psychiatrist who prescribed medication, none of it worked, ever. about a month after that, i was sexually assaulted. that was so very traumatic for me, and it made everything 10x worse, all my grades dropped, i stopped responding to people, i started being very easily annoyed/angry. i started becoming very aggressive ( never towards anyone). except i found myself yelling a lot more. i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. i started self-harming a lot. november i attempted suicide twice, i told my psychiatrist, and i had to be hospitalized, i was put on a 51/50. after the hospitalization i was put in a program it was a partial hospitalization program. none of that worked if anything it made it worse. i was out of school for about a month, when i went back to school they demanded me to do all the wired i was supposed to do at my time in the hospital, i felt horrible i felt like they cared more about my education rather than my well being. i can do the work later but tell me. tell me how i’m supposed to do it if i’m dead. after that i got a 504 plan, but the staff seems to be annoyed at it. all this has made me feel like i’m being strangled, i’m screaming and yelling to be helped, for someone to understand but all they do is say they do understand and then prioritize my education over my life. this has made it obvious that to me at least no one in my life cares about me as a person. this has made me still feel to better than my worse, still suffering from self harm and suicidal thoughts with what feels like no support. sorry for the rant.', 'Me and my ex broke up in 2014. Due to CPTSD/attachment trauma, I’ve been holding out hope about someday being with her again. I just found out over the weekend she got married. \\n\\nI don’t know if I can post other Reddit links here but look at my profile and you can see I posted on the heartbreak sub the background of it.\\n\\nI was abandoned and abused growing up, and my ex was the first person I ever had in my life who loved me and cared about me. As I learned later in therapy, she was the first “secure attachment” I ever had in my life. She represented so much to me. Even with all the time passed, I’ve always hoped against hope there would be something I could at some point, some way to make myself better, so I could be with her again.\\n\\nNow she’s married. Which is the exact thing I’ve been worried about for the last 7-8 years since I last had contact with her.\\n\\nWhen I’ve talked to my friends for support, they’ve all told me to some degree “well marriages don’t necessarily last forever….”; when I talked to my therapist about it and how I felt like I couldn’t move on without the hope for her, she told me to look at it as “you can’t predict the future; people change, circumstances change, relationships end etc.” I cried and said I don’t want anything bad to happen to her or for her to have to get divorced to get my chance again, and she said “just don’t focus on that part. Just remember, you can’t predict the future. You can’t say for sure what will happen. Just allow for all possibilities.”\\n\\nIs this where I’m at now? Do I have to hope for the person I’ve loved most in my life, who represents the very concept of being loved and cared about, to have a separation in her new marriage? Is that really a thing I can actually hang onto a scrap of hope on? It feels like I have to, because I can’t keep going otherwise without it.\\n\\nAs of right now, any time I can’t hang onto the sliver of hope in the unlikely scenario her relationship ends and I can be with her again, this idea keeps popping into my head; that I have a plan to find some fentanyl, go drive somewhere peaceful in the middle of nowhere, and just pass away and finally end all of the suffering. I’m scared.', 'Inferiority complex, drug addiction, trauma Rant Everything was fine until I was 12.  After that i struggled from being popular in elementary school having a lot of friends to having them reject me for having a congenital teeth disorder where i was missing my adult front teeth.  I had to hide in the bathroom for lunch with my retainer with false teeth that i had to take out, where i still retained some popular buddies but feared rejection from them as much.  I was used to having attention of being a cute kid with good genetics.  But now i was wondering why god cursed me with this disorder and paired me w/ sketchy dentists that only stole money from my family.  It was tough shying away from dating due to my confidence despite romantic interests.\\n\\nThis led to some self medication for my anxiety through drugs like MJ in high school, which largely helped me make friends.  Society rejects mj And jobs will discount you for it so i turned to oxycodone for It’s quick half life Later in college.  Then i turned into an addict after graduation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ni graduated college with a great degree in engineering.  Co ops turned sour due to office politics, where i worked full time with a great supportive manager that grew me professionally and emotionally.  I then continued part time throughout senior year but got coupled with this evil bitch named K.  What turned out to be healthy in the beginning and her even hitting on me led me to reject her advances out of fear the office might find out. She proceeds to fuck me over in office politics, berates my work, takes credit for my work and destroys my self esteem by accusing me of being arrogant or perceived to be arrogant by my coworkers.  I get unemployed for 1.5 years after graduation and turned. Into full fledge drug addIcition to oxys To mask the pain, shame, guilt i was feeling.\\n\\nI finally get my dream engineering job and fucking bring my self to that new state.  I realized when I’m off drugs, my mind pesters at myself in the past.  I gained confidence i lost in middle school/high school in college with co-ops, but rejection in the workforce permanently fucked my psyche up real bad.  After the unemployment and rejection from what I. Felt was adult  society (lots of failed interviews in final rounds), i thought something was just wrong with me.  I had a huge imposter syndrome there and inferiority complex and felt behind other new associates, espescially with the 1.5 year gap and told myself they only hired me because I’m a massive bullshitter/manipulator smooth talker.  I’m a bad person i told myself.  I ended up graduating to fentanyl there and somehow keeping everything afloat.  Quit fentanyl in December 2020 and got my life back on track then this fucking pandemic hit.  I quickly relapsed as i had no support group there, got in an accident and fucked up my teeth, decided to check into rehab.  went on fmla for a couple months and the shame guilt Was so bad i resigned upon my return.\\n\\ni worked out for a couple monthis to gain some confidence in myself and pursue another career in hospitals.  Maybe go to school again to become a HCP.  I realized now that i made the switch and worked in this field for 6 months this was me just running away from my past and pain again.  Me lying again.  And when my co workers ask me why the hell would i leave a job like that i too cant believe it.  I ended up relapsing over 1 year clean.  I’m back on oxy s only though.  I tried crystal meth and it was surprisingly spiritual, but my depression was so bad last month where i thought about ending it all.\\n\\ni feel the depression creeping back in, when the crystal kicked depression out, now i am having anxiety.  I feel some real shame and just feeling fake all over again.  Why do i have such poor self respect for myself and its no wonder why people dont respect me outside.  It’s why i only have one real friend.  It’s why I’m a loner.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nsometimes i think about ending it all, or regressing to some serious drug addiction to fucking hide the noise and pain of my mistakes.  I hate being a failure man… I hate feeling judged in everything i do, maybe even if its not intentional but i feel like it is… like the worlds out to get me… if i go back to engineering only to be rejected by companies raising their eyes to a person that left that world for a year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n9 months into sobriety i was fairly happy, then just things kept piling up and resentments and my mental health just went piss poor.  I stopped my exercises my habits and now i feel like I’m starting over again.  Self sabotage 1 on 1.  I seriously hate myself sometimes and my parents dont know that my overdoses were intentional last year.  its always my mental health that slips then goes into drugs.  I dont know why my mind is like this.  I dont know why i cant be strong or i dont know why my past makes me judge my self esteem so harshly.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI know i dont even have it as bad as others its just my perception of me being me is just so fucked up, sorry for ranting\\n\\njust wanted to get this off my chest guys.

I asked one thing from my parants when i was suicidal they didn't give it to me. i just wanted away from the school  material as it made me suicidal my parents insisted otherwise even tho I had an attempt over this almost broken my thub to show my pain. and genuinely could do much from the sheer stugering power of the Depression. i knew that the cause was school they didn't listen. \\n\\nthe most likely outcome was me dead. i had 2 attempts by hanging/choking the high estimated survival chance of each is 30% which puts me at 9% survival rate. irony is non of that school time ended up matering for me redoing the exams. i would be done in less than 4 months. was life worth so little that it should have been that carelessly risked?   \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ni need help processing this crap\", 'How religion took 16 years from my life (trauma story, trigger warning!) (This is a very long read) \\n\\nHello, to someone who might read this. \\n\\nIt feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. \\nI\\'m not professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don\\'t tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it\\'s not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the \"phase\" I have. \\n\\nBut I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I\\'m going to. \\nAs long as that is impossible I\\'m trying to figure out what is going on with me on my own. \\n\\nI did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.\\n\\n I thought my issues weren\\'t that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can\\'t call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. \\n\\nGenerally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it\\'s gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. \\n\\nAnd now there are two parts of me fighting. \\nThe one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I\\'m exaggerating, that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. \\n\\nIm torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. \\nI feel like no one could ever get me. \\nBecause my \"trauma\" doesn\\'t feel validated. \\nEven though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. \\n\\nIt still feels like I don\\'t deserve to be heard. \\nBecause on the surface everything was perfectly fine. \\n\\nAnd even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can\\'t. I can\\'t look at the positive aspects and live normally. \\n\\nIt affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can\\'t concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I\\'m constantly on guard and don\\'t feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I\\'m hiding fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I\\'m at my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I\\'m not worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I\\'m not obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don\\'t want them to think that what she does is real love. \\n\\nBut the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a \"myself\" even exist? Can I ever be \"it\"? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. \\n\\nI feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. \\n\\nEverything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. \\nThat\\'s why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can\\'t get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). \\n\\nI feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. \\n\\nIm doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can\\'t do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. \\n\\nThat was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. \\n\\nSo, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?\\n\\n (I\\'ll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I\\'m missing blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) \\n\\nIt all started even before I was born. \\nMy parents found each other through friends and got together. \\n\\nMy mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don\\'t exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle\\'s parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.\\nThey got together and married. \\n\\nThen their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. \\n\\nThen I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. \\nI never knew anything different. \\n\\nAnd as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the \"big\" service. \\n\\nAnd then the indoctrination started. \\n\\nI don\\'t remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? \\n\\nI just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren\\'t much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. \\nNow it\\'s easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. \\nBut at what price? \\n\\nIt\\'s scary to me that my memories are so blurry. \\nI don\\'t even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).\\n\\nI just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god\\'s eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. \\nI wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. \\nAnd I achieved that, I think. \\n\\nBut now I hate my past self for caring so much.\\n \\nSo what where we taught there? \\nGod created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil\\'s work) and even though they didn\\'t say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the \"real\" truth and that every other church doesn\\'t have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. \\n\\nWe were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god\\'s (the church\\'s) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.\\n\\n So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don\\'t have control about anything anyways. \\n\\nBut we\\'re still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a \"free will\" granted from god. \\n\\nWhile writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. \\nAnd it was a core beliefe of mine. \\n\\nWhen an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can\\'t anymore. \\nAnd then everything shatters. \\n\\nLosing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. \\n\\nSo in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you\\'re not saved (because for someone who is \"really\" saved it\\'s physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it\\'s because god did it. \\n\\nYou\\'re never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You\\'re even unable to think in the \"right, good way\". So you\\'re basically nothing and unimportant. \\n\\nBut when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you\\'re worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. \\n\\nAnother bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you\\'re nothing but with god you\\'re worthy. \\nIt makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. \\n\\nWho are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. \\n\\nThat\\'s why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying \"sh*t\" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. \\n\\nBecause of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the \"world\" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). \\n\\nWe weren\\'t allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren\\'t allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. \\n\\nSo if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you \"fall in love\" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren\\'t sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. \\n\\nWe were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner\\'s personality. \\nThey told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.\\n\\nAnother contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think \"wow I really value my partner as a person\". \\nNo, they\\'re s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). \\n\\nNo one is appreciating anything. \\nAnd if they are, they\\'re VERY lucky. \\n\\nBecause there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. \\n\\nGirls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. \\nAnd if you\\'re all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn\\'t want you, wouldn\\'t he? \\n\\nWe were told we were pure glasses of water. \\nAnd if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. \\n\\nBut the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That\\'s why there should be only one guy from the start. \\n\\nSo that you don\\'t end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. \\nNow I know it\\'s bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. \\n\\nWe were told to cover up so guys don\\'t sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren\\'t tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. \\n\\nAnd if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you\\'d get in trouble for it.\\n\\nI was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I\\'m glad mine wasn\\'t as controlling as others and didn\\'t force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. \\n\\nI was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that\\'s the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn\\'t really enjoy). \\n\\nSo there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. \\n\\nWith 12 you move from being with children to the \"big\" service and you\\'re finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. \\n\\nBut then you\\'re also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. \\n\\nWhen I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to \"work\".)\\n\\nBecause in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I\\'d be called that it would curse me. \\n\\nI did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be \"myself\", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn\\'t do that, because no one can ). \\n\\nI thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was \"myself\" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. \\n\\nAnd I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn\\'t notice at the time. \\n\\nPeople abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you\\'re not inviting people. \\n\\nI\\'m so glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. \\nWhich I was for being in that \"church\". \\nAnd they told me early on: it\\'s a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. \\nBut we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. \\n\\nSchool was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. \\nAnd even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn\\'t feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren\\'t allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why my definition of \"home\" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. \\n\\nSo what was living in my \"home\" like? \\n\\nI\\'m the first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I\\'m told is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.\\n\\nWhen I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. \\n\\nSo I just learned to not show my emotions at all at \"home\". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. \\n\\nMy father was in control of everything and to this day he\\'s still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. \\nAnd he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. \\n\\nHe is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. \\n\\nMy parents (more my father) still don\\'t want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can\\'t ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. \\n\\nAs I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn\\'t have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that\\'s what god made us for. \\n\\nPopping out babies, cleaning und cooking. \\n\\nBut I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. \\n\\nAnd then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? \\n\\nIn church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. \\n\\nBecause your husband is by god\\'s law above you and there to \"lead\" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can\\'t decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don\\'t have control anyways. \\n\\nThat\\'s why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what\\'s going on.\\n\\nI idolized my father until the realization that we don\\'t have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. \\n\\nI had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn\\'t find anything. \\n\\nHe wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. \\nIn front of him I am what he wants me to be. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I\\'m honestly sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. \\n\\nI could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. \\n\\nWhenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I\\'m highly dependent. \\n\\nAnother thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife\\'s home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). \\n\\nWhen I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. \\n\\nAnd in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.\\n\\nI know that I was sad but I somehow can\\'t really recall my immediate emotions from that day. \\n\\nAnd I thought I\\'m glad that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn\\'t able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn\\'t cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn\\'t think about it for years. \\n\\nBut when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. \\n\\nIt was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn\\'t I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn\\'t process properly. \\n\\nThen three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. \\n\\nWhen I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). \\n\\nBack to the cult. \\nSo am I still there? No. \\n\\nMy parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September 2018 we drove away and never came back. \\n\\nAnd many others left too. \\nWe still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don\\'t want to confront my parents.\\n \\nI really don\\'t want to be there because every time we\\'re there I\\'m not really there. I\\'m just a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I\\'m always completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can\\'t control it. \\n\\nAnd sometimes I\\'m just sad for no reason, I still can\\'t sleep and still get a massive headache and can\\'t stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn\\'t and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can\\'t stop. \\n\\nAnd it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn\\'t understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am really grateful for. \\n\\nAnd something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. \\n\\nNow I can control if I\\'m going to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.\\n\\nWhen my father is mad at me because I didn\\'t do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it\\'s disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn\\'t stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It\\'s the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. \\n\\nThere are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am and then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I\\'m the best daughter someone could have and that he\\'s so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. \\n\\nBut on the inside I think: \"if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don\\'t of, you wouldn\\'t talk to me anymore\". \\n\\nHe is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. \\n\\nAnd also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: \"I\\'m sorry but it\\'s too late.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. \\n\\nThe first 16 years of my life partly wasted. \\nI feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. \\nAnd I know it\\'s technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. \\n\\nAnd it makes me so mad that I was born because of the \"church\". Because they convinced my father to have children. \\nI was cursed before I even existed. \\n\\nAnd still. \\n\\nI can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. \\n\\nAll of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. \\n\\nThere is no moment in my life where I wasn\\'t afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.\\n\\nAnd it was so frightening, because when it\\'s out that you messed up you can\\'t attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that\\'s when people know. They see that you\\'re not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course \"premarital s*x!!!\" \\n\\nWhen a couple did it (and someone found out) it\\'s made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. \\n\\nAnd I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.\\n\\n I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.\\n\\n My parents and everyone in church who was \"responsible\" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a \"bad influence\" away from me. \\n\\nBut I still watched what I wasn\\'t allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. \\n\\nBasic knowledge like: it\\'s okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.\\n \\nAnd now? I just want to move out and study something so I\\'m always safe. I can\\'t wait for the day where I\\'m finally going to be financially independent and don\\'t have to rely on my father.\\n\\nWow it feels good put all of that in words. \\n\\nWhen you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. \\n\\nI just wish I could get help.\\n\\n\\nupdate: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn\\'t wait any longer (I was stubborn). \\nSo now i\\'m going to therapy. \\nThank you for everyone who commented. It made me feel less alone :)', \"I hate to live because of my fucking trauma & guilt! What is basically the point of my living despite the fact that I was bullied and then became a bully myself?\\n\\nI was raised by short-tempered yet caring parents. Their love and care for me was extremely genuine. Unfortunately, I was born in a country where corporal punishment is still a thing. Whenever I am misbehaving and do something extremely stupid, I get spanked, pinched, and shouted at. One time, my mother mildly punched me in the right shoulder for forgetting to tell the real date of my graduation photo online. In a nutshell, I was raised by really flawed but really loving parents.\\n\\nWhen my brother came in to this world, I was excited to have someone that I could be as best friend. Unfortunately, when he was diagnosed of autism and is very hyperactive, impulsive, destructive, and could not convey his thoughts properly, I was not prepared and inheriting my parents short-temper. \\n\\nWhat's worse when I was 8th, 9th, and 10th grade, all of the people I thought were my friends started physically and verbally bullying me horribly almost everyday and I kept on getting myself manipulated. I was sexually harassed and about to be stabbed by one of them. Fuck, one of them tried to burn me and they prevented me from escaping. \\n\\nI told my parents about me being bullied but it 50% helpful, 50% unhelpful. I was hiding my pain, wanting to vent my rage on someone, and that someone was my brother. I was horribly physically and verbally abusive towards him to the point I nearly killed him by smothering him with a pillow. I realized what the fuck I had just become. I keep on apologizing to him but keep fucking up though it was not as horrible as the past years. I wanted to keep this secret along with me in the grave. I really loved my brother, but my actions are showing otherwise. I desired to move out once I enter college because it was far away from my home. Unfortunately because of this fucking pandemic, I am stuck with my brother. I don't want to hurt him anymore and be actual bros. \\n\\nI wanted to keep this secret along with me in the grave.

I decided today to put in on this subreddit just to share. That was my first time writing anything in my diary after three years. I wrote it stubbornly, I just pour out words that are in my mind at the time so sorry for bad english or inefficient and poor paragraph sturcture. Never a good writer to begin with.', 'Feeling suicidal due to childhood trauma please read! need help feel like im gonna do it  First off, If you are taking out the time to read this, thank you! truly! Background: Growing up I grew up isolated from the world, no friends, isolated from most family members, never had a childhood or did typical kid things, I was bullied in school because I had lack of necessities clothing wise and hygiene. and I was homeschooled majority of my school years. The worse of my abuse started around when I was 14 years old. my family, were practically bullies, they often laughed at me, mocked me, recorded me while crying, when i would cry about something or be upset about something, my dad would mock me, get in my face while making agitating faces, screaming yes! yes! or I love it! (something like this) growing up they did things like slap me, spit in my face, one time my mom made me eat food she spit up as punishment because she said I was \"Disrespectful\" , one time while whooping me, my mom turned on R&B music as if they were getting a kick out of it while laughing at me, **(I think I had no clothes but I\\'m not sure don\\'t quote me on it**) made me stand in corner at night while holding a squat, one time my dad cut patches in my hair for getting on game site, ripped up raps I wrote because they were too \"Depressing\". Went through my phones and yelled at me called me weird for sending certain texts, I was often responsible for most if not all the cleaning and went to laundry mat to wash and dry clothes. my dad often made threats if the place wasn\\'t clean by time they get back like \"you will see the wrath\" or \"blood will splatter everywhere\" (this when he\\'ll use that annoying tone), they did things like drop food on floor make me pick it up, one time when I was 7 or 8 they made me eat food in the restroom next to my sibling diaper. while thinking it was funny. my uncles family came over when I was 14, realizing that something was wrong and after I told them about my suicidal thoughts, they contacted the school counselor, which led to cps, (of course cps didn\\'t help) but, since this event happened their behavior has gotten better, but there we\\'re still those days, and the controlling, manipulative behavior was still a problem. I\\'m 20 and feel behind in life because they never taught or let me do anything. another thing that made me feel confused about my parents behavior they had hot and cold moments where there were good moments, than the bad and really bad ones. and it made me feel like maybe the abuse was in my head. **I Ranaway a few weeks ago with my uncles family, now here\\'s the killer part, I always answered my mom calls and my grandma (because my grandma were on their side) they seemed so understanding and nice, but they would fear monger about all the bad things that would happen if I stayed, and that I was being used , etc., it eventually got into my head, and I ended up coming back, which I regret so strongly to the point that I almost took my life and fell into a deep dark depression. things went smoothly at first but then the bullying started back up, said hurtful things, family repeatedly called me weak and gullible for getting vaccinated, takin my wallet, kicked me out of room cuz they fear ill give my sibling Covid even though I always wear my mask when I leave, they watch my every move like I\\'m a prisoner, and my uncles family cant really help me right now because the situation changed since I left, but they said that it\\'ll be 3 months or more till they can get me again, and things are getting rough here and its getting hard to wait that long and my anxiety is skyrocketing because it feel like I\\'m losing my best years (my early 20s) . I feel like I deserve to die for doing something as stupid as coming back here. I want to end it so badly but I don\\'t have the guts and it pisses me off.**', 'living with trauma, and dying with it I was violently drugged and raped as a child, by people that went on to work in law etc. People that preach \"Oh, statutory rape and grooming are terrible\" with their pro-child rape friends with \"Check out my suicide awareness art piece\" etc. but have followed me to my old university (where I had to quit studying, because of them) a university that won\\'t give me security footage or anything.   \\nI avoid sleeping on my back, if I lay on my back I have intrusive flashbacks. I haven\\'t had any other sexual experiences, the incident is fresh in my mind and body. I\\'m afraid of older men and women. I\\'m afraid of going out and I\\'ve also had extreme seizures from the drugs I was given at the time or the severe mental toll I don’t know. I\\'ve attempted to kill myself 3 times over my life. The last one, I was thrown into an ambulance by police and treated badly... they thought I was on drugs ( I wasn\\'t) without doing any tests and treated me like so with all the stigma and disrespect, didn\\'t help me at all. Enter my mother, who was being held back by my father as she screamed \"You want to die? Then die! Try harder next time!\" and I came home to my younger siblings who\\'ve been brainwashed by my mother and one of them says \" You should die\". Social workers came over because of my mum\\'s display and my mum blamed me - “stop acting like a victim” - nothing has ever been the same. It\\'s like I\\'m barely her daughter anymore. She\\'s kicked me out of the house, paranoid that I\\'m going to \"ruin her life on purpose\". They never helped me when I was younger, all my mum said in response to the rape was \"What, you\\'re selling yourself now?\" - I was so young!!! - and \"Just take the punches, be tougher\". When I was younger my parents were all \"You\\'re too young to confront it all\" as if I was shameful to them, to \"You\\'re old enough now to deal with seeking out professional help yourself, financially too\". In the face of terrifying, debilitating confrontation the only free law service that Is available and a person who raped me works there. I\\'m so afraid of calling in and they happen to be on the other side. Rape cases don\\'t even have good chances, best I\\'ll get is a restraining order not even those evil people in prison. And well, I\\'ve volunteered at safe homes and in activism against DV and have experienced and heard that people just walk straight through restraining orders. I want closure, but I only have to the end of this year to have a viable victim assist claim to help with legal and health fees, writing a crime report with so much pushback and violent confrontation is so so scary. (For child victims here, they only get little time to eligibly go forward). I have proof in messages and there is a witness (One of their friends though) but I\\'m so afraid I\\'ll fail and the abuse will start again. The stalking, the threats, the me going out for my little sisters birthday and them being at the same restaurant and waiting to catch me alone. I fucking ran so hard, I\\'ve been running all my life and it\\'s all I can do. Disgusting that there are so much injustice and the people that commit and they can live so well, clear of mind and guilt when I am suffering and feeling like I am already dying every day. I\\'ve been thinking more and more that the pain I live with every day is more than enough to point towards suicide. Suicide where it\\'s my right, my last compassionate, able and merciful right to my abused body. I need to be put down, I\\'m already a dying fucking dog. The only thing keeping me here is the intense fear of repeating the same life, and that I haven\\'t felt sex that is loving - I don\\'t know of love. I don\\'t feel any ownership or safety within my body, but dying might be my last chance. a part of me needs hope, I need someone to compassionately see me for me and all I could\\'ve been if I wasn\\'t so wounded.', \"I repressed all my past traumas and it’s all coming up. I’m struggling. I don't know what to say honestly. I'm a 21-year old that's been through a lot. My usual tactic was to push it under a rug and move on. However, it's starting to catch up to me. Throughout the past few years, I've been struggling with body image, eating disorders, depression, self-harm, and 80% of my relationships ended in doom. Only recently have I started to realize how messed up my life and experiences have been. I've never opened up about any of it because of fear of judgement, but also because of the fear of acknowledging things. There have been so many traumas in my life that stemmed from blurred grey lines, which I've blamed myself for the longest time. \\n\\nThis past week things have been getting way worse mentally again. One of my close friends was r\\\\*ped, and I had to be there for him and hear everything he had to say, which really affected me and opened certain wounds. Then, two days ago the guy I'm seeing decided to open up and tell me about his traumatic experience as well, which made me stressed and frozen. I didn't say anything back. In addition, my body has gone to shit again. I'm also nearing the end of my degree, and my plans for the future were shattered in front of my eyes this week, which is also making me feel awful.\\n\\nThere's just a lot happening.

According to my mother the umbilical cord wrapped itself around my neck 5-6 times and it was a struggle to take it off. It nearly choked me to death though sadly enough the doctors cut it off my neck just in time. I was born a female to my mother and biological father who probably didn\\'t want me to start with, but we\\'ll get to him later in the post. Growing up, my mother worked in education as a daycare worker and eventually grew up to be the head of reading coaches in her district. When I wasn\\'t even three years old, she noticed as I was playing in the playground with the other children that I was limping extremely badly and wondered if something was up so she sent me to the hospital for an x-ray of my bones. Apparently a small hole had begun forming in my left hip and was the very beginning of hystosytosis, so she had to take a week off of work and I had to undergo surgery ASAP. Sadly even then I didn\\'t die from the anesthesia they gave me when I went under the knife, survived, and began walking about three days later after the surgery. People called it a miracle. I really wish I had died then because the doctor said that was definitely  a risk and had I survived I would need serious physical therapy for months, if not longer. So there\\'s that.\\n\\nAs I got older, it became apparent that I was struggling with some sort of neurodivergency that was initially first believed to be some form of ADHD due to me being unable to sit still in class and focus on what the teacher was saying. I was smart as a whip and I still am (I guess? Mom doesn\\'t really think the same of me in that regard anymore), but when kt came to interacting with other kids, I struggled with nonverbal communication and facial expressions, as well as socialization with my peers and being quote on quote, \"\"normal\"\" like them. \\n\\nThis was when I began bouncing from school to school to find a good fit since teachers and students alike were beginning to treat me like shit because of my differences. I was put in timeout and in hallways for being unable to listen and focus, as well as being accused of things I never did and teachers siding with the bullies instead of me because some of the teachers didn\\'t really like me or my mom because of how frequently she had to come up to my schools to defend me and clear up the bullying I dealt with almost all the time. I went to speech therapy at my second elementary school and was assisted by a rather racist white school therapist who accused me of being the victim because I got bullied all the time and didn\\'t stand up for myself, even though a student tried to stab me the week before. She diagnosed me with Asperger\\'s in 4th grade, but this was never officially diagnosed by a neuroscientist or anyone who works with behaviour. This did, however, give schools access to my IEP to take me out during classes to help me with my mental, social, and emotional issues. After my last year at this school, I moved to being homeschooled for a year by my mother and great grandmother, which actually went well for the most part. Learned more then than when I was in public school.\\n\\nAnd then I got accepted into a private school (that is now closed thank god) for the rest of my junior high years. The school was quite small, maybe 30 people in every grade maximum. But even then, I was bullied, isolated, and ignored for my hyperfixations and being different. It began calming down around 8th grade, but it still didn\\'t change the hurt. Just before I hit the 7th grade, I had came out to my mom as bisexual (long before I came out to her as a nonbinary trans man) and she immediately asked if I had gotten violated or if someone talked me into being bisexual. Confused, I said no. She then asked if I was sexually attracted to her or my sister and accused me of incest. Disgusted at this point, I said no. She immediately blamed me talking to my online friends during the time for influencing me to become bisexual and banned me from talking to them for years, though I consistently sneaked on when she wasn\\'t looking. For background, she was raised a fundamentalist Baptist under my great grandfathers church and was raised to believe the homophobic, transphobic bullshit that the Bible spews. She was disgusted that I liked girls to say the least. This was when the verbal, emotional, and mental abuse began. \\n\\nWhen I graduated 8th grade, I began going to a center where I met other teens my age. This was when I met my very first boyfriend, we\\'ll call him L. He was immediately smitten with me the moment he saw I was playing Pokemon (still a huge fan of it to this day) and wanted to date me and get to know me more. He had and still does have great qualities about him, but during the time he suffered greatly with DID, ADHD, bipolar disorder and autism, as well as anxiety and depression. And while I was not officially diagnosed with anything other than autism yet, I was dealing with gender dysphoria, depression, anxiett, and bad bad insonmia. His DID often came about in the form of alters, one alter in particular named Damien who often threatened suicide and verbally abused me. Keep in mind I wasn\\'t even 15 yet when I began dating him. This also resulted in him becoming a giant bully, often cutting me off for months at a time until he felt like talking to me again and resulting in us getting into giant arguments. Due to my forgiving nature and believing people could changed, I forgave him multiple times. Over and over and over and over and over again. This also began to break my psyche.\\n\\nWhen I was 14, I got into apprenticeships with other teenagers, my first program being a creative writing program. This was when I met the first trans person I ever knew who\\'s name was Harmony. He was a white trans guy and he spoke vocally about his queerness and it always intrigued me. How could someone be so proud of something that is a choice and that God considered sin? (At this point I was pushed back into the closet by my homophobic and eventually transphobic mother. I was in denial). I began talking to him about it and luckily he was very open to answering questions. I asked him why did he identify as trans and why was he proud of it? How he discovered he was a man? After about an hour of us talking, I left with a lot of new knowledge and realizations about myself. I was never ecstatic about puberty. As a matter of fact it was absolutely horrifying to me, especially female puberty. I was an early bloomer so it made me hate it more when people mistook me for being much older than what I was and began sexualizing my body at a young age. Even if that wasn\\'t happening, I did not like my chest and I DEFINITELY did not like having a period. I always wanted to be more like the men in physicality and in confident but I couldn\\'t be. Why did I feel this way?\\n\\nThat\\'s when it hit me. I\\'m fucking trans.\\n\\nAnd I had to keep it from my family as long as possible.\\n\\nFastforward to when I was 15, I left the first high school I was at due to travel issues and attended an online school where I would eventually finish with a high GPA and honours. I attended a space for teens in a library and often went to their homeschool group and it was actually quite fun. I got to know so many different kinds of people there from all different races, nationalities, cultures, sexualities, genders and faith. It was so exciting to meet new people, new people that actually wanted to know me for me. This space was also a strong safe space for LGBTQIA+ people, and this was the time I began discovering different gender identites and sexualities. I began experimenting with multiple nonbinary identities and began identifying as pansexual before it was eventually tainted by family. This time around we were going on a field trip to a Zine Fest on the lower west side of the city, the type of fest that is predominantly filled with queer people. I loved it there. I bought a lot of merchandise that day, including a pansexual sticker that I had put on top pf my green flannel shirt. I went home with the sticker still on my shirt, completely forgetting to remove it before I got home. My parents eventually googled the colours of the sticker when I didn\\'t tell them what it meant and my mother immediately began calling me a degenerate, saying I have no standards and would fuck animals and kids cuz I have no preference. Which incited an argument and having to explain to her I was also trans. She called me one of Satan\\'s minions, brainwashed by media, and that I\\'ll be an ugly tranny of a man. I was crushed. and my grandmother joined in on the throwing of slurs as well because their religion dictates I am going to hell for being who I am. They told me God doesn\\'t want this in his plan and I need to abide by the Bible. I snapped off, saying I didn\\'t believe in God and that God is a cruel God. They threatened to kick me out once I was 16 because it was legal in the state I live in and still currently live in, and that if I don\\'t believe in God I\\'ll be thrown into the streets. I was so scared and hurt by the abuse being thrown my way for coming out. I had my social media and technology taken away from me and couldn\\'t get back on it for another year all because of this and she nearly took away my opportunity with a programming apprenticeship. My biological dad around this time, who had suddenly come back into my life, knocked up a bitch he barely knew and had the baby, preferring his new son to the son he already had that was trying his best to be a good member to society. He hasn\\'t talked much to me since.\\n\\nSo for the sake of my safety, I became hyperfem and shoved myself back into the closet. I pretended to believe in God again and accept Christ into my heart just so they wouldn\\'t hate me and kick me out. I am 16 at this point. I date men here and there as a cis appearing woman, but whenever I tell them I\\'m trans, they get disgusted and run away. Later that year, I graduate high school early and get sent off to a junior college to complete my gen eds and get a degree. I meet a man named Kenneth who approaches me in a bad boy esque way and a week later asks for me to marry him in the hallway of my college. My parents grow to like him and we end up traveling all around the city together. I was scared to tell him I wad trans until about three months later as he identified as a cishet man. It brings about major problems thay devolve into arguments and transphobia that I won\\'t get into, as well as issues sexualizing my chest. We decide to take a break and this is when I meet my boyfriend now turned friend, Speedy. We hang out a lot and like each other a lot, but eventually that didn\\'t work out as a romantic relationship either because of me being trans since he\\'s not into men. \\n\\nAt this point during my college career I am struggling in my classes because of managing a job and dealing with abuse at home, so I begin to fail. I eventually drop out in favor of working a full time job, but that never comes to fruition as I am unwillingly brought into a bank fraud scheme that took all the money I earned away from my account, forcing me to quit my job and close my bank account for good. I have nothing to do now and I am stuck at home with no education or job. My mother and father begins abusing me even more for losing the job, my money, and dropping out of college because of mental health reasons. I am called slurs yet again, lazy, unmotivated, fat, retarded (nice thing to say to an autistic kid, right) and a plethora of other insults and slurs. As well as shaming me for not having a job. I begin turning to self harm again and substances to cope with the dailt abuse and beratement. I still do to this day.\\n\\nCome 2019, I discover a workforce program that honestly changes my life for the better that helps me gain the job skills needed to keep a job in the field of Information Technology. Even then, my parents stalk me, abuse me, and call me slurs recklessly for attending the LGBT club there and calling me demonic and evil for being a Luciferian witch during the time due to invading my privacy and actually calling up to one of the social workers I worked with during the time outting me as a witch. (According to my parents anyway. They\\'ve always been liars). Summer comes and I am promoted to an internship as a field technician at an esteemed university. But due to what happened for months before I got the internship plus the crippling dysphoria and suicidal ideation I was dealing with, I break down during my shift and attempt to slit my neck later that night. I eventually report this to my program and I am immediately hospitalized for five days. After coming out of the hospital, I am thrown into group therapy. Just to tell you, the doctors never acknowledged gender dysphoria as the cause for my issues, call it a cosmetic issue, and instead diagnose me with depression and psychosis, which doesn\\'t help. My father then gets angry at me for my attempt, calling me evil, demonic, selfish, and self centered, among telling me that my transition is evil and doesn\\'t matter and is selfish because of THEIR feelings and beliefs about it. So I ended up crying for the rest of the day about that.\\n\\nFast forward to the end of the year, I get accepted back into the program and begin interning somewhere else before the pandemic began. During 2020, I am forced to work from home remotely until June of 2020... during May of 2020, I had left my house to stay over my friends houses to escape their abuse and medically transition. During this time, I almost do start my transition but then they begin harassing me over the phone and blowing up my calls, commanding me I go home before police are called. I left my friends home before they actually did. I was so scared. \\n\\nI graduate my program in late July and begin job hunting with little to no luck until i come across a covid-19 contact tracing job that paid well, but due to shitty management and training, I lose the job in a matter of two months and get vehemently blamed for it due to mistakes I didn\\'t know about and poor training that was not my fault. A month after losing my job, my grandpa dies of covid and my mom steals my money to pay his funeral expenses WITHOUT MY FUCKING PERMISSION. Back in April, my aunt died of covid so this was just another big blow. I have been two months without a job now or any sanity. My parents refuse to allow me to transition under their house and they don\\'t care if I kill myself anymore or go into a shelter. Honestly I want to kill myself. For years I wanted hormones and surgery and all they did was abuse, silence, gaslight, and threaten me. Now their excuse is that I\\'m an adult. If I\\'m an adult then why can\\'t I make an informed choice on my body? Why can\\'t I at least attempt to be happy? I have been sniffing and consuming cleaning products to cope and have been crying myself to sleep every day and night for three months now. i want this pain to end. I already overdosed recently on bleach before and I might do it again. If I can\\'t transition, I\\'ll kill myself. I refuse to live as a woman any longer or with this pain of knowing I\\'ll never be anyone\\'s son, boyfriend, or nephew. I rather die than wait it out anymore. I should\\'ve died at birth. I should\\'ve died in surgery. I should\\'ve died when I was 12.\\n\\nTl;Dr My life is shitty and being trans, neurodivergent and mentally ill doesn\\'t help.', \"Recent Trauma I really don't know where to start with this..\\n\\nI'm eighteen.\\n\\nI graduated from high school last year, and am currently taking a gap year. I leave for Africa in less than a month. Then it's off to college (CU Boulder). I currently work at a bookstore.\\n\\nI have been struggling with depression for a lot of years, but i could never muster up the courage to talk to anyone until recently, after my girlfriend, who also happens to be one of my best friends, broke up with me. (more on this later)\\n\\nI have seen multiple therapists in the past (by choice), and only one of them was able to actually understand my nature. But my parents, who want to do everything in their power to help me, refuse to let me see him on the grounds that they feel that whenever I would leave sessions with him I would act audaciously (I saw him originally because I can't talk to my parents for the life of me).\\n\\nSince me and my girlfriend broke up (let's call her Jenn), I have slipped deeper into depression than I have ever been. The only thing that i have had to eat in the last three days has been a couple of donuts, which I promptly threw back up at around 5:30 this morning. I can't sleep for more than four hours without crying. I'm in so much pain. I have cut myself before, and have been contemplating suicide for years. I just want help. \\n\\nThere were times when i wasn't nice to Jenn. We fought, like a normal couple. We both had our moments. She was the only person I ever spoke to about my feelings. She was always so nice. and made me so happy, and I just tried to push her away. The two weeks before we broke up, I hardly spoke with her. I hated myself for doing it. I don't know why I did. But there was a force in my mind that prevented me. At the end of the two weeks, she went to visit her sisters at school (they attend the same university). I was so upset. I wanted to talk to her again, but I couldn't. So, being the ass hole that I am, I was mean to her. I went to bed that night so sad and angry at myself. I felt like the worst person in the world, and I didn't know how to fix it. \\nThe next day, she drove home, so i figured we could go and work everything out, like we always do. I went to her house, and we both apologized and hugged and made up (or so I thought). She (who has also been struggling with depression for years) then kept talking about the times that I was mean. She started to cry and told me that she needed time. I told her that was completely fine, and that I will be gone for five months come November. And that I loved her. Then she told me that she wanted to break up. She said she couldn't handle the fact that she was my only emotional outlet, and that she would fall apart when I left (which i found odd, because I mean, breaking up?) But that she still loved me and cared about me with every ounce of passion that she used to. I was (and still am) so overwhelmed with sadness. And confusion. And more pain than I have ever experienced.\\n\\nI know that I'm only eighteen. And this is bullshit high school romance. But the only thing I really want is someone to come home to. Someone that I really care about. And that I really love. It's killing me inside. I have even considered canceling the trip based on the fact that there's no way I could possibly be safe in this frame of mind. And because I don't want to lose her. \\n\\nI'm so sad, and scared, and overwhelmed, and I feel dead inside. And so does she.

I don\\'t know if this is the correct subreddit to post something like this, but its the closest one I\\'ve found. \\n\\nSo I was perusing Weibo (which is like Chinese Twitter), and I found a post by a master\\'s student (who was supposed to be graduating this year) whose account only had this one post, which was his suicide letter. \\n\\nThis post really struck a cord with me because I\\'m in a pretty similar situation (also last year of my master\\'s program), so I\\'m going to attempt to do his post justice by translating it and posting it here (My Chinese is a little bit rusty so go easy on me, guys...).\\n\\n**Translation (you can follow along in the attached pics if you can read Chinese)** \\n\\nHello everyone, I am a third-year master student in the chemical engineering program at Dalian University of Technology, and my masters degree supervisor is Dr. Z. My topic of research is ....\\n\\nuhh, Please don\\'t leave (don\\'t click away) I\\'m not here to present my thesis defense! (laughcry.jpg) \\n\\nI\\'m just here to say goodbye. After a little while, I am preparing to 一挂解千愁 (which translates to hanging himself to rid himself of a thousand worries. ).\\n\\nThis year really is a terrible year (hes pretty much saying 2020 is a disastrous or fucked up year), there is unrest both internationally and domestically (he used 鸡飞蛋打的 which is a saying that literally means \" the hen flew away and the eggs broke\" so it pretty much means that the world is chaotic). Thinking back to before finishing my undergraduate degree, I only decided to take the Masters program entrance test (In China, there are way too many students that want to do their masters so theres a national entrance exam every year similar to their university entrace exam or 高考）to avoid having to look for a job right after graduation. However, the tariff wars (USA vs China tariff wars) started right after I got accepted and the job market situation immediately became serious (I\\'m guessing he\\'s trying to say unstable/competitive). Now this year, we got caught up with covid-19. It\\'s almost like during these three years of my masters program, the world has had a bad stomach ache or something. \\n\\nah right, speaking of stomach aches, I don\\'t know why my stomach has recently been increasingly unable to stand cherry tomatoes. Recently, I had an upset stomach (diarrhea) and had to go to the washroom a number of times after eating some cherry tomatoes. (maybe he loved cherry tomatoes before?)\\n\\nAfterwards, I remembered that a little while after being accepted to the program a senior student (a male student in a higher grade) recommended me to go look for Dr. Z as a supervisor. The first time that i met Dr. Z, he lectured me on the entire history of the coal-chemical industry. Midway through his lecture my stomach began to hurt and my mind began to stray, however i had to keep a straight face and make it look like I was still paying attention. I think that that occasion was the most persistent I had ever been in my life. Subsequently, every time that I went to meet him, even if it was for the simplest question, he would most likely make me sit on the sofa and make me listen to him lecture me about the industrial background of our program for half a day (for a long time). From then on I absolutely dreaded going to him for any discussions on any topic.\\n\\nThese last three years have been..., uh, they passed pretty quickly. I\\'ve experienced the disastrous teaching quality of the professors that taught us our masters courses, and I can only compare the teaching quality to that of unfinished yogurt thats been thrown in the trashcan and left to rot for a whole week. (he\\'s saying that the teaching quality stinks as bad as foul, rotten yogurt). After I finished the majority of these courses, I started going to the lab to do experiments. \\n\\nOn the day of 开题答辩 (similar to a thesis defense, but at the beginning of their program to show professors what they were going to research... pretty much a research proposal en masse), after listening to my research proposal, the professors (reviewing our proposals) said \"it\\'s ok\" and asked one or two questions and it was finished. In reality, I hoped that they would give me some honest feedback and recommendations based on my thought process and goals. I never imagined that I would have the quickest research proposal in the group (I honestly think that he was disillusioned because Dalian university of technology is a good university in china and he must have been a good student all his life and probably considered himself as such). \\n\\n\"Do some more literary reviews, look at what others have done.\" is what my supervising professors would say when I went to them with any questions, and I often received this response. Thus, I found a couple of PhD theses and summarized the details and processes of their experiments. Afterwards, I rolled up my sleeves and went to work. Thus, I began my yearlong exchange with the experiment apparatus that I had then begun to use. Before every experiment, I would give a little prayer in hopes that it would for god sake continue to work normally. Can you even fathom the fact that any regular experiment apparatus in a reputable lab having a possibility of operating regularly only a third of the time? (maybe he means he can\\'t believe that a experiment apparatus that exists that only works properly a third of the time). I was \"this\" close to etching the words 佛祖保佑 (buddhas blessings or may buddha bless this machine) onto the experiment apparatus. Thank the heavens and the earth, that in January, I was finally able to persuade Dr. H (in our research group) to finally fix the experiment apparatus. \\n\\nAround Jan 18th, I was still in the lab doing experiments. Honestly, at the time, I seriously thought about applying for vacation leave (this would be right around Chinese New Years which is pretty much the same as skipping Christmas and doing experiments) and going home. Progress wasn\\'t good, but I saw that I was only one of the few who were left, and in the end i decided to go home. \\n\\nCOVID-19 started and I was stuck at home, family members recommended that I used my time to prepare for the civil servant exam. After half a year I came back to the school (Dalian University of Technology), and during my return quarantine we started to do online research group meetings. The professors in my research group took one look at my experiment results, and serenely commented that my data was useless and meaningless. \\n\\nah? what? But, I based my work on the processes in the PhD theses? Weren\\'t you the ones who recommended that that was what I should do?\\n\\nAlright, I was the one who was wrong, I\\'m too stupid, I don\\'t know how to think independently. \\n\\nFine, I threw all the work that I did last year out of the window and started afresh. \\n\\nDuring the summer, I desperately conducted my experiments, but now i had to share my experiment apparatus with others. In order to increase my efficiency, I let the others use the apparatus during the day and I pulled a number of all nighters to finish my experiments in hopes that I could quickly finish and focus on the National Civil Servant test. \\n\\nThen? Then I ceaselessly and incessantly did useless work. I didn\\'t know what I was doing. The exact same conditions for each experiment and each of the results were different. I lied in front of my computer looking at my data, I felt my mental sanity leaving me piece by piece. \\n\\nI looked at my apparatus, then I looked at my own hands. I didn\\'t know which one had problems. Or maybe it was my brain/head that could also be a possibility. \\n\\n\"It\\'s wrong (the data)! It\\'s your own fault!\"(the professor)\\n\\n\"me... What did I do wrong?\" \\n\\n\"You should play less games. Would the results be like this if you wasted less of your time on tiktok?\"\\n\\n\"But... But, I really gave it my all???\"\\n\\n\"Then you are stupid, lazy, and useless. For these 20 years your parents gave you so much care and affection, and in the end they raised a piece of garbage\"\\n\\n\"Then... what should i do?\"\\n\\n\"If you keep going at this rate your graduation will be delayed for sure, really disgraceful (maybe the teacher is talking about himself because having a student that gets delayed reflects badly on him as a supervisor), there are millions of masters students \\\\[in China\\\\], we don\\'t need a piece of garbage like you, go die.\"\\n\\n\"then... ok.\"\\n\\nI\\'m really a boring person, these kinds of little skits, I don\\'t know how many of them I\\'ve played through in my mind. \\n\\nWhen I think back to the research group meeting that happened a couple of days ago, Dr. Z said we should think of patents as soon as possible (its considered an easy way to graduate in China, just make some improvements on existing patents) or the school won\\'t let you graduate. In response, Dr. H angrily spat \"we can\\'t allow then to use patents to graduate! we must make them publish papers! Patents are too easy, if we allow them to use patents to graduate that will water down our standards too much!!\". \\n\\nRemember that all us students were listening because this was an online meeting, at the time i was tired and pulling an all nighter doing my PPT. When i heard what Dr. H said, I muted my mic and laughed bitterly out loud, I was wide awake then. \\n\\nTo be honest, I think that Dr. H‘s requirements were reasonable, our research group was honestly really laid back, before COVID we didn\\'t even have research group meetings. Other than our supervisors treating us to a meal once a year and taking the graduating masters students each year on a trip every year, they never took initiative to see how we were doing. But, I\\'m sorry, maybe its me that couldn\\'t meet your standards and requirements, if the school returned the half of the year that I lost to COVID, i might be ok. But, at this point, looking at my experiment data, all i can see is hopelessness and more hopelessness. Maybe I\\'m too stupid, maybe I\\'m too lazy, or maybe those few apparatuses that I used weren\\'t sufficient for me to use to conduct research. All in all, our research group has yet to have even one student have their graduation delayed. To not break our research group\\'s fine tradition, it would be best for me to disappear. Its good that our country is really struggling with this issue this year, I for one won\\'t put additional stress on our country. I think that the kind of person I am won\\'t meet the requirements of being a civil servant either and service the people of our nation. \\n\\nIf there are any usable portions of my body left, please take them away.

(And much more) They heard about the placebo effect, took it the wrong way, claimed they thought of the placebo effect, and are now trying to convince me that you can do anything if you just believed. As someone with depression this is very rude to me. \\n\\nThe first quote we will be looking at is, “Our reality is what we expect!!! if you were told you had cancer and you will die in two weeks you will!!! But ONLY if you believe you will.” As we can see this two hour long conversation has led to them claiming that you can cure your own cancer by simply believing you will survive and that if you believe your cancer will kill you (because a professional told you that will be expected due to your conditions) you will not survive. I can not in any way stop this conversation. It is pure awful. How can they say this? \\nLater on they claim that someone they knew developed breast cancer because of their heart aching from their S/O cheating on them. My friend claims this was not a coincidence. I am flabbergasted. Have I mentioned they want to become a doctor? Moving on... since i do not have it in me to explain how shitty that claim was.  \\nQuote number two, “and I also believe not everything can be proven by facts. That’s why so many people don’t agree with me about my views. But that’s okay and I respect that bc we are all different in our own way.” Did you read that like me? Not everything can be proven by facts, i feel as though that is the hardest thing to believe. I know its just me, i mean facts... they don’t think facts can prove anything..? Of course not, they are only information that has been proven to be true. Im starting to doubt my friends IQ. \\n\\nThey also believe in past lives, which i have nothing against. If you believe that good for you, I don’t see an issue. However claiming, “not everyone has spiritual knowledge within themselves, and that is 100% okay. I am above no one, but no one is above me. The evil things others have done to you must be forgiven. In our past lives, we have been that hateful person, making every judgment that you have ever made turn you into a hypocrite,” seems to cross the line. Maybe this is just me, however by spiritual they mean connection to God. I am not religious, i grew up that way but I currently am not, we have established that. My friend knows that i do not like the topic... to put it simple i do not believe in such so i am unable to relate and or continue the conversation. Every once and awhile they try to heavily convince me, which makes me uncomfortable but i brush it off. I thought about it and i came to the conclusion that saying that can be very rude to religious people. Saying at one point or that some people (possibly them) do not have that connection which they believe in; seems extremely rude. Adding on by saying once they were a horrible person. Is this a misunderstanding on my part? I also lack to understand the riddle of:  “I am above no one, but no one is above me.” I do not understand why they are speaking like this all of the sudden. Around once a month they make bazaar claims like these, their speech shifts and they always tie it to God. \\n\\nBack to the placebo effect.\\nTheir claim was, “ Idk how else to approach it so I’m just gonna tell you. I feel like mental health professionals shouldnt tell their patients that they have a mental illness. if you are told you have depression, then you will behave as such. most people need to talk to people about themselves so they can get reassurance. If you feel sick (most people get sick because they are afraid they will or they are battling mental illness), you will go to the doctor. Chontiously, you will go to get a diagnosis, but what you really want it reassurance that you will be okay. you have the power to dictate your physical, mental, and spiritual well being. if you believe taking this special pill will turn you into a god and you take the pill , you will behave as if you were a God . it’s all about believing...You are in control... AND THERE IS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS... and I know this is 100% fact because this thought came from my soul. I thought about this even before anyone told me it was a thing. the only knowledge that you can retain is your spiritual knowledge. this is 100% fact coming from the bottom of my soul... i swear.”\\n\\nInformation about the placebo effect and how their claim is so incorrect i may perish: \\nIn most cases a placebo is used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatments and is most often used in drug studies. For instance, people in one group get the tested drug, while the others receive a fake drug, or placebo, that they think is the real thing. The earliest controlled trial in psychiatry (not involving drugs) occurred in 1922, followed by the first crossover studies during the 1930s. Obviously they have not thought of this on their own. Saying i have mentioned the affect since the beginning that seems obvious. \\n\\nMy response to their claim: “Placebos are good and all for made up (or for those who believe they have something they dont) problems however... when it comes to real problems. This wouldn’t help at all. If you stick with said doctor/psychiatrist after a certain amount of time they will be able to see if it’s working or if they falsely prescribed you. Which then they will work to see the real issue. If there is none... some doctors will tell said patients. If they do not believe their goal is to make the patient believe. So, they might use said placebos. I believe they should absolutely tell a patient as soon as possible. Due to the fact that in real cases they are not most likely wanting validation. Instead help, or a way of fixing themselves.”\\n\\n Their claim was offensive to me because A, depression (the illness) does not go away on its own. B, i couldn’t imagine if a doctor didn’t tell me what issues they thought i had. It seems unreal and against my personal rights. C, claiming that all patients want VALIDATION instead of help is messed up.  \\n\\nThey insisted that was the case.\\n\\nI tried to get out of the conversation by saying, “Its very complicated. But, real mental issues and physical issues can’t be cured by telling someone they will be fine. It requires real treatment. Think how you please though.” Sadly it did not work. \\n\\nThey retaliated with, “It’s not false treatment though!!! Most people actually feel better! The placebo effect is real it has real effects on the mind which influence the body! If you truly believe that you are a cat and you behave like a cat, slowly you will morph into a cat. There is a mental illness where someone believes they are dead AND THEY BEGIN TO ACT AS IF THEY WERE DEAD!! Their skin turns dull and grey and slowly they end up dying. If I believe I will live for 130 years, I WILL !!!!.........Listen, what you believe in, turns into you reality! You just have to believe.”\\n\\nShall i mention, after I discussed the affect and how it is an existing thing, they just picked up the word like it was nothing.  \\n\\nI feel as though my response covers the rest: “Its false treatment because it isn’t actually doing anything. It is tricking them into believing it is curing their false issue. \\nThe reason most people feel better is because they tricked themselves into believing they have an issue they don’t.Mental tricks can be solved through other tricks.I hate to tell you this: you will not morph into a cat no matter how much you desire to. That isn’t possible. You are organic life.The mental illness, called Cotard's syndrome (also called walking corpse syndrome), where they think they are dead is real. A real mental illness, which cannot be cured through the placebo affect (effect?). However it can be cured through treatment. They do not slowly begin to die because they believe they will. They begin to die because the mental illness causes them to think they are already dead. Which in most cases causes the person to kill themselves, stop eating, stop drinking water, ect. They think that parts of their body are missing, or that they are dying, dead, or don't exist. They may think nothing exists. Killing themselves: Some see it as a way to prove they're already dead by showing they can't die again. \\nCotard's syndrome is rare, with about 200 known cases worldwide \\nThe symptoms are severe, Cotard's syndrome is curable with treatment. Generally, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) therapy is beneficial compared to medications in treating Cotard's syndrome.\\nIt is not listed as a specific disorder in the DSM-IV, as it is typically viewed as a part of other underlying disorders.\\nA neuropsychiatric condition, is unknown, but certain conditions are likely to cause it, including dementia, encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, subdural bleeding, epilepsy, and migraine.\\nThis article, https://www.medicinenet.com/what_is_the_cause_of_cotards_syndrome/article.htm ,  Shows more.”\\n\\nAnyways, they didn’t believe me ignored all the facts I mentioned. This conversation was just frustrating and i felt the need to type it out. I felt really uncomfortable and as if they were not listening. \\n\\n(PS at the end I mentioned how this made me uncomfortable and i was done chatting.

TLDR: There is an unbiased summary of the 1st minute of a video recording which lead to the shooting of a man in a red mask down below somewhere in the mess of text I have formulated labeled Chapter II. You have every right to an opinion, however that does not give you or anyone else the right make decisions for someone you do not know or have ever met. Also do proper research and take the time before becoming the exact problem you hypocritically hate.  I spent 8 hours of my day to scrub through an 8 minute video frame by frame watching every little detail I could describe clearly. Take an hour, read this post. I did the hard part FOR YOU. Review everything with a fresh eye, see it without the interference of media and politics. See facts and notice the difference between raw truth and the truth the media, news and people feed you. You will see the truth in this post, I hope.   \\n\\n\\nBecause of the rules of this subreddit, I cannot release names and to protect even those who even I do not agree with, here are examples of some goodies I found reworded but the same concept. Any moderator that wishes to remove this post, please feel free to message me why because I will not take silence.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Prologue:** How this began:\\n\\n>I woke up and got ready for work like any other normal quarantined morning/afternoon. I woke up, went to the restroom and opened my news up. I knew about the Kenosha shooting before I woke up but not much, just a few memes or whatever. I then started being a paranoid freak and thought that Kyle was a secret Chinese agent sent to attack specific people in a crowd because I only skimmed over the scraps of videos I found. However, as I read the comments of videos, posts, twitter feeds I was able to snag, the comments were disgusting and nasty. Some were just worshiping this Kyle fellow. As I got ready, I started digging into this and well, here we are. This is the result of my work today alone starting at 12:00pm and ending at 7:30 am.... the next day.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Before we start, here is a general idea of comments are like on Reddit and various sites I have encountered.   \\nPro-Kyle:   \\n\"Man is a dedicated hero, he deserves to have a non tear-downable statue made of gold!\"  \\n\"He is a legend in the eyes of those who live in the riots! He is a true Chad, LET HIM FREE!\"  \\n“What an absolute mad man, let him GO! AMAZING!”  \\n>  \\n>  \\nAnti-Kyle:  \\n\"White supremacist teen fires on three protesters without cause, what a villain!”  \\n\"This man was away from his home, he had no right to defend himself at all! JAIL! JAIL JAIL!\"  \\n“This dude is a murdering fuck, I hope he rots in prison knowing he murdered three good people for NO REASON!”  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Both of these thoughts and ideas are just terrible, if you think either one of these, you are a bad person with incorrect morals and ideals who jumps to conclusions for gathering all of the facts. You, are the problem. This post is not to target individuals but entire groups but not to any one side. I am not saying you can\\'t think for yourself or give your thoughts on a subject however if you don\\'t get all the facts. YOU ARE AWFUL. I won\\'t feed hypothetical garbage at you and confuse you, below you will find raw facts that I am able to provide. Do what you wish with these. Below everything is also my thoughts on the situation, opinions, notes and etc. Enjoy.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>I have also taken many writing classes in school, I hope I was able to clearly explain my point to you and others so you can educate yourself or hate me.\\n\\n**Chapter I:** Unbiased Analysis of Video Recordings of Kyle before the Shooting(All three videos I’ve found)\\n\\n>Here is my, an unbiased(as I can make it), objective and noted summary of what has been recorded and the videos I was able to find about Kyle, a 17 year old young adult,  why he was even in Kenosha in his own words. There have also been pictures of him scrubbing spray paint off of walls. These are just my summaries of his statements without making assumptions or submitting my opinion. I do not speculate where he is supposed to be there or not because there is no proof, the proof is in the videos. Watch and follow along if you wish. I did leave out details that I couldn\\'t explain and did not pertain to the issues. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* In the first video, Kyle states he is there to help, to defend a specific business and he also states that part of his job is to help other people. He goes further and explains that he is armed because he feels he is going into harms way and needs his rifle to defend himself. He shows off his medkit and his rifle in said video. The video cuts off shortly after brandishing both items, the medkit and the rifle. The rifle appears to be an AR-15.\\n* Continuing, Kyle is seen in another video stating that he was \\'protecting from the citizens\\' Kyle also informs the camera person that he was pepper sprayed by someone in the crowd. The camera person assumes that Kyle and his companions are using non-lethal, Kyle corrects him without being prompted that he does not have non-lethal ammo and that he is using lethal ammunition. Kyle then asks the camera person(s) to step back and proceeds to call the medics/EMT over to him, the video cuts off here.  Video cuts off there.\\n* A third video featuring Kyle shows the camera originally on a different armed person who will be called A in this part. The Camera person starts off by asking if it was a good angle before asking if the two armed men, if they were both local and both men A and Kyle answered yes nearly at the same time. Kyle introduces himself and soon mentions the Corona virus to the camera person who seems to be fine with being close to Kyle. The Camera man states he has a shirt that says he survived the Coronavirus. Soon a person in the background mentions ‘taking that restaurant’ then the camera person responds with ‘yeah.’  The camera pans down the street but the quality is too low to see what is going on. Kyle then says something partially incoherent about something ‘being dangerous’ and the camera person states they have been ‘doing this for about 12 years.’ Kyle is astonished and asks the camera person their age, the camera person responds with 41, Kyle is still shocked about this statement. The Camera person continues to telling both A and Kyle that if they see him get hit and knocked out, thats when he needs help, or if it looks like someone is going to beat him with a club, other than that, he doesn’t finish his statement. He says ‘non-aggression principle you know?’ And that he doesn’t want anyone hurt.   \\n\\n\\n>Based off of the three videos, his intentions and actions are stated consistently throughout all the videos found, he is there to help people, he is willing and able to defend himself and that he knows he is in harms way. In these videos, he is not seen shooting, firing or making any threats to anyone. He has not killed or harmed anyone within these videos. We are not bringing up what has happened between. The videos contains FACTS and thats the point here. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Chapter II:** Unbiased Analysis of Video Recording of Shooting(1st minute only)\\n\\n>I know that I have not covered the entire video, I do not see the point in wasting my time if no one will listen. If I get any attention to this post that is worthy, I will of course keep going. I may even do this regularly. Until then, you must enjoy this analysis of the first 60 seconds of the video(Source 5) in the description. The link was posted by a throwaway account on a post that was on the front page, thank you stranger. I again, left out any details that do not pertain to anything related to what happened except for a few minor things which may be important. I don\\'t get paid for this stuff. Remember, this is just a summary of what happens in the video without my thoughts, just a transcript but without professionalism or proper formatting.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>There are two perspectives in this video, X and Y. Please be careful when reading this part and watch the video so it makes more sense. This summary is in order of the video not of events. The video splices together all together about 4 different perspectives but in the first minute there are only 2 camera people. They will be labeled when it changes. I don\\'t have super crazy editing software or anything, I just lowered the DPI on my mouse and dragged over every frame for several hours.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>Perspective X: The video starts out with a view of the dealership lot, Kyle has not been sighted so far. The camera person explains that the man he previously spoke to said that his phone was slapped out of his hand and got socked(punched) at the same time. In the background it sounds like loud banging, steady constant beat. The Camera person continues to talk about the man getting his phone slapped. The Camera person then zooms into the distance and then back out again before panning to the dealer ship. During the pan, the view of two people running is clearly seen. The camera person explains then that the orders being shouted about ‘no cameras’ were from ‘white boys’ At 28 seconds, Kyle is seen running into the screen towards the building of the dealership, he is clearly carrying something resembling his AR-15 in his hands, no shots have been fired during this video relating to the incident. Soon after Kyle, another man who is masked is seen running the same direction as Kyle, a few seconds later the masked man is seen holding a bag(31 seconds). The Camera person states that someone is Antifa. The bag is clear in future frames but is not limp nor does it appear to containing, it may some sort of liquid or clear items inside allowing it to keep it’s bloated shaped. Backing up a few frames, the other man running behind Kyle is now lifting the bag over the back of his shoulder. The bag is now thrown from the masked man(red masked man) and hits the ground just behind Kyle. It appears to have popped or burst after being thrown. After the bag is thrown and hits the ground(33 seconds) Kyle appears to turn around and point his rifle towards the man who throw the bag at him. The masked man does notice the gun is pointing at him from how he backs up with his arms out, no gunshots have been fired from Kyle or anyone related to this incident. Kyle turns away and the masked man continues to follow Kyle before The Camera person sees the gun at this point and states it clearly. After Kyle goes behind the vehicle, the masked man continues to pursue after Kyle, a gunshot(F)(35 seconds) is fired but at this time during the video, the shooter is not clearly seen in this part of the footage.  The Camera person reacts to the shot. A man in the background shouts ‘fuck you’ which comes from the street. Kyle remakes his appearance from behind the car however the footage is very low quality and a lot is hard to make out. It is clear the masked man from before is still pursuing Kyle between two cars, 4 Gunshots(G, H, I, J)(38 seconds) are heard before both vanish from sight. Two more shots(K and L)(40 Seconds) are fired, then another shot is fired (M)(41\\\\~ Seconds) as the camera person to the side says that ‘he’ shot ‘him’ before more shots are heard again. The camera person moves towards a wall with bushes, as a man in the distance calls out ‘yo what the fuck?’  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>Perspective Y: At 44 seconds this perspective begins in the, A camera person in the lot or on the edge is filming about 10 yards away to the right from Perspective X. It starts at the part where Kyle vanishes from view behind the small group of vehicles and the first shots. The masked man is still following Kyle as Kyle has his back turned  and is not aiming. The first shot(F)(45\\\\~ Seconds) is recorded in about 1 second into perspective Y(35 seconds into the video covering X). A man wearing black with white letters is seen to the right who is holding something in his hand that is dark and thin. Running between the two vehicles ,Kyle(start of 47\\\\~ seconds) turns and raises his rifle, the pixels darken indicating he raised something, 4 gunshots(G, H, I, J)(38 Seconds in X, 47 in Y) are recorded. The masked man appears to fall to the ground, the footage partially corrupts around where the masked man fell, Kyle(start of 49) is seen moving around the vehicle. 2 gunshots(K and L)(40 seconds into X, 50 seconds into Y) are recorded, 1 gunshot(M)(41\\\\~ seconds into X, 51 seconds into Y) are recorded. Kyle makes an appearance from behind the vehicle and begins to approach the body. Around 58 seconds, Kyle has his rifle lowered and moves towards the body and appears to examine the masked man’s body. End of the first minute.  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>This is just 1 minute out of 7 minutes and 40 seconds of a video clip I found on the internet. As well as the two other sources below. Already a lot has happened. It will take me another 8 or so hours to go through the rest of the video carefully looking at every bit of detail. \\n\\n  \\n**Conclusion:** My Opinions Released and Other Things\\n\\n>This is only the first minute of the video I examined, two different perspectives which tell very similar stories. You may go through the videos as you please, scanning the video in Generic Windows or Apple video software, look at the details. It is now about 7:30am when I am typing and going over this one last time, I am exhausted. I have changed that time six times so far. Do me a favor, educate yourself before you go online and talk about something you barely understand. My post is not perfect in any way however it’s here to make the point that anyone can take the time to go over all of the information and study what is going on. Make time if you can\\'t, This is important, the life of a 17 year old is at stake. Whether he is guilty or not is not for anyone on Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, the coffee shop or even my mom can decide but you can make sure you are told the truth.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*So DirtyRanger34, what are your thoughts on what happened, what is your biased opinion now that you’ve picked through all the information?*\\n\\n>I think Kyle should’ve stayed home, watched the news and maybe did something in his hometown where he lived instead of in another state. I do find his attitude and discipline with his rifle admirable, he was calm and collected the entire time even when his life was threatened. With unexplained gunshots, I think he may have panicked after they went behind the first car in X, the first gunshot. He continued until the masked guy was on top of him before firing 4 rounds(G, H, I and J) at the red masked man. Kyle was not a mass shooter or white supremacist, terrorist. 3 people got shot after attacking him, if you think that makes you a terrorist, I guess I need to tell our veterans something they\\'re not going to like.   \\n>  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>When he looked at the body, he told someone on the phone that he killed someone, the person most likely told him to turn himself in. Which is why he started back towards where he knew police were? Do you think if he wanted to run, he would\\'ve I dunno... RAN AWAY? Some of you people are just.... wow. you act like he ran around and shot 3 random people for no reason? They attacked him.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>  \\nBad Ideals/Ethics:  \\n>  \\n>Next time anyone who says it wasn\\'t self defense because he wasn\\'t at home, can no longer defend themselves from muggers, kidnappers and attacks if they are not in their homes. You must now accept your fate and be killed, kidnapped or robbed from now on. This isn\\'t what I actually think, its what people like YOU think. Not all of you, but a lot of you.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>Bad Ideals/Ethics again:   \\nKyle was defending his neighbors from attackers, doing what is his given right to bear arms and defend against those who wish to harm this country. He shot them, it doesn\\'t matter why, they were all bad right? This isn\\'t what I actually think, its what people like YOU think. Not all of you, but a lot of you.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>I know there are people like me, who actually go through information. Good on you, but speak up. Let your voices be heard! Don\\'t let these two sides bully you, you are you. Stand for what is right.  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>  \\n>My opinions did not reflect in my summary, I tried to remain as unbiased as I can while describing exactly what happens in the video second by second/frame by frame, stating only what I can prove using the video and the facts. I only explain what is going on, not what I think is going on. My summary has affected my opinion however and I firmly believe without a doubt that Kyle defended himself against several attackers who wanted to harm him and take his rifle. Kyle was nearly soaked in something in a plastic bag, nearly stomped on by at least two people, nearly pinned and restrained by a group of people who wanted to hurt him and finally a guy with a gun aiming it at him after he faked surrendering. I feel this is justified self defense but, whether he should\\'ve been there in the first place? No, he should\\'ve been home studying.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>This part is a little all over, I am sorry ahead of time for this. Some people also on Reddit say that, they were surprised that his photo in a cadet uniform and are saying he would make a great cop. If he didn\\'t pull this stunt, I think he would\\'ve made a good cop. He showed, restraint, courage, determination and knew if he messed up. Isn\\'t that what you want? Cops to show restraint under duress while still being courageous enough to help people with confidence and if they mess up or do something bad, they admit it?   \\n  \\n>  \\n>That is what Kyle did, whether he was right or wrong.   \\n  \\n>  \\n>The only thing I know, is that most of you... are awful, wrong and should rethink your views now. \\n\\n*What are your thoughts on each of the three people who got shot by Kyle?*\\n\\n* Red masked Guy: Idiot, chased after a man with a gun. You got shot, good work, what did that accomplish? Idiot.\\n* Skater Guy: Probably wanted to do some honest good, it didn’t look like he tried to hit Kyle, only hold him down. It’s a shame he died. \\n* Guy who got his bicep blown off: FUCKING TRASH. You faked your surrender only to pull a gun on a man, not only are you trash but you played like trash. I personally hope he gets slapped with harsher charges. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>YOU have the opportunity to have every inch of the video combed FOR YOU. If you enjoyed this and want me to comb through the rest of the video, I will do so. Just tell me, I will spend my days of combing this for you to explain everything I can in an unbiased summary. It takes time since I work but I will do it if you\\'re willing to listen.   \\n>  \\n>That\\'s it folks, I am done with this post. Take your time and read it, I can clarify and correct anything I feel that needs to be corrected. I did not state names beyond Kyle because I don\\'t think it matters who they were before this happened, it matters what happened during the videos, maybe slightly before the videos but not far. \\n\\n**Notes and Miscellaneous:**\\n\\n* I will try to answer questions however any questions that show a sense of ignorance, hate or malice will be ignored to the best of my abilities. \\n* I am not a debater, I havedebate skills but I won\\'t argue my point, this post should do that for me. \\n* I am a 22 year old man who works an 8 and a half hour shift 5-6 days a week 365 days a year in customer service. I am not a Journalist, YouTuber or Influencer. I don\\'t even have a Facebook account, Twitter, A Youtuber blog, Instagram or OnlyFans. Not yet anyways.\\n* I have depression. This world, makes my depression flare up. Correction, people make my depression flare up.  \\n\\n\\n**A few notable mentions:** You know who you are, not talking about everyone.\\n\\n* Subreddit Mods/Owners: Allowing these relentless mobs to make these disgusting comments and partake in these discussions to play judge, jury and executioner Ones who also silence those who post differing opinions. Enforcing your will to silence others is not much different than a tyrannic government silencing you. Awful,\\n* Redditors: Jumping to conclusions and making nasty comments about a person they barely know, praising a person they barely know and not understanding a situation in full detail. You spread lies and false truths and expect everything to be done YOUR way or no way.  Awful.\\n* Twitter People: Spewing their useless thoughts making an entire situation worse most likely because they haven’t gone through the information carefully. You are cringe, truly, you think that followers matter on social media? Grow up. Awful.\\n* Journalists and News: Taking sides in a discussion they have no right to and carving the nation into what they want. Report the news, you’re not here to have an opinion your business is facts. Do not put race into anything.  Awful. \\n* Readers to this post: You already making a decision whether Kyle deserves to be arrested or imprisoned or praised. After reading this post, you should change your mind and mind your business.  Awful.\\n* Me: I spent all my free time, time off at work, my breaks and lunch at work, my sleeping time to make this post because I stuck my own nose in it I should’ve been playing Tarkov. Awful.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n\\n1. Kyle Rittenhouse explaining his purpose: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M\\\\_\\\\_CDfa8Vcg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M__CDfa8Vcg)\\n2.

Stay safe, everyone be nice. I will be back to inspect the damage when I get my less than 4 hours of sleep before work. We all die anyways.', \"My friend is trying to convince me that illnesses are curable by strongly believing that you will be healthy. (And much more) They heard about the placebo effect, took it the wrong way, claimed they thought of the placebo effect, and are now trying to convince me that you can do anything if you just believed. As someone with depression this is very rude to me. \\n\\nThe first quote we will be looking at is, “Our reality is what we expect!!! if you were told you had cancer and you will die in two weeks you will!!! But ONLY if you believe you will.” As we can see this two hour long conversation has led to them claiming that you can cure your own cancer by simply believing you will survive and that if you believe your cancer will kill you (because a professional told you that will be expected due to your conditions) you will not survive. I can not in any way stop this conversation. It is pure awful. How can they say this? \\nLater on they claim that someone they knew developed breast cancer because of their heart aching from their S/O cheating on them. My friend claims this was not a coincidence. I am flabbergasted. Have I mentioned they want to become a doctor? Moving on... since i do not have it in me to explain how shitty that claim was.  \\nQuote number two, “and I also believe not everything can be proven by facts. That’s why so many people don’t agree with me about my views. But that’s okay and I respect that bc we are all different in our own way.” Did you read that like me? Not everything can be proven by facts, i feel as though that is the hardest thing to believe. I know its just me, i mean facts... they don’t think facts can prove anything..? Of course not, they are only information that has been proven to be true. Im starting to doubt my friends IQ. \\n\\nThey also believe in past lives, which i have nothing against. If you believe that good for you, I don’t see an issue. However claiming, “not everyone has spiritual knowledge within themselves, and that is 100% okay. I am above no one, but no one is above me. The evil things others have done to you must be forgiven. In our past lives, we have been that hateful person, making every judgment that you have ever made turn you into a hypocrite,” seems to cross the line. Maybe this is just me, however by spiritual they mean connection to God. I am not religious, i grew up that way but I currently am not, we have established that. My friend knows that i do not like the topic... to put it simple i do not believe in such so i am unable to relate and or continue the conversation. Every once and awhile they try to heavily convince me, which makes me uncomfortable but i brush it off. I thought about it and i came to the conclusion that saying that can be very rude to religious people. Saying at one point or that some people (possibly them) do not have that connection which they believe in; seems extremely rude. Adding on by saying once they were a horrible person. Is this a misunderstanding on my part? I also lack to understand the riddle of:  “I am above no one, but no one is above me.” I do not understand why they are speaking like this all of the sudden. Around once a month they make bazaar claims like these, their speech shifts and they always tie it to God. \\n\\nBack to the placebo effect.\\nTheir claim was, “ Idk how else to approach it so I’m just gonna tell you. I feel like mental health professionals shouldnt tell their patients that they have a mental illness. if you are told you have depression, then you will behave as such. most people need to talk to people about themselves so they can get reassurance. If you feel sick (most people get sick because they are afraid they will or they are battling mental illness), you will go to the doctor. Chontiously, you will go to get a diagnosis, but what you really want it reassurance that you will be okay. you have the power to dictate your physical, mental, and spiritual well being. if you believe taking this special pill will turn you into a god and you take the pill , you will behave as if you were a God . it’s all about believing...You are in control... AND THERE IS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS... and I know this is 100% fact because this thought came from my soul. I thought about this even before anyone told me it was a thing. the only knowledge that you can retain is your spiritual knowledge. this is 100% fact coming from the bottom of my soul... i swear.”\\n\\nInformation about the placebo effect and how their claim is so incorrect i may perish: \\nIn most cases a placebo is used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatments and is most often used in drug studies. For instance, people in one group get the tested drug, while the others receive a fake drug, or placebo, that they think is the real thing. The earliest controlled trial in psychiatry (not involving drugs) occurred in 1922, followed by the first crossover studies during the 1930s. Obviously they have not thought of this on their own. Saying i have mentioned the affect since the beginning that seems obvious. \\n\\nMy response to their claim: “Placebos are good and all for made up (or for those who believe they have something they dont) problems however... when it comes to real problems. This wouldn’t help at all. If you stick with said doctor/psychiatrist after a certain amount of time they will be able to see if it’s working or if they falsely prescribed you. Which then they will work to see the real issue. If there is none... some doctors will tell said patients. If they do not believe their goal is to make the patient believe. So, they might use said placebos. I believe they should absolutely tell a patient as soon as possible. Due to the fact that in real cases they are not most likely wanting validation. Instead help, or a way of fixing themselves.”\\n\\n Their claim was offensive to me because A, depression (the illness) does not go away on its own. B, i couldn’t imagine if a doctor didn’t tell me what issues they thought i had. It seems unreal and against my personal rights. C, claiming that all patients want VALIDATION instead of help is messed up.  \\n\\nThey insisted that was the case.\\n\\nI tried to get out of the conversation by saying, “Its very complicated. But, real mental issues and physical issues can’t be cured by telling someone they will be fine. It requires real treatment. Think how you please though.” Sadly it did not work. \\n\\nThey retaliated with, “It’s not false treatment though!!! Most people actually feel better! The placebo effect is real it has real effects on the mind which influence the body! If you truly believe that you are a cat and you behave like a cat, slowly you will morph into a cat. There is a mental illness where someone believes they are dead AND THEY BEGIN TO ACT AS IF THEY WERE DEAD!! Their skin turns dull and grey and slowly they end up dying. If I believe I will live for 130 years, I WILL !!!!.........Listen, what you believe in, turns into you reality! You just have to believe.”\\n\\nShall i mention, after I discussed the affect and how it is an existing thing, they just picked up the word like it was nothing.  \\n\\nI feel as though my response covers the rest: “Its false treatment because it isn’t actually doing anything. It is tricking them into believing it is curing their false issue. \\nThe reason most people feel better is because they tricked themselves into believing they have an issue they don’t.Mental tricks can be solved through other tricks.I hate to tell you this: you will not morph into a cat no matter how much you desire to. That isn’t possible. You are organic life.The mental illness, called Cotard's syndrome (also called walking corpse syndrome), where they think they are dead is real. A real mental illness, which cannot be cured through the placebo affect (effect?). However it can be cured through treatment. They do not slowly begin to die because they believe they will. They begin to die because the mental illness causes them to think they are already dead. Which in most cases causes the person to kill themselves, stop eating, stop drinking water, ect. They think that parts of their body are missing, or that they are dying, dead, or don't exist. They may think nothing exists. Killing themselves: Some see it as a way to prove they're already dead by showing they can't die again. \\nCotard's syndrome is rare, with about 200 known cases worldwide \\nThe symptoms are severe, Cotard's syndrome is curable with treatment. Generally, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) therapy is beneficial compared to medications in treating Cotard's syndrome.\\nIt is not listed as a specific disorder in the DSM-IV, as it is typically viewed as a part of other underlying disorders.\\nA neuropsychiatric condition, is unknown, but certain conditions are likely to cause it, including dementia, encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, subdural bleeding, epilepsy, and migraine.\\nThis article, https://www.medicinenet.com/what_is_the_cause_of_cotards_syndrome/article.htm ,  Shows more.”\\n\\nAnyways, they didn’t believe me ignored all the facts I mentioned. This conversation was just frustrating and i felt the need to type it out. I felt really uncomfortable and as if they were not listening. \\n\\n(PS at the end I mentioned how this made me uncomfortable and i was done chatting. I got hit with the, why and what do you mean by uncomfortable.)\\n\\nHave a nice night\", 'Who to believe? So I\\'m going to start off at the very beginning. About 5 or 6 years ago, so when I was around 8 or 9, my mom had brought me to a restaurant, and explained to me that my dad wasn\\'t my biological dad. Apparently my biological father and my mother had broken up when I was around 2. Tgat was all my mom told me. Then, I would say probably in 2019 if I remember correctly, my mother explained to me why I never saw my Biological dad. She had told me that he had verbally and physically abused both of us, and would pinch me whenever he got angry with me, often because I was excessively crying... like toddlers do...\\nBut very recently, I had hit my cousin up on snapchat, and asked what my my bio dad, who I\\'m just going to call bio, looked like. My cousin sent me a picture and I asked him if he had any contact info, and after he said no I asked him if he could ask his mom for bio\\'s number. Yesterday I finally got it, mind you my parents knew absolutely nothing about this. So I texted him, just asked, \"Hi, is this \"bio?\" He said yes, and I told him who it was. He called me, and we talked, and I cried. Turns out I have a 7 year old sister who\\'s birthday is only 4 days before mine. It was very simple, he asked me how school was, what my favorite color was, and what I liked to do... you know, simple things like that. He asked me if he could pick me up for dinner on Friday (so today) and I was like, \"oh, I\\'ll ask my parents.\" \\nSo we hung up. I then texted my mom to tell her that I had contacted bio and that he wanted to take me out for dinner on Firday \\nShe told me some very frightening things about the extent of their relationship. She had told me that he had left me and my mom at Fred Myers twice, after she wouldn\\'t buy him things he wanted. And that when they lived in a apartment, the neighbors would hear the fights and called the police on him frequently, and that he was arrested frequently. And she told me that once they moved into the house we live in now, things got worse because there were no wall neighbors anymore. She told me that the night she finally left, she was putting me down to sleep, and he had walked in drunk, and ripped open her rent money and teared it up in front of her because he was mad about something. And that I had crawled into the room, and he had thrown a chair and a stick at me.\\nRight off the bat, the way she said he had thrown a \"stick\" at me seemed unnatural, like I was watching a badly acted movie scene. But she is my mother so I believed her.\\nMy cousin had asked me how it went, and I told him what my mom had said. My cousin had replied saying that \"his mom doesn\\'t want to talk bad about my mom, but she wants me to know that that is all false.\" I get a text from bio, telling me that all of the stuff my mom had told me was true (my cousin or aunt had not texted him or talked to him about what I had said yet) and I wassurprised, of course, but it also felt odd that he would immediately assume what my mom had said was true. And then, I get another text from him, my aunt had told him what my mom had told me. The text from him stated that \"what my mom said was not the truth, and that he shouldn\\'t have assumed it was.\" I was like \"well okay then, what really happened, why did he say  she told the truth at first, assumed it?\" In my head. \\nStuff went on for a while, and then something finally clicked. Why on earth would he assume and say that what she said was true. This is so hard to explain, but why would he text me saying what she had said was true, if she is telling the truth, then he was thinking that she had watered the story down a bit. If she wasn\\'t telling the truth, then he was assuming she was telling the truth, and when he finally found out what she had told me, he told me it wasn\\'t true.\\nI hope you get what I mean, but the point of this is basically wanting help, who should I trust?\\nOf course I want to believe my mom, as I dont want to believe that she would lie about something so serious. But at the same time, some things just dont add up. She had told me that he was a \"narcissistic, schizophrenic, sociopath\" and that he would seem charming. Which made me believe her a bit more, but I also know that she struggles with mental disorders herself (Bipolar) I just really need to figure this out, but no matter what, I do believe in second chances, and it\\'s not just my biological dad I want to meet, but also my sister.', nan, nan, 'Suicide Letter of a masters student from Dalian University of Technology  \\n\\nHey guys, this is the first time posting in [r/awfuleverything](/r/awfuleverything) (It\\'s my first time posting anything on reddit TBH). I don\\'t know if this is the correct subreddit to post something like this, but its the closest one I\\'ve found. \\n\\nSo I was perusing Weibo (which is like Chinese Twitter), and I found a post by a master\\'s student (who was supposed to be graduating this year) whose account only had this one post, which was his suicide letter. \\n\\nThis post really struck a cord with me because I\\'m in a pretty similar situation (also last year of my master\\'s program), so I\\'m going to attempt to do his post justice by translating it and posting it here (My Chinese is a little bit rusty so go easy on me, guys...).\\n\\n**Translation (you can follow along in the attached pics if you can read Chinese)** \\n\\nHello everyone, I am a third-year master student in the chemical engineering program at Dalian University of Technology, and my masters degree supervisor is Dr. Z. My topic of research is ....\\n\\nuhh, Please don\\'t leave (don\\'t click away) I\\'m not here to present my thesis defense! (laughcry.jpg) \\n\\nI\\'m just here to say goodbye. After a little while, I am preparing to 一挂解千愁 (which translates to hanging himself to rid himself of a thousand worries. ).\\n\\nThis year really is a terrible year (hes pretty much saying 2020 is a disastrous or fucked up year), there is unrest both internationally and domestically (he used 鸡飞蛋打的 which is a saying that literally means \" the hen flew away and the eggs broke\" so it pretty much means that the world is chaotic). Thinking back to before finishing my undergraduate degree, I only decided to take the Masters program entrance test (In China, there are way too many students that want to do their masters so theres a national entrance exam every year similar to their university entrace exam or 高考）to avoid having to look for a job right after graduation. However, the tariff wars (USA vs China tariff wars) started right after I got accepted and the job market situation immediately became serious (I\\'m guessing he\\'s trying to say unstable/competitive). Now this year, we got caught up with covid-19. It\\'s almost like during these three years of my masters program, the world has had a bad stomach ache or something. \\n\\nah right, speaking of stomach aches, I don\\'t know why my stomach has recently been increasingly unable to stand cherry tomatoes. Recently, I had an upset stomach (diarrhea) and had to go to the washroom a number of times after eating some cherry tomatoes. (maybe he loved cherry tomatoes before?)\\n\\nAfterwards, I remembered that a little while after being accepted to the program a senior student (a male student in a higher grade) recommended me to go look for Dr. Z as a supervisor. The first time that i met Dr. Z, he lectured me on the entire history of the coal-chemical industry. Midway through his lecture my stomach began to hurt and my mind began to stray, however i had to keep a straight face and make it look like I was still paying attention. I think that that occasion was the most persistent I had ever been in my life. Subsequently, every time that I went to meet him, even if it was for the simplest question, he would most likely make me sit on the sofa and make me listen to him lecture me about the industrial background of our program for half a day (for a long time). From then on I absolutely dreaded going to him for any discussions on any topic.\\n\\nThese last three years have been..., uh, they passed pretty quickly. I\\'ve experienced the disastrous teaching quality of the professors that taught us our masters courses, and I can only compare the teaching quality to that of unfinished yogurt thats been thrown in the trashcan and left to rot for a whole week. (he\\'s saying that the teaching quality stinks as bad as foul, rotten yogurt). After I finished the majority of these courses, I started going to the lab to do experiments. \\n\\nOn the day of 开题答辩 (similar to a thesis defense, but at the beginning of their program to show professors what they were going to research... pretty much a research proposal en masse), after listening to my research proposal, the professors (reviewing our proposals) said \"it\\'s ok\" and asked one or two questions and it was finished. In reality, I hoped that they would give me some honest feedback and recommendations based on my thought process and goals. I never imagined that I would have the quickest research proposal in the group (I honestly think that he was disillusioned because Dalian university of technology is a good university in china and he must have been a good student all his life and probably considered himself as such). \\n\\n\"Do some more literary reviews, look at what others have done.\" is what my supervising professors would say when I went to them with any questions, and I often received this response. Thus, I found a couple of PhD theses and summarized the details and processes of their experiments. Afterwards, I rolled up my sleeves and went to work. Thus, I began my yearlong exchange with the experiment apparatus that I had then begun to use. Before every experiment, I would give a little prayer in hopes that it would for god sake continue to work normally. Can you even fathom the fact that any regular experiment apparatus in a reputable lab having a possibility of operating regularly only a third of the time? (maybe he means he can\\'t believe that a experiment apparatus that exists that only works properly a third of the time). I was \"this\" close to etching the words 佛祖保佑 (buddhas blessings or may buddha bless this machine) onto the experiment apparatus. Thank the heavens and the earth, that in January, I was finally able to persuade Dr. H (in our research group) to finally fix the experiment apparatus. \\n\\nAround Jan 18th, I was still in the lab doing experiments. Honestly, at the time, I seriously thought about applying for vacation leave (this would be right around Chinese New Years which is pretty much the same as skipping Christmas and doing experiments) and going home. Progress wasn\\'t good, but I saw that I was only one of the few who were left, and in the end i decided to go home. \\n\\nCOVID-19 started and I was stuck at home, family members recommended that I used my time to prepare for the civil servant exam. After half a year I came back to the school (Dalian University of Technology), and during my return quarantine we started to do online research group meetings. The professors in my research group took one look at my experiment results, and serenely commented that my data was useless and meaningless. \\n\\nah? what? But, I based my work on the processes in the PhD theses? Weren\\'t you the ones who recommended that that was what I should do?\\n\\nAlright, I was the one who was wrong, I\\'m too stupid, I don\\'t know how to think independently. \\n\\nFine, I threw all the work that I did last year out of the window and started afresh. \\n\\nDuring the summer, I desperately conducted my experiments, but now i had to share my experiment apparatus with others. In order to increase my efficiency, I let the others use the apparatus during the day and I pulled a number of all nighters to finish my experiments in hopes that I could quickly finish and focus on the National Civil Servant test. \\n\\nThen? Then I ceaselessly and incessantly did useless work. I didn\\'t know what I was doing. The exact same conditions for each experiment and each of the results were different. I lied in front of my computer looking at my data, I felt my mental sanity leaving me piece by piece. \\n\\nI looked at my apparatus, then I looked at my own hands. I didn\\'t know which one had problems. Or maybe it was my brain/head that could also be a possibility. \\n\\n\"It\\'s wrong (the data)! It\\'s your own fault!\"(the professor)\\n\\n\"me... What did I do wrong?\" \\n\\n\"You should play less games. Would the results be like this if you wasted less of your time on tiktok?\"\\n\\n\"But... But, I really gave it my all???\"\\n\\n\"Then you are stupid, lazy, and useless. For these 20 years your parents gave you so much care and affection, and in the end they raised a piece of garbage\"\\n\\n\"Then... what should i do?\"\\n\\n\"If you keep going at this rate your graduation will be delayed for sure, really disgraceful (maybe the teacher is talking about himself because having a student that gets delayed reflects badly on him as a supervisor), there are millions of masters students \\\\[in China\\\\], we don\\'t need a piece of garbage like you, go die.\"\\n\\n\"then... ok.\"\\n\\nI\\'m really a boring person, these kinds of little skits, I don\\'t know how many of them I\\'ve played through in my mind. \\n\\nWhen I think back to the research group meeting that happened a couple of days ago, Dr. Z said we should think of patents as soon as possible (its considered an easy way to graduate in China, just make some improvements on existing patents) or the school won\\'t let you graduate. In response, Dr. H angrily spat \"we can\\'t allow then to use patents to graduate! we must make them publish papers! Patents are too easy, if we allow them to use patents to graduate that will water down our standards too much!!\". \\n\\nRemember that all us students were listening because this was an online meeting, at the time i was tired and pulling an all nighter doing my PPT. When i heard what Dr. H said, I muted my mic and laughed bitterly out loud, I was wide awake then. \\n\\nTo be honest, I think that Dr. H‘s requirements were reasonable, our research group was honestly really laid back, before COVID we didn\\'t even have research group meetings. Other than our supervisors treating us to a meal once a year and taking the graduating masters students each year on a trip every year, they never took initiative to see how we were doing. But, I\\'m sorry, maybe its me that couldn\\'t meet your standards and requirements, if the school returned the half of the year that I lost to COVID, i might be ok. But, at this point, looking at my experiment data, all i can see is hopelessness and more hopelessness. Maybe I\\'m too stupid, maybe I\\'m too lazy, or maybe those few apparatuses that I used weren\\'t sufficient for me to use to conduct research. All in all, our research group has yet to have even one student have their graduation delayed. To not break our research group\\'s fine tradition, it would be best for me to disappear. Its good that our country is really struggling with this issue this year, I for one won\\'t put additional stress on our country. I think that the kind of person I am won\\'t meet the requirements of being a civil servant either and service the people of our nation. \\n\\nIf there are any usable portions of my body left, please take them away. Please cremate me and bury me in any old piece of dirt. For better or worse I\\'ll be able to contribute some nutrition to that piece of ground. \\n\\nThank you, Thank you for reading til now. I\\'m actually a really introverted person, this is the first time that I\\'ve poured out so much to anyone.\\n\\nWhen I think of the times that I donated 1 RMB (0.15 USD) each time that I ordered delivery.

It not only makes me reflect on my life as a student. But, it also makes me think of the difference in attitude between the students back home in Canada and in China. \\n\\nI see alot of anti-Chinese hate on reddit and maybe the hate is warranted. But, I look at this person (who is the same age as me) and I don\\'t see much evil here. \\n\\nI hope that you guys read this and can gain some insight into life in China and see that these are individuals (1.4 billion of them in fact) and not hate every Chinese person equally. \\n\\nPS: this translation might be a little iffy because the guy wrote this write before hanging himself, so the tenses are a little bit confused (i.e. he jumps between past and present tense sometimes in the same sentence) and Chinese doesn\\'t have past or present tense as we know it.', nan, nan, nan, nan, 'I didn’t know where else to go trigger warning suicide I’m losing it.

I was not lucky and I did not receive any high fives. When I was in 2nd grade my teacher used to get me in trouble which would result in detention with her where she would undress me and make me do things I didn\\'t want to do. Or at the time even understood.\\n\\nIt really kind of messed with me because I was constantly getting in trouble. Like serious trouble with the school and with my parents.  I\\'m actually not sure what was worse, always being in trouble, usually for things I didn\\'t do!, or actually getting molested by her.\\n\\nLater in the 4th grade that teacher moved to teach 4th grade instead of 2nd and got me again where she did the same thing.  That year I got into really serious trouble with the school and I remember some of the kids in my class picked up on what was going on so they\\'d \"tell on me\" and then laugh when I got in trouble.

Fast forward a year, we get purchased by a competitor and in roll the changes. \\n\\nIn the year I was there, we put down 4 MAYBE 5 dogs and fired 2 people.

They also now put down on average 2-3 dogs every other week, sometimes simply because they don\\'t want to deal with them. We used to have long term \"residents\" and after spending 6 months in the shelter on anxiety meds for stress, finally found the dog a home and our new vet director cut him off completely from his anxiety meds. Well guess what? The dog freaked out, had a panic attack and ran out and got hit by a car 3 days in his new home.

I hope this doesn’t get removed, we need help! \\n\\nLong story: my bother knocked up his side chick when he was 18 and she was 17. Both still in high school. He tried to do right by her by letting her live with him and my dad and stepmom. Got a good paying job and eventually got them an apartment. He paid for everything, bought her anything she wanted. After the baby came was when all the issues started. Eventually they broke up, but she just went off the deep end. My brother is a good looking guy and a huge flirt. To say he’s innocent and did nothing wrong would just not be true. However, he’s never done anything to hurt his ex. The first issue I can remember is the baby mama getting a restraining order on him because he had a gun and was selling drugs and he supposedly threaten her. When the authorities came, they found NOTHING! My brother works in the trades so he makes good money, he also works 12+ hrs and usually comes home tired. He’s a huge goof ball and barely has a temper. IMO his main and probably only flaw is he’s a man-hoe lol we all know it and the chick new it (hello she KNEW she was the side and forced my brother to leave his girlfriend). The restraining order was eventually dropped and then the custody battles started. When my niece was around 2, the mom called CPS on brother saying that he was touching his daughter. That too was eventually dropped, but the report stated that the child may have been coached. Over the next 2.5 years, the mom continued to tried to get my brother in trouble with the law and has issued multiple restraining orders on him... everything being inconclusive or dropped!! This most recent time (the daughter is now about to be 6). The mom again called CPS in two different counties saying that he is touching her daughter. She called him saying “are you touching Kim (daughter’s name changed for obvious reasons) on her pussy lips” and of course my brother is outraged saying no what is wrong with you! When one county CPS goes to question the mom and daughter, the daughter this time says “daddy’s touching me”. This time CPS and authorities need to do a thorough investigation because the daughter actually said it. However in the other county, she also tried to file a restraining order but the judge rejected. This judge happened to be the same judge in their first custody hearing battle and saw the pattern of this awful evil person. Sadly, my brother has had his custody temporarily suspended pending investigation. This crazy person has even gotten our other family members involved because we all once tried to help them both. This evil woman has caused people to have their jobs in question!! Now my brother wont be able to even see his daughter for months! I found out through another family member that happens to be acquaintance with the baby momma that she’s trying to win full custody so she can move back to Brazil with the daughter. This has been going on for 6 years and my family is tired of being victimized and sitting back and letting this terrible girl do these things. My stepmom’s fear is the mental trauma this will cause on my niece. We’re all at a loss and we don’t trust the system to serve justice. Has anyone ever been in this situation?

It is my hope that this exposé would encourage and advocate for the mental health that police officers are so desperately in need of.***\\xa0\\n\\nThe pit in my stomach seemed to have been caused by a vacuuming effect directly related to the hard, hateful look in his cold blue eyes. He hated me. In that moment and in so many others, he hated me. I think I was about ten when I realized there was something truly, disturbingly wrong with my father. He seemed to only find satisfaction in exerting power and control, but also wanted to be seen as a man of knowledge and concern for the world and the people in it. His eyes were boring a hole into me. He had just gotten in my face, his cigarette breath and saliva spewing at me because I had made the mistake of answering his question wrong. Or maybe the tone of my voice wasn’t respectful enough. Who knows? I would worry about that later. Right now my mind was concerned about where my siblings were and if they were tucked away in their rooms so they wouldn’t have to see this.\\xa0\\n\\nI had been walking through the kitchen to get breakfast. He was in a bad mood. The empty diet soda he had in his hand was my first signal. Crap. \\xa0Some people shouldn’t ingest certain chemicals. Whatever was wrong with his brain was heightened when he drank aspartame. He told me to grab him another one. Maybe I sighed and didn’t realize it. If I had a dime for every time my siblings and I had to get him coffee, soda, or the cigarettes he had left somewhere, I could have started all our college funds. He was looking for a fight. From his recliner in the living room he watched the news, sighing his sharp, exasperated anger that made me shiver. Maybe something on TV triggered him. I didn’t really care, I just knew it was going to be bad when he asked if I had done the dishes yet. It was a Saturday morning. I had waited as long as I could to get breakfast, hoping he would fall asleep in the recliner so I could quietly do the dishes and grab toaster tarts to take back to my room. But the dishes weren’t done yet, and, “I came to do them now,” was not the answer he wanted to hear. He stood up. His short build, the epitome of Napoleon\\'s Syndrome. But still, he was taller than me.\\xa0\\n\\nThere would be no crescendo of anger because his anger didn’t grow. It just happened. From 0 to 160 in the blink of an eye. No warning. Just, this is happening. A litany of questions and accusations were fired my way that my brain couldn’t process, so I didn’t answer. For over an hour all his focus was put on belittling me, my laziness, my lack of importance, and how hard he worked to give us nice things. Phrases like, “How are you going to be successful at life if you can’t even do the simple chores we give you?” “I work my ass off to give you kids a nice house and you don’t even take care of it.” “You’re lay-zy.” “You think you’re going to accomplish anything by being a fat ass that sits around the house all day?” “Oh that’s right… you’re going to be a psychologist. They sit on their asses all the time. That’s convenient for you.” Always more questions. Always belittling. Always in my face.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nHis logic was illogical. His words were cruel. His tone of voice was maniacal. But it was the gaslighting and mind games he played that seemed to cause the most damage to my family of seven. I was the oldest and it was my job to keep the other kids out of his line of fire. But sometimes I couldn’t. Sometimes I didn’t have the courage to take blame for something I didn’t do. Sometimes I didn’t want to stand for so long that my feet left impressions in the carpet. So sometimes I didn’t take the blame, and for that, more than twenty years later, I will always feel shame and regret.\\n\\nHe was a part-time cop and nice guy. He was a full-time salesman and bully. He was a charismatic man, not overly attractive, but powerful in his words. He and my mother would sit around their dining room table with friends and strangers alike, making suggestions and offering counsel that those people would forever be grateful for. But those friends and strangers didn’t know. They had no idea the man so smooth and smart was a cruel and demeaning man behind closed doors. How could they? He wore a badge on the weekends. Helped out victims of abuse and car accidents. There was never any outward indication that the father who paid such close attention to my friends and their interests, who seemed to genuinely care about their career goals, would mock my dreams of social work and law school, reminding me how no jury would ever be convinced by an overweight attorney with acne scars.\\xa0\\n\\nOne of his favorite *games* was, “Let’s See if they’re Lying.” The irony of this game was none of us innocent bystanders knew that while he was interrogating our virginity, choice of friends, and schedules, he was a serial cheater on both our mother and our family for fifteen years. (A note to self that would have been helpful all those years ago: What they accuse you of, they are almost always guilty of.) The game was simple, the rules were hella hard. Sit down. Answer questions. For hours. The interrogation would be a repeat of the same questions. “Why are you lying?” “Where did you really go after church?” “Why are you crying?” “If you’d just be honest, this would all be over.” “Where were you?” “Why didn’t you answer your phone?” “Who were you with?” I often thought in my own head, ‘If he really wants the truth, why doesn’t he just track my mileage. Then he’d know.’ But that’s the thing, he didn’t want to know I was being truthful. He wanted mind games that were so crazy I would never be able to think my way out of them. It was like a labyrinth for the brain and there were no clues as to where the right turn might be.\\xa0 And the topic of interrogation wasn’t just where we had been. That would have been easy to fix, just don’t go anywhere. No, the interrogations had huge variations. When things went missing from the house, like when he misplaced his keys or cell phone and surely one of us must have taken them, or the topic of career and college, music choices, or whether we had completed all our chores that day.\\xa0\\n\\nAnother of his favorites was a sick game I used to call, “Meal Time for the Anorexic,” because sitting around a meal as a “family” was so nauseating you would have to throw up afterwards. I never did understand how someone who had a taste for nicotine and tobacco could distinguish between a meal that tasted good and didn’t, but he was the family food critic, and had something to say about every. single. meal. He would ridicule and critique my mother’s cooking with every bite and expect us kids to always agree. And if we tried to protect my mother’s feelings because in reality, it was pretty damn good, we were viciously turned against. For a long time, I couldn’t watch cooking competitions.\\xa0\\n\\nOn top of the cruel food critiquing, there was an incident with my sister and a steak knife that left all of us scarred. She was six and didn’t know how to slice steak. He thought it would be a good idea to teach her. It escalated quickly when she was too intimidated by his cruelty and the sharpness of the knife, and the fear we all had, that he was going to stab her with it. Fifteen years later my sister still doesn’t know how to cut steak, and in fact has become a vegetarian. These were not one time incidents over our dinner table, these were consistent. These were our meals. This was our life.\\n\\nAfter he decided we’d been through enough, that we were never going to give him the truth, or that we were never going to measure up, we were dismissed to our rooms. There were times I barely had the mental capacity to move my legs up the stairs. It felt like all the neurons in my brain had been stolen because nothing would fire. There was no thought left in my head. I remember laying in my bed so many times, trying to focus on basic addition and there was nothing there. There was no energy left to move. No emotion left to be mad. No capacity left to cry. No self-justification or defense I even wanted to come up with in my own head. I would just lay there, numb. Even now, all these years later, I can’t feel anything about what happened to me. My brain is in automatic apathy mode for the interrogations and events I lived through.\\n\\nOh, but I do have anger. The anger is for the sisters I watched get berated because I hadn’t stepped in in time. The anger that still courses through me every time I think of my sister’s pale, blood-drained faces as he screamed at them how lazy and stupid they were. I have anger toward myself for not taking blame when I could have. For not being the one to stand there in the bathroom when he found a used tampon that missed the trashcan and hadn’t been retrieved. It wasn’t mine, but I could have lied. I’m still angry at my mom for never doing something about it. Something real. Something that could have ended it. Her half-ass arguments to try and get him to stop the abuse did nothing. And we girls were just supposed to accept it. And when it was over, we were instructed to get over it. By her. Our mother. I’m angry that, after the particularly bad events, when my mother would suggest he get mental help, he refused. Citing, “That will\\xa0 ruin my police career.” As if a career-a part time job, mind you- was more important than his family. As if a stigma-a false stigma- he fed into, was more important than his own well-being. I’m still angry that no one in the law enforcement realm, no superior or equal evaluated his mental state. And I worried every time he strapped that gun on his hip that he would lose his cool around a criminal the way he did around us kids. But my family is lucky. We are lucky that we don’t have to live knowing our family member was responsible for another case of police brutality or killed a citizen\\xa0 in the line of duty.\\xa0\\n\\nAfter being mentally and emotionally abused by him when I was young, and then physically assaulted by him later, I can honestly say I think I would have preferred scars and bruises to the things he did to my mind. The bullying, the weird mind games I didn’t have the right answers to. No way of telling when the yelling and berating would end. I guess he chose to end them when he felt he’d made his point of superior intellect known. And that’s the real difference between a physical abuser and a mental abuser. Physical abuse takes nothing but fists. You don’t have to be smart to hit someone. Or even bigger. But I often recall the look in his eyes when he was on a roll with me or one of my sisters. A gloating, cold satisfaction that with his brain, he had the power. Because how can your victim win a battle of wits when logic isn’t an equation?\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How can a victim prove that you are destroying their spirit and emotionally abusing them when there are no scars? If I have no scars, they have no proof. And if you have a badge, I have no voice. There were countless times I wanted to call someone. But I knew at an early age how the boy’s club worked. I knew one cop would show up to another cop’s house and commiserate with him about “family life.” I wish I had a team of armed men that had my back. I wish my siblings had had that. I wish criminals who are laid in the prone position, handcuffs behind their backs, had that.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You hear abuse victims say all the time that they never did anything or told anyone because the authorities would never believe that their slick, charismatic abuser would be capable of hurting anyone. Now imagine that the abuser is also an authority figure. You’re basically screwed.\\n\\n“There is a fine line between a cop and a criminal.” I used to believe this with all my heart. Because I’m convinced that what he did to us, the emotional, physical, and mental abuse, was criminal. But now, I know that the fine line between a cop and a criminal, grows as an officer receives proper mental health. Hurt people, hurt people. Being a police officer cannot be used as an excuse to avoid seeking help for mental health. Being a cop should be the reason for seeking help.\\xa0\\n\\nI think most of us have a side of ourselves we try to hide from the outside world. This is a sad, but natural state for most people in the first world. But for some, those more mentally unhealthy, this “secret identity” is another thing entirely, and it is usually caused by unmanaged trauma. These people become the villain whose own secrets drive them to inflict hell on those beneath them. The blurred images of who they are part time and who they are most of the time become one mess, and they turn into people who can’t begin to hold normal relationships with anyone.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd what happens to your morals and character when you can’t have positive relationships? Your view on humanity declines. Eventually people’s humanity is no longer precious. Life is no longer honored or respected, and it becomes easier for the mentally ill to treat themselves as superior and under no obligation to give people the dignity they deserve simply because they are alive. They understand the art of manipulation, and their mind games that leave the normal person sick and tortured are a form of abuse they take enjoyment in. Slap a badge on this person, hand them a gun, and call them “law enforcement,” and you have a recipe for disaster.\\xa0\\n\\nThis is exactly what happened to the man I no longer call father. He was a victim too once, abused in all manners of sick ways by people let into his life. His tumultuous childhood was a recipe for psychosis. And the lies he later told himself and his family added to his past traumas. As a police officer he saw and dealt with the dead bodies of innocent victims. Filed reports on victims of heinous crimes. Had to sit across from the families of abusers. He systematically piled trauma on top of trauma without ever dealing with any of it. That’s not an excuse. Mental health is only a defense when you actively sought help for it. But it is a reason. It’s a reason people are dying at the hands of those in authority. A big reason. I have a bachelors in criminology and I now work in social work, helping children deal with trauma. And I believe with every fiber of my being, that if he had gotten help for his mental problems, he wouldn’t have been so evil.\\n\\nIt’s taken me a very long time to dismiss the words and deeds he put on me and my sisters. But I no longer see myself as the burdensome, fat, good-for-nothing spawn he so often made me feel like. I understand his treatment of me was a reflection that his mental illness had put in front of him, protecting him from what he really thought of himself. And it would be so easy for me to agree with him. To say, “Yes, you ARE a burdensome, fat, good for nothing man who has never amounted to anything .” But that’s not my heart to him. My mother says I hate him and asks why I don’t love him. My reply, “I’ve learned that hate is not the opposite of love.\\xa0 Indifference is the opposite of love.\" Hate takes a level of caring that my forgiveness has freed me from. Hate is malicious, but it’s still a level of concern. My forgiveness of his actions has freed me of all concern for him. Positive or otherwise. I don’t wish ill upon him. I hope he can live his life and get the help he needs.\\n\\nI wrote this in an attempt, not to show myself as the victim, or to demonize yet another cop, but to show the importance of supplying our police departments with much needed mental health trainings. I advocate for intense, regular, and mandatory mental health evaluations throughout the year. I advocate for the training of de-escalation techniques in all circumstances, even when the person needing to be de-escalated is the cop himself. I advocate for mandatory therapies for all first responders. What they do is hard, traumatic, and important.

Me and M aren\\'t friends in the slightest, when we talk is straight to the point communicating about need for house appliances or concerns about something in the apartment (es. Mold creeping up from behind the kitchen counter). \\n\\n\\nG and I don\\'t get along very well, and usually it results with G and M coupling against me for whatever reason G could find to blame me and F not taking part in the conflict (between the 3 of them F is the one I have the best relationship with). For example a pan got slightly redder in colour and G asked me if I knew anything about it in an inquisitory tone, as if she already decided I was the culprit, and even when F admitted she burned some bread on it G kept talking and behaving as if I burned the pan.\\n\\n\\nThis is just an example that happened 2 weeks ago, but there are other instances, another would ve when she didn\\'t want me to use the kettle (mind you, that\\'s mine, they obviously can use it without asking, but still it\\'s mine) because I was \"sick\" (just a sore throat), this was 1 week ago. Or today when she asked me if \"I was done eating\" when I was having lunch (like, wtf, what\\'s even her point), it\\'s not like I was even occupying all the table or all the pans and pots, I already washed everything but the plate I was eating from.\\n\\n\\nBoth F and I are very shy, so we don\\'t talk much even when we\\'re alone in the apartment (luckily it\\'s usually us two when it\\'s just me and another flatmate). Sometime I text her, asking how her day went and so on, while she answer, sometimes enthusiastically, she never initiates conversation. To her credit though sometimes she invites me when the 3 of them organise something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow there\\'s another group of \"friends\": 2 guys (1 cis, A, and 1 trans, S) and 1 girl (L). S and L live together, while A lives in a structure made for students, since he lives near S\\'s university they usually hang out together.\\n\\n\\nWe had a vacation planned for this summer, going to Spain by car (we are from Italy), but it was postponed due to L\\'s dad not feeling well and sge wanted to stay with him, which would be understandable if she didn\\'t go 1 week to Paris with another group of friends and 1 week to another city in Italy (I won\\'t mention it because it\\'s where her GF lives, so privacy). She decided to postpone it before organising those things. It was than postponed again (this time indefinitely) when we should have gone in the first week of October.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure summer 2024 S, L and A are going to re-propose the Spain trip but I don\\'t know if I want to commit to it seeing it was already delayed two times. Also since Spain was chosen because L was graduating and it was our gift to her, and she kinda \"burned it\", and this year I\\'m the one that\\'s gonna graduate (Bachelor\\'s degree in physics) I\\'d rather something like Greece, and I\\'m even open to going alone, however I don\\'t know how to tell my parents because they\\'ll be upset if I go alone.\\n\\n\\nI asked S and L if we could hang out because I needed to vent about stuff that happened in the flat with G and M (those 2 things mentioned earlier and others). Initially S ghosted me from Wednesday to Sunday, than Monday messaged me saying she didn\\'t saw our chat because she had a lot of messages and it fell down on the WhatsApp log and that she was sorry. So we scheduled for this Thursday evening (today). I should have gone to theirs for dinner and stay the night.\\n\\n\\nHowever L sent me a voice note saying that others friends asked them for Thursday evening so they would be free from 11 pm after dinner. This made me angry and very sad, because a lot of times when I asked to hang out they said they had other plans, but now that I was the first to ask I still got put as second and not first in the priority list. In the end we didn\\'t hang out at all.\\n\\n\\nPartially my fault because considering the distance that I would have to travel by bike and weather (~15 minutes in rain and 12° C) it was undoable without risking some serious fever, so I called out. But I still feel like they should have put our hangout first because I asked first, and those friends of theirs after. They also said that \"they were there if I needed them\" but it certainly doesn\\'t feel like it given the circumstances.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m also the only one of the group to not have ever had a lover and still a virgin. And things aren\\'t looking good on that side: tinder is kinda impossible with an alt guy profile, and I don\\'t know where I could meet new people.\\n\\n\\n\\n(TLDR, kinda) So in the end my flat is an hostile environment (neutral at best) and my other \"friends\" always consider me as second or third or worse option. I have an history of self harm and I\\'m actively resisting the urge to cut right now. Also have suicidal thoughts and have a \"plan\": just put aside a cup of Rum and a couple of aspirin and ibuprofen to mix with it. Kinda think about it from time to time. I don\\'t know how things are going to develop from here on out, but I certainly feel as lonely and lost as ever.

For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn’t go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn’t so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren’t fun why do people go to them all the time? \\n\\nInstead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.\\n\\nThese are the same people who went insane under quarantine.

Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.  A broke kid who got a 1570 on his SAT but could only manage to get a 2.1 in college and on the verge of losing everything I’ve worked towards my entire life, lonely and losing the one thing that made me happy.  I don’t really care if anyone reads this or not but I had to get all my feelings out because everyday I wake up and just cry.

Some might be miserable but a majority I’m sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.\\n\\nThey tell us that friends, social events etc aren’t that fun and we aren’t missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn’t go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn’t so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren’t fun why do people go to them all the time? \\n\\nInstead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.\\n\\nThese are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems \\n\\nThis is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don’t get help. Even if they knew you won’t stigmatize them for being depressed they still won’t talk to you knowing you’ll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. \\n\\nThis is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people “trying” to prevent suicide/depression.', 'Lonely, broke, depressed, and it’s my birthday Today is my 28th birthday.

My friend recently got a girlfriend and I am very jealous of him. Even more jealous is how cute she is. I wish she is my girl. Before he got this gf we never talk about women at all because I try to avoid talking about it due to how embarrassing it is when others know I have never had a girl in my life, not even a kiss or sex. I don’t want people to know that I am an incel given that I actually have a respectable job and income and a graduate degree too.

Don't even risk showing your face online unless you wanna become a meme and get reposted. (this happened to me several times.) And finally get ready for the opposite gender seeing you as a joke and pretending to be attracted you for shits and giggles.

Hi everyone. I am a 20-year-old male. Recently. I have been feeling down without any upsetting event in my life. I am currently in uni and today is my birthday. Since finishing high school and starting uni, my life has been same, repetitive and boring. All I do is go to uni, study, do my assignments, work and go to gym. I haven't made any new friends and I frankly beleive I lost the ability to make new friends. I miss my old friends from high school as we have drifted apart. All of them have a full time job and they have made new friends. Its not like we hate each other. If I made a plan to hangout, they will join and we would have a blast. But the problem is that its always me who is making a plan and organising it. They dont make plans and I see them on social media with new friends having fun. Also its not like I am a quiet person, I have talked to a lot of people in uni but out of class we don't talk to each other. I see people in uni grounds with their friends and it is so strange to me as why cant i make friends. And why people dont come talk to me like i talk to them. Also my second issue is I cant seem to get a girlfriend. I have never dated anyone. And as Im getting older I am starting to panick whether I will die alone. People say just talk to her and I have. I just dont how to attract them while talking as they seem to just talk I guess. Id say I am an average looking male and I have seen people who are uglier than me have gf.

The \\'jobs\\' I\\'ve had have nothing to do with my art, other than them giving me a sustainable way to live and eat. I\\'ve hit rock bottom then bounced a bit and landed back on the bottom and am currently sinking into the ground without any forsite to a remotely positive future.

I don\\'t know what to do and Im too stubborn to let go of my music and go 100% into some bullshit career like a fucking management position at a restaurant or something that pays an average livable wage that would make me comfortable. Why is it so hard for me to be able to eat.. live.. and write music.. that combined with occasional recreational activities like rock climbing, skateboarding, and surfing sounds like the absolute ideal life. And yet. I\\'ve been living in my parents spare bedroom with my PC on an old vanity mirror sitting on a stool continuing to write music, occasionaly getting out to do said activities, or work odd jobs for little to no money before being fired. Stealing an internet connection from tethering my rooted phones hotspot so it thinks I\\'m using mobile data. My family is somewhat wealthy, my grandparents have a large real estate property, but my grandmother has no idea what it is I do. Everyone in my family looks at me as if I do not work and am unmotivated, slob, mooching off my parents. My father continues to ask and tell me that he \\'doesnt know what I want to do\\'. I want to make a living from my art,but ultimately I want to live in my bliss, writing music but not being a burden to those around me.\\n\\nI want to catch a break, I worked so fucking hard in my 20s and the only thing I have left to show for all the work I did is pieces of music that my family members don\\'t understand.

I tend to feel more lonely than usual and I tend to feel like i haven't accomplished anything in my life. However,  my therapist has recommended me to keep some type of journal only meant for the good things that I have experienced my life which I do plan on trying to do. Keeping a journal is hard for me because I don't really like to write so I made a second Instagram so that way I could also have photos of the good times and I can write whatever i would want in the caption. I do have a good life. I travel very frequently, I have been to all of the states west of the rocky mountains, I have been to most countries in Central America, I have a supportive family and I get along with all my siblings despite the large age gaps I have with them, and I am getting a degree in a subject I am passionate about. But these feelings of being lonely and inadequate truly cripple me into long depressive episodes where I don't always feel like the things I have done hold any meaning. I only have two friends, but they are both in committed relationships and it is honestly so hard for us to even attempt to get together, not to mention we don't always talk to each other as frequently as we used to.

I don\\'t know what to do.\\n\\n\"Go take a shower, freshen up, make yourself pretty.\" Done that; I still feel hollow. Even worse, making myself or feeling prettier reminds me of the hollowness I feel when sleazy men with ulterior motives makes me feel like Barbie. \\n\\nImagine only being desirable because you\\'re relatively young, supposedly pretty or sexy cos you\\'re young and vulnerable. \\n\\nIt\\'s so sad and very disturbing how so many of us come from troubled backgrounds that we end up seeking or chasing after that sense of security we never got. In some people, the sense of security is such a foreign concept or feeling that they can\\'t do without cortisol. \\n\\nI\\'m overly stretched out and just beaten having to accommodate people that are not exactly someone I\\'m comfortable with just out of courtesy because I don\\'t wanna hurt people either and as we\\'ve learned in preschool \"Do not do to others what you don\\'t want done to yourself.\" \\n\\nSo as much as some voices or opinions may say \"Just cut them off/Block them/State your part and Leave.\" Diplomacy must Exist when engaging socially. Because it\\'s a responsibility we all have and Being left in the dark without any closure or Reasoning is cruel. \\n\\nSo I try to find ways to soften the blow as it is a responsibility that I have to keep it professional and diplomatic as possible. \\n\\nMany tend to not take rejection nicely which is understandable. It\\'s sad. And no matter how poorly someone may have behaved, or simply incompatible you were with them, they may have had well, tried, and put themselves vulnerably out there. 2 big things I think children were not taught properly were 1. How to handle melt downs. 2. How to handle denial and rejection. That\\'s why often it leads to aggression, shockingly even in adults. Everything\\'s a trauma response.\\n\\nAs someone aware of this, I do not have any intention of feeding fuel to the fire and reinforcing the trauma they have by failing to let them know how it\\'s just how it is and diversity exists and so does differences and that they\\'re not necessarily bad, just that we\\'re incompatible. \\n\\nBut I\\'ve digressed. \\n\\nWhat do you do and how do you cope with isolation & depression because you just can\\'t move anymore. \\n\\nDrinking alcohol is obviously just going to make us feel worse, ruining our organs, body and just not helpful it\\'s the opposite of a solution. I never got to relate with it. I strive to be healthy in terms of avoiding junk food and these blatant hazards for health. \\n\\nI tried dance exercising while playing old jams but it soon feels hollow when you\\'re alone and for whatever reason the vitality exuding from dancing is somehow linked to sexuality or that kind of energy which just makes me even more put off. \\n\\nI read. I rewatch films and shows I connect with. They\\'re basically what\\'s keeping me sane xD\\n\\nI don\\'t really have the energy to tip toe and keep this large part of me now, and pretend otherwise and just try to make friends or whatever under the pretense of being okay cos that\\'s hollow itself. \\n\\nFriends are someone we relate with deeply and connect with. \\n\\nSo again, What do you do? \\n\\nI\\'m sorry, I absolutely hate sweating and the last time I decided to exercise this gross disturbing feeling out, the depression, I ended up getting sick the very next day lethargic with a fever and light headedness xD I also lost my voice for nearly a month. \\n\\nI\\'ve been trying yoga poses or half a pilates but I just really wish I had best friends or I don\\'t know, someone I can trust and count on. .\\n\\nSo how do you do it? \\n\\n(※ For some who may think \"detach, and stop with the me, me, me personalisation of things\", I find it so wonderful and heart warming that there are people who understands deeply having experienced the sensation and predicament first hand, while it\\'s also very tragic how any life form simply will not register an information until it becomes personal to them through experience. Exposure. Abuse.) \\n\\nTry - Colbie Caillat\\nHuman - Christina Perri\\nPerfect - P!nk \\nCigarettes after Sex Album and more. \\n\\nJust some music that comes to my mind when I read this from the top. Music helps? It\\'s a voice like shows and films. But having a special voice just for us through the intimacy we have with good friends is unbeatable. \\n\\nSo I hope those of you who feel the same way, lonely, isolated find that friendship you\\'re looking for. \\n\\nCos for me, I don\\'t know anymore. \\n\\nHow do I go on about this? \\nI\\'d like something genuine with someone who\\'s sincere.\\n\\nBut do you feel disgusted, too, kind of yourself for basically being depressed even though it\\'s supposedly normal, just cos we\\'re not presentable in our current state? And that keeping us from feeling comfortable socialising because why the hell would anyone want to have anything to do with us? It\\'s patronising perhaps as considerate as it is, but In theory, the companionship or relatability we may be able to offer them could be enough. But we live in a harsh society full of judgements and criticism. And that is normal. Human society is complex and diverse. I say so, because there are things I personally wouldn\\'t feel very comfortable with, as well. That\\'s why I find studying eusocial animals intriguing. Fascinating. Maybe the animal kingdom can teach us a thing or two about management? btw I love nature related documentaries xD\\n\\nIt got really long, I\\'m sorry. \\n\\nBut I hope you find your answers and I hope some people may offer wholesome things that cheered them up or how they cope and such. \\n\\nI journal, too. \\n\\nAnd then I came across a random short on YouTube about a stressed out librarian lady who had two little boys with chaotic energy coming in, asking for two copies of the same book because they were going to stay up and read them on their sleepover and that was so wholesome and adorable. \\n\\nBasically, there are still positive things that encourages optimism. \\n\\nSo if you have similar stories, Please Share. \\n\\nThose of us who will see it may smile about it xD ☺️ \\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read. \\nI wish you a lovely day, then :) \\n\\nOr a good night. \\n\\nPlease take care and I hope it wasn\\'t too vexing a perspective to read.', 'I feel so lonely at Uni.

(Eating disorder trigger warning) I’ve noticed that most of my mental illnesses come from being lonely and desperate.\\n\\nThe main problem that is bothering me is an extreme body dysmorohia and eating disorders.\\n\\nIt feels like if I get skinny or fit enough people will notice me and sadly it is true.\\n\\nIn my life I basically had two “glow ups”. I’ll explain... :\\nFirst one was when I was pretty much a kid 13-14yo. I was overweight until 13 - my only friends were food and video games and when all of that teenagery puberty bullshit hit and bullying started I became body dysmorphic and went to extreme anorexia type weight loss. I was actually sick, like my body was fucked up by so much weight loss, but I loved how people commented on how good I looked... I was finally seen for the first time. Girls wanted to be like me, asked for tips, tried to befriend me. Guys were pretty immature at the time (still somehow at that “ew girls” phase in my class) but still showed more attention to me AND what was the most fucked up thing is that teachers even praised my weight loss too (remember the fact that I was anorexic thin, not just skinny...).\\n\\nAnyways life hit me, I had to recover and I swung to the other side of pendulum - I was going through hard time and I started binge eating and seeling comfort in food again. That of course lead me to weight gain. And you guessed it! People just wanished. No more skinny me - no more interest from others. I tried to go back to being skinny which lead me to have binge and restrict cycles. Some people even made fun of me that I gained weight. I developed social anxiety which just made everything even worse - I actually ended up homeschooled because I just couldnt be in public places anymore. It continued till i was 17. \\n\\nOn 2019 I managed to “get back to it”. Started working out again. This time I lost weight in a bit more healthy way, but still it was pretty extreme. At the start of 2020 I was lean and fit. And you guessed it! I got compliments from people again. This time tho - it was my neighbors from my neighborhood. They told me how I was a little thick in the past and how good I looked now. I even ended up with a girlfriend from dating app and I got lots of attention from random guys (I am a lesbian but I still enjoyed that).\\nFast forward to september - i had a slip up and emotional break down - binge eating again, all weight back up again, same fucking people ignoring me again. Loneliness again...\\n\\nIm seriously contemplaiting on starving myself now again. Im still in my binge eating period but the loneliness and mean people are getting old to me...\\n\\nHas anyone here been through something similar?', 'Weird after-effect of asking a girl out and getting rejected So, I\\'m pretty sure it gave me split personality disorder. Or at least made it noticeable, because I had been doing some strange things for a while before. But I got so sad and so fed up with having the lizard brain in me constantly fantasize about a better life I could never have, and I begged it to stop as if it were a second entity in my head. To my great surprise, it listened to me, and agreed to stop. Its been doing its best, still relapsing sometimes, but only briefly. And its also considerably more sad and regretful about what happened than whatever I call \"me\" is. The one typing now. I really don\\'t know how to explain this aside from some sort of mental disorder. I asked my sister to what degree she talks to her subconsciousness, and she said she has \"full conversations\" . But I think she just meant she has an inner monologue, because she was quite startled by what I described.\\n\\nAmyways, with the fantasizing gone, my mind is sooooo much more empty. Its like someone\\'s taken all the furniture out of a house. At first it was fun, I had space to run around and think about and care about whatever I wanted. But its starting to get boring. It still feels like nothing except love could possibly be worth focusing on. So I guess that\\'s a feature of the \"me\" part of me, not the second entity. Which is very surprising.', \"Misconception when ppl hear schizoid personality disorder, they automatically think SCHIZOPHRENIC. i really, really, REALLY wish ppl would either educate themselves about it, or even better, ask ME about it. there is a HUGE difference between the 2. HUGE!! matter of fact, they're not even close (or related) to eachother, and they're not even in the same cluster of groups for personality/mental disorder/s. \\n\\nNEVER has anybody associated w/me been in danger. NEVER have i heard/seen things that wasn't there. NEVER have i *blacked out* and went into an episode. NEVER have i been in jail/hospitalized because of my disorder.\\n\\n\\nSomething very real that happened though was CPS was called on me years ago because of a misconception. for a week they visited my house daily. interrogated my child, got into my personal business (therapy visits, family interviews, drug tests, etc.), scared my daughter to death (because they told her she would be taken if anything came back false), and caused an even bigger rift between me and what little bit of family i did have left. \\n\\nthe only thing about my disorder that might be considered *crippling* or *odd* is the fact i long for and can thrive with ZERO outside interaction. I'm not bothered by not having friends. I'm not bothered by the fact i never leave the house (when i DID have a home; outside of work, when i did work, i would go MONTHS without leaving). I'm not bothered by not having close, meaningful relationships, to be perfectly frank, I'm not bothered by having nobody. that's literally all that means. i am 100% content and happy with it being JUST ME, or just me and MY DAUGHTER. \\n\\ni know it probably sounds sad and depressing, but i am 100% content having nobody. HOWEVER, it doesn't mean I'm a dick to people either. I'm pretty intelligent, so I'm decent at carrying conversation, I'm really good at faking my *social personality* so i laugh at appropriate times, feign concern if needed, ask questions to seem interested/engaged, and basically just act like your average, empathetic female. it's completely draining when i do do that so that's why i would reserve that personality for work. \\n\\nBut, in a nutshell, that's it. that's all schizoid personality disorder is. if everybody in the world (with the exception of my daughter of course) disappeared i would be absolutely content. i don't go insane if i can't talk to somebody, i don't start hallucinating ppl because I'm alone for days at a time, i don't need ppl to stay sane.\", 'Can you rely on \"general symptoms\" for some \"DIY diagnose\"?

Always worrying about being wrong in the most trifling things and overthinking about them for days, or even weeks.

Stick with me here, for a mini timeline for reference. Also I’m 29F.\\n\\n1. Born into mental illness, extreme family trauma and abuse, and poverty. \\n\\n2. Contracted viral meningitis at 6 months, got a TBI that wasn’t picked up on until 20+ years old.\\n\\n3. Good to note that my mother started me in therapy consistently at 10. \\n\\n4. Homeless after family explosion\\n\\n5. Used as a token to play tug of war with from all adults, while under 18. None of needs met.\\n\\n6. Graduated high school, was extremely ill with mental disorders that manifest physically, yadda yadda. \\n\\n7. Placement in various hospitals and programs\\n\\n8. Learned that I learn differently and poured everything into my college education. I graduated with a BA. \\n\\n9. Other people almost took my life.\\n\\n10. The last hospital, they gave me ECT, Electroconvulsive therapy. \\n\\n11. I have been trying to understand, re learn, and live life again, but now with persistent everyday short term memory loss, Aphasia, and some long term memory loss. As well as initial problems, including emotional dysregulation.   \\n——\\n\\nSo basically that list gives a teeny tiny bit of background. I was always a people pleaser to survive. I’ve been in and out of many treatments, always do therapy. \\n\\nI used to be able to do so many things. I was incredibly smart. I worked very hard and put in blood, sweat, and tears. \\n\\nBut it was making me crazy because of all of the underlying trauma. \\n\\nIt came to an emergent head, and the only option given to me was ECT, I have gone through all other options. \\n\\nThe point of this post is that I am more isolated than I have ever been in life. \\n\\nI try to talk about things and have memory issues, then emotional issues, and it’s gone. \\n\\nWriting seems easier because I can take an hour to write, like in this post, use google for words, etc.\\n\\nWhen things come back in my memory that I was trying to talk about before, I can’t interrupt others, once I can talk, it’s gone. \\n\\nThings make me cringe hard that didn’t used to, like too much light, noise, anything..and I can’t think.

In that time I've been reflecting on myself as a person and all of the mistakes I made in every one of my failed relationships, a lot of which I made repeatedly. I realize now that my mental illness (bipolar disorder) coupled with my childhood/upbringing led me to become a very combative person who is simply incapable of being in a relationship.

Of course, all these interactions end with me getting hurt. Back in 2019, I met a Russian-American woman studying in Europe. I ended up getting attached to her and she tells me she loves and cares about me and that I’m the best thing that has ever happened to her. Then, she ghosts me for another man and marries him. When I confronted her, she said that her husband had the money to fly her back to the US and I didn’t and she turned everything around on me and said it was my fault for getting attached.

There are days I will love myself and be proud of the hardships I’ve overcome and endured and then others where I hate the way I look and disregard any achievement I have made in life. This especially happens when comparing myself to others online. I’ve had terrible relationships to okay relationships. The most recent one is a divorce from my ex whom I was very attached to. He treated me quite poorly and I didn’t set boundaries until recently which had led to divorce. I find myself comparing myself to his ex and his friends and their girlfriends etcetera. I don’t know why I spend so much time comparing myself to validate self worth. I definitely don’t compare in looks by any means. I’m quite ugly and I accept it some days and other days refuse to accept it. I’ve had surgery done to my face. I’m looking into other cosmetic procedures however they are quite expensive. I lost a lot of weight from stress and poor genetics. I had enough and decided to remove myself from social media. Has anyone ever done this before? How do you cope with being completely offline, I find it difficult as I have this belief that a lot of my inspiration, news, and supposed feeling of connectivity comes from social media. Although I’m pretty convinced now my presence online has a very opposite effect. I don’t feel well informed about the world around me, but sure, I feel more informed. I don’t feel inspired seeing gorgeous women, I feel discouraged. When I see what people I know are up to it’s nice to be updated I suppose, but why do I care? I question my self worth quite a bit. I don’t think I’m particularly unique. I’m maybe a little above average when it comes to intelligence. I have very often been among the top few students in my classes (and this is also despite the issues I had going on in my home life as kid.).Kudos to me. Based on somewhat credible iq tests I have an iq ranging from 118-140. That only means so much since an iq test is based only on how fast your brain recognizes a pattern. I wouldn’t say I’m that knowledgeable at least for my age. Mature maybe or so I’ve been told. I’m 20 yrs old F. My memory is quite limited due to my drug and alcohol abuse in high school. I haven’t been on medications recently for mental health reasons but probably should be on something. Recently I have found myself reading into psychology and found that a lot of my mental health symptoms correlate to someone who has borderline personality disorder. My recent ex (the one I divorced) was so out of my league in looks and intelligence and skills you name it but also has many traits and behaviors of someone that is narcissistic. It has damaged my self image and worth quite a bit. I’m embarrassed I let someone treat me so poorly and it makes me question whether or not I’m mentally handicapped. Very humiliating. I’m sorry for the rant (and that’s not even the half of it…) I doubt anyone will actually read this anyways. I guess I deleted social media and my next step I don’t know what it will be. Self improvement somehow I guess until I am worthy of making an online presence again. I need some serious make over… no I don’t want to look like a walking bag of plastic though. P.s. writing this was a bitch my keyboard lagged hard as hell so I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors.  \\n\\nTLDR: How do I make sure to continue to live without social media? I’m an ugly 20yr F with no sense self worth.', 'Completely isolated (TW:Mentions of abuse, death, etc) Idk, lately it\\'s just been bad. I am 18F and I need help\\n\\nI have no friends, relationship, I don\\'t talk to family for personal reasons. I work from home, no school, no socialization at all. \\n\\nIt\\'s really getting hard right now, I don\\'t want to talk to anyone, I can\\'t look at myself in the mirror, I just exist but the me I know is gone.  it\\'s like I\\'m on auto pilot, and have been for years now. Everyone kept leaving so I eventually made it a priority to leave first or to disconnect. But now it\\'s just so much worse, I woulda rather had the fake empty lies they gave me then nothing at all. \\n\\nTherapy never works for me, they just kinda diagnosed me with clinical depression, insomnia, and ADHD. I stopped going after seeing no result and just running in circles for months. It really just made my mental state really bad, and since I stopped going I think I may have developed an eating disorder (I literally just don\\'t eat cuz In my head it\\'s not worth it). \\n\\nIve tried to talk, open up, reconnect with people and reality, I\\'ve tried working on myself, in the end I\\'m just completely lost and empty. But at the same time I get super emotional out of nowhere hearing certain phrases or watching a video about a kid and their dad, my father was never really there, he just lived there and pushed me away. Never made sense to me, I look around and see all these people without time still making time for their families. My entire situation with him was just bad, he had a ton of free time and just chose to use it on one of my sister\\'s. (I\\'m the oldest of 5 biological kids.) And he only made time for the 2nd born. I had a pretty bad upbringing, alot of abuse and other stuff but I made it out.\\n\\nBeyond that, I just never \"fit in\". I was a bit of a nerdy, carefree, old-school alt kid. I never got into a serious relationship, most of my friends disconnected a few years back, only 4 stuck around, unfortunately one died in a skateboard accident out of nowhere a few weeks ago, 2 committed suicide last year, and my closest friend just moved to the opposite side of the US and we barely talk now cuz she\\'s a college student. \\n\\nI ended up getting overwhelmed and dropping out of highschool for alot of personal reasons I\\'m not ready to share. But I never stopped learning, I still study all the stuff I was previously interested in and some of it even took off like crazy, allowing me to build a living off of it. \\n\\nIm just at this place now where I can\\'t socialize, it just feels like a chore. But I can\\'t do this alone anymore either. I have no way to connect with people, and honestly I don\\'t think I\\'m mentally prepared to.  I don\\'t know what I\\'m looking for, I just know somewhere something got lost. I\\'m just tired of going through it alone. If anyone has any advice i think I need some.', \"I just wondering how am i supposed to make friends at age 22 now everything seems fucked up...  \\n\\nI knew i was different... From a young age, I always enjoyed my own company... And highly introverted... During childhood it was the happiest year of my life... To think back then I made more friends when i was a kid than an adult lol ...\\n\\nHighschool was fucking nightmare at the time i was dealing with addiction, social anxiety and major depressive episodes, everyday life i went to bed with anxious and depressed, i had suicidal thoughts each and everyday..., when i woke up depressed and anxious same cycle for years... I lost most of my friends and i was considered loser, weak, nerd, geek whatever you name it... it turned most of my childhood friends off But no one tried to bully me since i was quiet and serious also all my friends from preschool are popular people and some sort of gangshit, back then we were still in touch... I always avoid making new contacts and prefer close friends... Small circle ofc...\\n\\nTalking about studying high school I did not do well cause of mental issues... I am lacking focus, i never review or learn anything cause i was in my own head most of the time... I spend time drawing. Lol i still wondered how the fuck i passed all those class when i didn't even learn anything... Weird is i got decent grades lol\\n\\nFrom mental issues and insecurities... i was easily hurt and mentally dependent, i cut off most friends from my mental health... I was screaming for help and understanding... I could not afford therapy, so I decided to cure myself... It was 2018 when i decided to cut off my addiction and started to overcome my anxiety processing... It was one hell of a recovery journey without professional help... During withdrawal episodes, it was crippled anxiety and major depressive episodes... Due to the unbalanced brain chemical of dopamine... I fought so hard alone trying to get my life back together... I cut off people who know me, when i was at my lowest point of life... Cause i wasn't myself...\\n\\nAgain another horrific event... after a year of recovered addiction.... I lost myself once again... Cause i was too lonely, i craved people's company, and meanings in life, i saw people on social media having fun posting pictures together and tagging each other was so much fun... I thought having friends would make me happier... It was really painful memories... Even though my anxiety was still killing me but at least, i got socializing... I joined a club full of people, and they had a moto of being nice to each other... I fell into that, cause i was craving happiness... I tried to change my own personality and went against my own nature... Just to be likeable... I shut off my Te entirely and focused more on my Fe... that's how everything went downhill... People view me as a clown and look down on me etc.. i was hurt after being excluded and abandoned maybe cause i was getting too comfortable, i started to tease... Once i use my teasing and sarcastic comments to a specific person that means I like the person... Not romantically just friends... After being so hurts i realized it out... Seeking happiness from others wasn't the right choice... I started going back into my own shell and rethinking life once again..i cut off all the people i knew from the club... Cause they already viewed me as a pathetic loser already... I tried to avoid contact as much as possible... I came to realize I have problem keeping long-term friendship\\n\\nIn 2019... I took a break from people's bullshit and decided to be true to myself ... I finally came to realize all I needed was... Happiness came from within... Everything starts from the inside, i wasn't happy with myself for years how am I expecting other people to make me happy? I realized the main problem to cause this loneliness was me... I stopped blaming life or blame on god punishment... I started self doubt and hatred towards myself even more... I had a strong suicidal thoughts again... To avoid killing myself, i tried self care and building myself... I went looking for a job as a barista cause i love coffee but the job .. i didn't like it, my boss was emotionally manipulated, i was underpaid and overworked... Salary lesser than Uber driver... The only thing I loved about that job was drinking coffee for free lol... What i learned from my old job was understanding that everyone is different, you can't let them adapt to you, base on your own perspective, you must learn to accept other's flaws first... I was still being excluded from the staff's event party etc... Cause being myself is like this lol, everyone surely hates me cause i was really misunderstood...\\n\\nIn 2021 this was the peak of reaching my true self... I finally found the job I wanted... As a video editor, i was so good at it, that my boss was impressed... The first time of my life that i felt like I was doing something right... But i still hate my other boss, he is a narcissist and controlling... My anxiety relapsed cause of him... The first time I went to a therapist and was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder)... It is a hell of a living once again but at least this time I am able to control and maintain my anxiety well... I still can socialize and go to places... I was still alone anyways but i just got used to being leftout, that my emotional is numb...\\n\\n2023... Ioneliness is killing me inside... I became my own worst enemy than previous years... Everyone had friends eating lunch together at work, i was still a loner, in case of dealing with lack of trust from others and afraid of being excluded and abandoned...even though i worked there for almost 2 years now all my colleagues hate me... They are all talking fun and laughing, I'm serious alone and doing my own thing... I knew it was a punishment from god... I was doomed with loneliness and finally all the bad things happened to me... I accepted my own fate... i could not change it... Currently 22s almost end my college years while doing part time jobs at the same Time... Zero friends, life full of sadness and loneliness... My whole family also doesn't understand me and they hate me as well... My mom hopes she didn't give birth to me... My big brother is the opposite of me, he's extroverted and has a life of parties... And he looked down on me...\\n\\nI could not find happiness as I was supposed to... I still need people who are willing to accept me as friends... I'm insecurity about dating if the girl finds out I'm a loner, she is going to think I'm pathetically weak and loser that no one wants to be friends with... My social media has zero messages... Life is nothing to me but loneliness and emotional numbness... I do not know how to make friends anymore in this state... I'm about to give up on everything... Since like i find no peace within myself and even an impact on other people's life... My presence causes bad vibes, people wish i wasn't there... My life circle is to get up, go to work, go to school, go home, play online games alone... I hate my own existence... Everything is fucking boring and pathetic... What a fucking loser\\n\\n(Sorry for terrible grammar)\", \"Anyone ever just get a huge wave of loneliness Just like what the title says, i just get completely swamped by this huge wave of feeling lonely. One moment I'll be able to handle myself just fine, going about my day doing stuff and what not but then i just get smacked right in the face with just loneliness. \\n\\nIt just gets progressively worse as this feeling would often get accompanied by sadness and depression. It gets to the point where i just get random headaches from my brain trying to process so many different racing thoughts. \\n\\nThoughts on like how everyone else has somebody to talk to or simply just have a random conversation through text and what not. How other people are at the peak of their lives enjoying youth. How other people manage to maintain a best friend, heck having a group of friends. Though i do have a grp of friends i talk to but its inconsistent, since most of them are older than me and have jobs and stuff.\\n\\nIt doesnt help that i suffer from social anxiety, major depressive disorder and bipolarity. Its even ironic that I'm even typing this as often i would be too anxious to post remotely anything. It sucks so much as i would have to deal with so many intrusive thoughts like the urge just just punch a window or heck even smash my head onto my desk just in hopes to ease the mental processing that going on.\\n\\nYeah i am getting professional help but it only helps to a degree. In the end I'm just lonely and frankly pathetic. I never was able to maintain friend groups, i never ever gotten the experience a proper relationship (heck I'll be amaze if theres even a single soul who can tolerate a person like me). I got back stabbed and manipulated by people which made me lose someone who i thought was my best friend. They were the only person i ever sought solace in, they were part of my happy place and not to mention the only person i ever ran to when i slit my finger and bleeding out after punching my wardrobe.\\n\\nI hope everyone has a great day ahead, just wanted to be heard i guess. It gets overwhelming but being through all of this shit just motivates me to help others in the same position.\", 'feeling like the loneliest college student alive so i’m a girl attending college in the north east. i’m a sophomore now. freshman year was hell. I mean some good things came out of it, but overall it was just bad. I became more aware of my neediness, people pleasing tendencies, and low self esteem. I spent the whole semester falling for casual hookups and letting my grades tank in the meantime. \\n\\nanyways, this year I moved into a suite with my 3 friends. my roommate and I didn’t really know each other too well, but we both came from similar situations and we had similar interests. my suite mates are cool, but one of them has alienated me in the past and the other one just follows whatever her roommate does. \\n\\nso this weekend my friend comes to visit, is a terrible guest, blah blah blah. come sunday night, i’m alone in my room, and my roommate is in the other room laughing obnoxiously loud until 2 am. that’s when I realize she’s sleeping in there tonight. \\n\\nthey’ve officially formed an alliance, so i’m screwed. next year you have to move off campus, and I know for almost sure they’re not going to want me to live with them. on top of that, i’m currently being ghosted by a guy I had genuine feelings for. I only realize now that he’s not the person I want/made him out to be, and it hurts. \\n\\ni come from an abusive household, both parents suffering from bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. so I guess you can say I have no support from home. I came to college to save my mental health but I feel as though it’s only getting worse. \\n\\nI use the dwindling supply of benzos I have to get through the day, and adderall to complete any task. my gpa is too low to transfer at the moment. I go to therapy but that barely helps. \\n\\nI feel so fucking suicidal, but I have a brother and sister at home so I could never actually do it. I just want to be loved so badly. I feel like no matter what I do I can’t hold a friendship. I feel like i’m suffocating every time I walk into my dorm. I tried apologizing, but it got me no where. I can’t stop thinking about this guy and about how I’d feel so much better if he wanted a relationship or was just there for me in general. \\n\\nIf you got this far I really really appreciate it. I’m really losing all will I have to live. I’m hundreds of miles away from home, even though home is just as bad. I just want to sleep forever.', 'I look put-together from the outside but I feel like I have nothing? Kinda a vent. It’s hard for me to get to know people, much less become friends with them and it might be due to the discrepancy between how I look vs. how I act. I’ve dealt with social anxiety disorder my entire life which has gotten increasingly severe over time. I feel like I’m not an interesting person and have always hated myself for various reasons, a big one being that I’m not funny or charismatic. Because of my lack of control in life (over the disorder), I tried to compensate by improving my appearance. I learned how to do makeup really well, lost weight and got skinny again, cared a ton about my outfits and making sure not a hair was out of place. If you saw me in passing, you’d probably think I have no problem making friends or getting along with people because of “pretty privilege”. \\n\\nThis worked against me though because people are generally intimidated or won’t approach me (and the fact I have RBF doesn’t help). I’ve been told this many times. Students at my college with a similar “look” have tried to talk to me but get turned off immediately by my awkward responses. I don’t know how to act chill and can’t come up with smooth off-the-cuff responses like a lot of people around me. The kind of people I can make friends with and genuinely relate to don’t try to approach me and I get treated with suspicion when I try to talk to them and make a connection. It sucks because I’d totally go without makeup and never dress “nice” if I didn’t have self-esteem issues and fear of judgment. If I gave up my image, I’d have literally nothing to hold up my self-esteem. Sure, I have a good GPA and a good resume. I have a family that praises my accomplishments and appreciates me as a person. But I always feel super inferior and isolated. I have only a couple friends so I’m never in the loop for what’s going on, and I feel like I’m developmentally behind after missing out on two decades of normal socialization.\\n\\nThis is all due to the damn disorder, I’ve given up the idea of having kids in my head because I’d never want them to inherit my mental issues and go through their lives as painfully alone as I am. I’m an extrovert trapped in a brain that shuts down in front of new people and makes me feel like I’m drowning in public situations. I’ve been scathingly self-critical since childhood and I feel like that bleeds into the way I carry myself to the point others can sense it. I don’t have female friends because I’m scared of being judged by other girls, and guys only try to get to know me because of my appearance. I’ve had a few toxic relationships that further messed up my psyche, and I quickly lost my relationship with the only guy who’s everything I wanted because he saw how bitter and misanthropic I am inside. I would love to love people, but my whole life I’ve been stepped on, rejected, bullied when I made wholehearted bids for connection. At some point this year, I came to the point where I no longer felt lonely turning on my phone to zero notifications. \\n\\nRecently I’ve started an internship and also been on Omegle to practice my social skills. Onboarding with the other interns has been isolating— I see these strangers interacting and building rapport so easily. I spoke up frequently in the many meetings we had to attend, forcing myself out of my comfort zone and being super friendly and upbeat, but people treated me differently still. Somehow it’s like there’s a social contract and I’m aware of its existence but can’t seem to figure out its rules. Today we were doing some crafts with the company’s wellness committee and I turned off my webcam in the middle and stopped working on my thing because I was depressed. The activities just felt meaningless to me. I acted upbeat and was very smiley with my parents but I went up to my room after work and have just been on my phone for hours since.\\n\\nI’ve started feeling lonely again. In the past week on Omegle, I met a few other college students I really got along with. I talked for at least an hour with each of them and I really connected with this one girl in school for art and journalism. She came into the call with this enthusiastic openness and I was able to match her energy. I’m generally really friendly on Omegle to everyone I meet and finally I found someone with the same vibe. We got so comfortable talking with each other, off the bat I felt this feeling I’d been missing for a long time. It was like talking to a close friend. I was so relaxed that I was cracking jokes constantly and making her laugh— the conversation was super organic and we even made a dating profile for her after I told her some of my crazy stories. With her and the other couple of students, I was able to speak without a shred of anxiety like I hadn’t done in such a long time.\\n\\nI am grateful that I met these people. It reminded me of how it was with the two or three real friends I’ve had over the course of my life. I haven’t had that feeling of genuine happiness and human connection in years. I got their contact info but I know we won’t be in touch. They each have their own lives and actual friends, and I was able to fake being like that for the duration of our calls. I wish desperately that I was able to meet people like them near me. If I’d come across them in real life though, we probably would never have spoken. Feeling these old feelings again has caused me to slip into a depression these past couple days. Now I’m constantly checking my phone for notifications like I haven’t done in months. \\n\\nI feel lonely again. I thought I’d gotten past it for good and accepted my lot. But I can’t find much meaning in life without being able to connect with other people. I’ve lost my hobbies over time and now I don’t feel any joy or excitement towards life. There’s just apathy. I feel like I’m just dragging myself through every day. I started staying up late again even though I hate being sleep-deprived because that’s the only time I don’t have to confront reality. The feeling of being accepted was addictive. The rest of this summer is just going to be putting on a persona and faking enthusiasm in this internship when really I feel dread about my future working a 9-5 and the emptiness. I’d kill to have a purpose again. I wish God was real so at least I’d have someone to keep me company.', \"I think I've finally come to the conclusion things aren't going to get better. This is the life I created for myself and I have to live with the pain. I'm 23 (I turn 24 next month) and it's been a year since the last time I met up with a friend, even then that was the first time in a while. I'd say I've been mostly if not entirely isolated for about 2 years 3 months.\\n\\nWhen I was at school I had a bunch of friends but (to make a very long story short) as I aged I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I drew further and further into myself and would cut myself off from people who I didn't trust anymore.  Eventually I ended up with a small group of maybe 3 or 4 friends who I genuinely trusted, but it was now time to go to University and I moved as far away as I felt that I could cope with (ended up being a couple hundred miles away) I met new people and things did honestly improve then, but these new people made it harder and harder to justify putting time aside to interact with my old friends back home either online or when visiting.\\n\\nCovid hit and I had to move back home, my friendships had dwindled back home, I now only had 1 friend locally and now this distance to my new friends increased the same thing that happened to my old friends was happening again. I was losing them too.\\n\\nMe and my last friend were very vocal with our mental health situations, He'd been kicked out by his mom for being bisexual which lead to him struggling with depression and I'd had my experiences with anxiety. We'd often talk and it would help me feel better about myself. Over time though he became more and more distant with me. I was doing my best to be the best friend I could be, even when I was a student with no money I'd buy him expensive gifts for his birthday and Christmas to make him not feel alone. Eventually it got heated and we argued, I asked him if we'd met today would we still be friends? He refused to answer. He's never spoken to me since despite my best efforts.\\n\\nNow, I'm alone. It's been a year since he stopped speaking to me, my friends from uni barely contact me anymore and all I'm doing is working part time at super market and then sitting in my room for the other 3 days a week. Alone, all the time. I've tried to reach out to new people but it's become clearer and clearer that everyone else has it figured out, I'm the weird one for not having friends aged 23, I'm the weird one for never having has a relationship at 23. The worst thing is it's my fault, I can't blame anyone else, I'm such a horrible, uninteresting person that everyone wants nothing to do with me. I'm not charismatic or funny or attractive in anyway.\\n\\nMy birthday is only a few weeks away and I'm dreading it. I hate my birthday so much because it's the day that my feelings of loneliness hurt the most. It's going to be really hard, but I should try and get used to it.\", \"Hip Healz, a healing, gaming, supporting, group.

I feel let down by my parents to for not getting me help when i was younger when it was very clear i needed help.\\n\\nyesterday i was almost angry enough about everything to start punching holes in my wall.  at some points it feels like I'm loosing touch with reality and all i want are things to be better.  i don't get why i am so unlucky to have such difficulty while having a younger brother who is one of the smartest student at his $40,000 a year college.  i don't see what I'm doing wrong I always see myself as the nicest person in the world even everyone who knows me says that about me yet i still don't make friends, have never dated, never even going to a school dance.  it feels like its to late because not only is high school over, the place most people learn this kind of stuff, but I'm failing out of college to so I've probably missed my chance learning there.\", 'Maybe I could help? Hi, my names Ren, and I had this idea in my mind for a while: online therapy sessions. Now before anyone makes any assumptions, please hear me out.\\n\\nFirst of all I would like to clarify something, while I have read a lot of psychology books and have a decent amount of experience with helping people out with their emotions and problems (suicidal thoughts, depression, isolation, abusive relationships, etc.) I am NOT a qualified professional, I am NOT a therapist and I do NOT have all those years of education that therapists and psychiatrists have, not yet at least, Im still a teen.\\n\\nBut sometimes all that a person needs is someone to talk to, to vent to..and I can help with that, I want to help with that. And even if U do have some sort of mental problems or disorders, I still highly suggest that U seek out a professional or at least a trust-worthy adult, but I wont stop U from texting me if U do feel like thats what U want to do.\\n\\nLastly I want to say that my intention with this post isnt to gather more experience or practice on people, I just want to help.\\n\\nP.s: age/gender/race/sexuality/anything else does not matter, but I will not reply or message back if ur account seems shady and maybe not right away because its relativly late where I am', \"It’s been over a year and it still doesn’t feel real. About a year ago I got my heart broken, and I’ve been so lonely since. I dated this girl for about 10 months and became so invested with her, we did everything together and it was great, she even supported my dream of playing college soccer, and hopefully pro.We went to church together, the beach, dates of all kinds, we even took the ACT on the same day in the same school. I told her things, I wouldn’t even tell my therapist.I gave up everything for this girl, I gave up relationships, friendships, time, money, and a lot of effort. Most importantly and my biggest regret, I gave up every offer/scholarship I had for college for her. I decided it would be better for me to stay closer to her since I was a senior and she was a junior.  I never told her because I didn’t think twice about it, she was my everything. Well shortly after emailing the schools and coaches, She broke up with me and nothing has been the same since. She said I was “too good for her”, and that I have “too many issues” too much for her to deal with because of my past and mental disorder.\\nShe took most of  my friends away from me and the ones that are left are great and I love them,but they’ve moved on from me, they got married or moved away..Everyone has told me to move on but it’s so hard, I know it was only 10 months but I felt like it would last a lifetime, it’s hard moving on when you don’t know how to.She took everything from me, and I let her because I was in love.\\nFast forward a year later(now) she committed to play soccer and has moved on from me. I ran into her at a restaurant and she pretended she didn’t know me. I can't even begin to describe the pain in my heart. I have nothing now, no friends that care, my parents don’t care, all the people I was close with, moved away for college. \\nSo now I’m stuck in my small town with nothing to do, no one to talk to/hangout with.No texts, no snaps, no calls, nothing. Some days I don’t even want to get up and wish that I never woke up. I work, go to community college, workout, and go to church, but none of it feels the same without her or my friends. I don’t play soccer anymore, all my offers expired. I tried reaching out to a few but nothing came of it. \\nI’ve given up on everything because of one stupid heartbreak. I hate being this lonely. I don’t even cry anymore. It’s just pain in my heart. I try not to use any social media often because I get so upset and enraged that everyone got to go out and experience life, not held back by such pathetic things as heartbreak. I can’t even begin to describe the feeling when I see her stories or posts or people I used to be friends with. I just want some companionship, someone who is understanding, someone who won’t judge me. I want a second chance at life.\", 'how i feel. **TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide, PTSD,** \\n\\ni am a male who turned 17 a few months ago. i suffer from Bipolar disorder, Social Anxiety, and ADHD. i have experienced trauma from a few years ago that i feel like i will never truly recover from or find real closure. and more obstacles like losing friends or something i love will come my way regardless of what i do about it.\\n\\nsome would say i should talk about my problems but every time i open up about them people either wont listen or wont hear what im saying as i naturally have a very quiet voice. if you want an example, last year my mom passed away in her sleep and i tried to continuously bring up how she died but either no one would hear me or i would find myself cut off for something thats more \"important\". now this of many thoughts has been nailed into my mind to the point i am genuinely afraid to stick up for myself and find professional help due to the fear of being judged for thinking these things. no one ever tells me its okay to think these things so at the end of the day is it worth even writing this dump if someone is going to tell me that this is an unhealthy mindset?\\n\\ni am failing a handful of all my classes because of all these thoughts in my head telling me i will never omit to anything in the real world and wont live passed the age of 20. the only friends i have left in school never ask if i am okay or ever want to talk to me. whenever im pulled out of a classroom or reminded im falling behind on my assignments. they\\'ll either write me up without asking me whats going on or when i tell them its mental health they never ask me more about it. but who am i kidding no one will ever understand.\\n\\nconsidering i dont see myself contributing to anything in friend groups or even passing i often think about dropping out of high school. if i dont have a good plan for the real world or see myself living passed 20 whats the point? no one ever thinks of me as a genuine friend and i feel like a ghost half the time not knowing what to talk about.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nif you want a good idea of what i havent recovered from, well in 2021 i was dating a girl who convinced me it was okay to think these thoughts and checked up on how much water i was drinking or how much food i was eating. our relationship abruptly ended because someone insulted her while she was facing her own problems. when i first had to accept this i had genuine thoughts of ending it all because she was the only friend i had who ever cared about me.\\n\\nfor a while, i actually felt better about myself and didnt have these thoughts as much because i had a theatre class in the 10th grade with people who got me out of my shell and convinced me to express myself. there was a girl in that class i had feelings for and we became good friends around the end of the year. i was beginning to build up the courage to ask her out until i overheard she was moving to a private school for charity and other things. on the last day of school me and her were both waiting for a parent to pick us up from school. so for maybe 20 or 30 minutes we just talked about random things. i asked her if she was actually moving and she said yes but brought up that she\\'d come back in the 12th grade. after learning she was gone i began to feel kind of depressed again, but i kept reminding myself she\\'d come back so i wouldnt feel as sad. eventually school started back in august and i didnt have theatre class anymore. i have an animation class now but the only friends i really talked to take different classes so i stopped talking to pretty much everyone altogether as i mentally felt lost. especially since i cant trust anyone.\\n\\nhowever me and that girl talked on snapchat occasionally and we\\'d talk about how our days been. i asked her if she was coming back when she brought up how overwhelming school is and she said that plan might change. considering nothing ever seems to go right she probably is not coming back it just makes me feel much more miserable. \\n\\nthe only happiness i even feel is either making music on a computer or sleeping in on a school day. i have a designated friend group on the internet that often times is chaotic but for the intentions of usually being a joke. this is one of the things restricting me from committing suicide as i feel like without me in that friend group there would be much more arguments and more people would split into their own groups. additionally i\\'ve known these friends for years so without them i cant imagine how they\\'d react if they heard news of me ending it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nanyways sorry if this a mess btw. not great at writing long posts like this. especially if im writing about things in the back of my mind :P', \"why am I alone in my head? I was recently given the idea that I may have trauma from my childhood. I always think people are making fun of my. I do have night terrors and sometimes scream in my sleep. I always try avoiding people because I am afraid of what they'll say to me. I am always on edge around others and intimidated by them as well.\\n\\nMore about me that could relate to my ptsd. I laugh at other people's reaction when I insult them. Not in a way to be mean but in a way to just feel comfortable and feel like I can be on their level. I believe this has something to do with the fact that I still experience people laughing at me when I was a child and how funny they viewed my reaction which in turn has me develop that kind of humor.\\n\\nI believe I have an underdeveloped mind. I still watch cartoons to this day. I have never dated anyone. I am really not into porn. I am not asexual because I still find female attractive. All that points me in a direction that I may have an underdeveloped mind.\\n\\nOther things I do that relate to my trauma is depression. I feel very isolated and alone from everyone else in society. I have terrible facial expression along with awkward positioning when I walk. When I was younger I wasn't always like that. I was a very cheery lad as a kid until my ocd and adhd started to get in the way of my social life\\n\\nI feel really intimidated when I see other people talk to me. I am scared of what they may say to me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. When someone does insult me I react in a very scared way that makes it fun for them to insult me. They see how easy it is to insult me and they continually make fun of me getting in my head. It is hard for me to say anything back to them because I have a very bad time communicating my thoughts. \\n\\nI cling onto friends real easily. Everytime I lose a close relation with friends I tend to feel even more isolated then I already do. In the end I really care what they think of me. In this internship I tend to always go out of my way to help my superiors so they can accept me.\\n\\n I always had the idea that I am a super hero that can defeat anyone. This image of myself being one started in 6th grade and it continues to this day. I'd imagine myself being like that when I listen to music. This kind of imagine gives me the belief that I am superior to everyone else but when reality is being faced in front of me all, that feeling goes quickly away.\\n\\nFor the first time ever I meant somebody else who had adhd and ocd but didn't show any kind of issues expressing themselves through their face. They could speak perfectly fine and I could see they were very confident in their words. They do enjoy being around others and don't have any issue with conversation. This has led me to a conclusion that I have something other then ad/ocd and I believe it might be ptsd.\\n\\nMore information that might help answerthis question! \\n\\nI am currently working at a company  and I majoring in management information systems or business analyst I have 2 siblings with my brother becoming a freshman in college and my sister is going into the 8th grade. Both my parents are very loving and caring. My mother is a business owner and my dad is not working because of his heart which he is currently on disabilities for. \\n\\nI have seen therapist in the past, I stopped because I thought that I didn't need it after I graduated from high school. Once I did hit half way through my freshman year I wanted to see a counselor on campus which she did help in some capacity but I eventually did stop seeing her. I started seeing another counselor on campus two weeks ago but I wanted more help so I wanted to try betterhelp and give it a try. I learned that my mindset is not set in stone as in I can change who I am. Before I started seeing my counselor. I believed that my adhd and ocd were things that I could not change. She has taught me that I can change who I am. She introduced mindfulness and mediation which got me to believe that I can improve or in other words get better with dealing with my adhd/ocd. I stopped doing both of those because they were not in my interest but I still am trying to figure out other ways to improve myself. \\nWhile I was doing this internship I believed I was not going to perform well because of my disorders. As time has went on however, I started to realized that the main issue was not my disorders but my self esteem.\\nMy motivation has been through my work ethic. When I was younger was made fun of a lot by my peers from being different from them as in not being as good enough to enjoy a conversation with them. In middle school I specifically remember that every 2-3 months I would no longer be welcomed by others I sat with who I thought were my friends. In high school it got better but I started feeling lonely and still do. In high school I vouched to myself that I would prove them wrong by getting a good job so people could look up to me which has made my life good and bad in some ways. The good thing is it has got me to work really hard in college and I enjoy doing work because I feel part of something. The bad being that this kind of mindset has got me to think that people are always out to get me.\\n\\nI take medication which is 125 mg of stetraline which my docter wants me to start taking 200 mg soon, 40mg of atomoxetine, 25mg of adderall, and trazodone.\\n\\nOne thing I  often do is getting sidetracked easily. When I am giving a task it is easy for me to get distracted and do something else which becomes an obsessive thought from my ocd and my adhd. I will then make the obsessive thought a thing I will hyberfocus onto which in turn makes me be in the clouds a lot.\\n\\n Another issue I tend to do commonly is I commonly have a hard time paying attention in certain situations which in turn makes it hard for me to pay attention when someone is giving me instructions.\\n\\nConclusion!\\n\\nDo I have complex ptsd? What other kind of disorders/mental health issues could I possibly have. I am seeing a therapist within less then a month but the more information I get from people the better I get. Thank you for reading down this far and I look forward to reading any comments you post.\\nEdit I don't have autism. I got tested for that already.\", 'I just need to share my experience with loneliness and my depression. I’ve been in the mental hospital 3 times in the little over a year for severe anxiety and depression. I’m not sure why, but in 2021 I ended up going inpatient for anxiety that wouldn’t end and my life hasn’t been the same since. My 3rd trip in the hospital I would wake up not even caring about being lonely, but just hating existing so much I would just think only suicidal thoughts, but I knew I couldn’t do that to myself or my family. But it really was hell. I was even looking into ECT where they induce a seizure into your brain to help depression which can have big side effects. In these times, the only that could sort of help was talking to people - other patients or staff.\\n\\nBy a stroke of luck I met a girl during this time inpatient and my medication seemed to be helping at least some. We had common interests in board/card games and started dating when we both got out of the hospital. For the first time in a long time I experienced what it felt like to be physically close to someone, cuddle, kiss, etc. She very quickly was saying things about a long term relationship which I should have known was a red flag, but in my position where I was in hell for so long I didn’t really care. But soon, she realized she didn’t wanna be committed, and in fact didn’t want to be in a relationship at all, and this switch was so fast and jarring it hurt me a lot. One of her disorders is BPD, and I guess these people can be prone to relationship difficulties just like this. We tried to stay friends, but even that was too difficult for me, and I kept getting hurt, and she called me emotionally too sensitive for catching feelings when she still wanted to do things like hold hands/cuddle but not get attached... I wanted to try but it wasn’t possible for me, Everyone in my life told me this person was manipulative and gaslighting and not good for me and after a few more times of trying to make it work I realized it couldn’t and cut off all communication. This was devastating to me of course but I knew it had to be done because everyone including me saw a toxic pattern. \\n\\nBut this was someone I could hold, who wanted to play cuphead with me, someone I could watch a movie with and a girl who liked me. I didn’t realize how motivating all of that could be and help me through even the most severe of my bouts of depression. And it all happened and vanished so quickly.\\n\\nIt just meant so much to me that someone cared enough to want to message me everyday, who wanted my presence and just liked me for who I was. And now I look back and it just seems like her side of the interest was just part of her disorder or whatever, and I got mistreated and always was made to feel like everything was my fault. So it all feels false in a way, and I had to block her on everything and she’s out of my life\\n\\nAll in all, I guess it’s good I had the experience, because how much it hurt me made me realize how lonely I have been and how I’ve been running away from that because of fear of rejection I’ve just withdrawn for many years and focused on other things, but all the while I think I’ve been desperately seeking validation - especially romantically and feel like I have failed so dramatically. I just feel like a pathetic person, trying to get the attention of others but feeling unworthy, or incapable of absorbing it somehow.\\n\\nI don’t know why but I feel alone even around my friends and family. I feel like I can’t speak my mind. I don’t find myself interesting so why would someone else? And to have a connection with someone also dealing with mental struggles, be made to feel like they were very invested, and saying unprompted things like “I’m not going anywhere” etc, only for them to not want that anymore and have to cut them out is so painful. \\n\\nAnd now I just feel like nothing… I don’t know how to meet someone that can make me feel like that again. I think the painful truth is I have to work on myself first before I can try a relationship again. I am lucky that I have friends but I feel like I can’t speak what I’m really thinking, I even feel alone with them most of the time. I don’t want to die without a healthy relationship. There have been times where my depression has been bad enough I really think there is a risk I could die before that happens by my own hand, but that also serves as motivation for me. But it’s such a lonely road to walk, when my depression already makes me feel disconnected. I am just hoping I have another stroke of luck and taking care of myself the best I can. I have been doing daily exercise and sticking to a schedule, etc. and I do think I’m doing a bit better but I just feel so empty compared to when I was with that girl, even if it was not the right one, and it’s made me feel like I’ve wasted so much time. And I didn’t even meet her of my own will, it was just lucky we were both in the same place at the same time, more or less forced to interact. I have no idea how I could create this scenario in the real world, with anxiety, self doubt and more freedom. How do you even meet people? I find myself annoyed by everyone, including myself, but I am so alone. Why am I like this? How can I change this?\\n\\nI’ll never forget one night with her I randomly just felt horrible, and I was just crying for no reason, and she told me “I’ve never known someone so depressed they don’t even know why they’re sad, but I’ll be here for you when you’re like that” and it meant so much to me and by the end of the night my mood had turned around. And how it all turned out makes me realize how empty those words were, and how little I meant to her.\\n\\nBut it also makes me realize I think loneliness is a core part of this depression. I so desperately want to reach out to those around me and connect, but it’s like I hate everyone and myself too much at the same time. I so desperately want a romantic connection, but I am so insecure and feel I have nothing to offer. I feel like a shell of a person who will be stuck like this because I’m too empty for anyone to bother filling up.', \"I dont know, my vent or something I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this, maybe someone out there has felt the same or something. Im also sorry if this is long, as I can sometimes be long winded. Ive realised today that socially Ive kinda lost all the progress I had thought I had made. I have never found socialising easy. I am neurodivergent (Dx ADHD and suspected autism) and also have a host of other mental health issues, including a relatively rarer and much less known disorder. On top of all of this I am trans and have a gender non conforming appearance. All of this has gone together I think to often present a person who people i think either dont know how to deal with or dont want to be around.\\n\\nOver the years I have never exactly been people's choice of friend. Sure I mean I have had friends, often made through circumstance when I was a kid. But as time went on it became more and more obvious who was actually the one engaging the friendships. This only got worse when I transitioned and I lost pretty much every friend I had.\\n\\nAfter a car accident that exacerbated everything, and ended up creating a very turbulent period, I no longer could work and found it very difficult to study. On top of this I spent pretty much all of my time staring at the same 4 walls, with not much to do. Eventually, after >!a suicide attempt,!< I got some agency support and some friends who while not there most of the time, if its crisis time they are usually there. With this I was able to start going to a few group things.\\n\\nWhat started as 1 then 2 group things, quickly ended up with me playing 11 tabletop roleplaying sessions a week, going to a music group, occasionally going to a pop punk club night, and possibly more I dont remember. Basically anything that aligned with my interests to stave off the loneliness I had felt.\\n\\nEventually I would end up meeting the girl who would become my partner. When we started dating I was still doing most of the groups and everything. A few times I did have to stop something because it clashed with something I wanted to do with my partner. She also helped me see that some of the groups I was in were not actually healthy for me, the people in the group being toxic, and that the only reason I stuck with them was because of that loneliness. Never once did she say I needed to stop anything, so yeah I know some people might interpret it as a manipulation but no.\\n\\nAs time went on, I was still with my partner and we were now living together, was still in a couple of the groups, and honestly I thought I had honestly turned everything around. Then the shop run by some friends where one of the groups I played at ran into a lot of issues with my friends leaving their business partner to clean up his messes. Now I had been friends with these people since before they ran the shop. I had join an RPG group that in a way spawned the shop. However once they left the shop I have not once seen them or talked to them without being the one to initiate contact. This is actually a theme. That I am usually the one who has to contact my friends, because if I dont I would literally never hear from them. This can actually be very hard for me because unless I am reminded of them in some way I can loose track of their existence (thanks ADHD), so if someone hasn't sent me a message in a few months there is a very good likelihood that I will never text them again.\\n\\nHowever while all this has been going down, including having a friend end up ditching me and my partner causing my partner a good deal of mental stress, I hadn't been feeling the effects of the loneliness so much because my partner was always close by. However recently both mine and my partner's mental health were in a precarious position with both of us having hospital visits (she was in an very low maintenance ward off hospital campus, while I only was in short stay for 2 nights). Part of the reason for my hospital visit was that something my partner had said because of her stuff, ended up triggering me and yeah, Through this we realised just how fragile both of our situations currently were, and so for the moment she has been staying with her mother (as she has a greater SH risk, and it can be a trigger to me) while I stay in our house by myself. It isn't us taking a break from the relationship as we still talk and we do see each other sometimes.\\n\\nThings have been kinda up and down over the past few weeks since we started this situation. All of them culminating in today. A friend sent me a message asking if I had gone to an annual LGBT festival event, as they had and were wondering if I was there. I told them I wasn't there as I hadn't been aware  it was today (because I have barely left the house the last few weeks I barely know what is going on around me) and even if I had known I didn't have anyone to go with.\\n\\nIt was that last statement that really stuck with me. That I really dont have anyone. Ive tried organising things with people, tried reaching out to people. Over the last few weeks I have tried so much to put in place a social circle but at the end of the day I have nothing to show for it. And so Im back to square 1, staring at the same 4 walls day in day out. \\n\\nIf you read through all of this, Im sorry.\", \"18F. Terrified of my next birthday. What on Earth should I do. My last birthday was SO incredibly lonely. I had a mental breakdown which triggered one of my Bipolar episodes after months in an abusive relationship ft alcoholism, rampant drug use etc. \\n\\nI turned 18. My only friends were people I used with and my family had me back home 25 miles away from them all. I did ask them to come to a quiet birthday lunch at my Grandmothers, but naturally as they learnt it would be a family party with no alcohol or drugs, they nicely declined. And one of them was a 'friend' I'd had since I was 11, so that was 7 years. \\n\\nI was fragile, upset and too depressed to even make an effort. I kinda sat there feeling so empty, only my grandparents, mother and stepfather were there. Ended up sinking a couple of beers just to get through it without breaking down in tears. I'm an incredibly small person. Doesn't take much to get me drunk when I've gotten sober. \\n\\nSince then, I've moved away, cut and dyed my hair, lost a lot of weight (I have an eating disorder and contamination based OCD with has now become disabling), literally changed my name, closed my personal Facebook (which had 30 friends. Most of which were primary school friends from eight years ago), changed my number etc. Nobody knows where the fuck I am, what I look like or what I'm doing. \\n\\nI start an access course in September at a technical college near where I now live. I'm hoping I'll make some friends. But my 19th birthday is May. I'm so fucking scared. I have NOBODY. I don't want it to be like last time. I'm so broken worrying about it. I almost want to cancel my birthday....it's just another day. \", 'I\\'m all alone and I need someone to talk to  \\n\\nFirst off if you have anything to say at all please don\\'t hesitate to make a comment I\\'d love to hear other people\\'s responses. I feel like I am truly alone and this isn\\'t a recent feeling with the pandemic I\\'ve felt this way for years. I just feel different from everyone. There are three main aspects of my life that make me feel this way.\\n\\nThe first aspect is my friendships. I\\'ve never been friendless but I\\'ve never had more than 5 or so friends at any given time. Right now I only have 3 real friends that I actually see on a somewhat regular basis. I was apart of a different friend group but I realized I was the least valued member in that group. So I did a little experiment since I noticed it was always me hitting them up and trying to get invited to their gatherings I texting them to see if they would text me first. They didn\\'t and that was all the proof I needed so I just dropped them. Anyway that\\'s happened a lot where I\\'m the least valued member of a friend group.\\n\\nThe second aspect is my family. Next thing is my family. I moved to Southern California when I was three and have been living here ever since. I\\'m 20 right now for reference. Anyway I was originally born in Northern California and that\\'s where all my family lives besides my parents. While I am close to my cousins that do live up there I only see them one or maybe twice a year if I\\'m lucky. Also it is important to note that I don\\'t have any siblings, I\\'m an only child. Other than my parents I have no family that lives around me so growing up it was never like \"let\\'s go to grandma\\'s house.\" When it comes to my parents they were never mean or abusive. I can count the amount of times they beat me on one hand. But they never really went out pf their way to try and make sure I was ok. Whenever I try to talk to my parents about my feelings it never goes well. My mother immigrated from the Middle East so I am half Arab. In Middle Eastern culture people with mental disorders are seen as trash and they are never offered real help. Just one of the many reasons why I hate my culture but that\\'s a whole different rant. So it never goes well when I talk to her as for my dad he just doesn\\'t really understand either. He\\'s better than my mom as he at least tries to help but often what he says hurts more than helps as he says things like \"get over yourself\" and \"quit complaining your not crippled and don\\'t have cancer.\" Comments like these don\\'t help because he doesn\\'t know what it\\'s like for me and he doesn\\'t try to step into my shoes.\\n\\nThe third aspect is the lack of romantic relationships in my life. I\\'m just gonna say it I\\'m 20 years old and I haven\\'t had a girlfriend a single day in my life. The farthest I\\'ve gone is making out with a girl in 2016 at a party only because of a dare. She didn\\'t even want to make out with me, she liked someone else at the time. I\\'ve never even held a girl\\'s hand. I don\\'t have problems making friends with girls in fact 2 out of the 3 friends I mentioned earlier are girls but I just don\\'t know what\\'s wrong. I\\'ve never had a girl come up to me to start a conversation, I\\'ve never had a girl compliment me, and there has never been a girl to show even any remote signs of interest in me. I\\'m not the best looking guy in the world but I\\'m not fat, I shower and clean myself, and I go for hikes almost every day to keep in shape. It just makes me think \"what\\'s wrong with me\" and \"I\\'m not good enough and I\\'m worthless in the eyes of girls.\" It just pains me to see other people whether they be my friends, family, or random people in relationships while I\\'m starving for attention. I just want that kind of connection with someone. I just want someone to come home to and listen to how my day was. I want someone who I could share anything with. I just want to experience what it\\'s like to have that kind of deep connection with another. I\\'m still only 20 so I know I\\'m young but with how my mental state is now it\\'s only going to get worse in the coming years if I can\\'t find a girl. I predict if things don\\'t change I\\'m probably going to hit my breaking point around age 25. At that point I really fear that I will do something brash and seriously hurt myself or others. In other words I am scared of myself cause there is only so much loneliness the human mind can take before it reaches a point of true insanity. Humans are social creatures after all nobody is truly independent we need each other.\\n\\nHowever there is light at the end of the tunnel. I am transferring out of my community college and moving into a real university this fall. I did get accepted to my local university but I chose to go one that is about a 4 hour drive away from where I live now. Mainly because I feel like I have nothing left for me in this city and I want to view this as a fresh start. Once I go there I will forget everything that\\'s happened in the past and only try to focus on the future. I hope I\\'m able to find some new people because if I don\\'t and I stay alone then I don\\'t know how long I\\'d be able to live like this.\\n\\nThank you to whoever read the whole thing and even more thanks if you left a comment.\\n\\nTL:DR - I have felt lonely my entire life this boils down to three aspects of my life. The first is lack of friends. I only have three real friends right now and have never had more than around 5. Second is family. I don\\'t have any siblings and other than my parents no family lives in my city. It has been this way my whole life. Third is lack of romantic relationships, I\\'ve never had a girlfriend and that brings me deep sadness and loneliness. I just want to experience that kind of connection you get when your in a relationship with another person.', \"I dont feel accepted because of my autism. The world just feels really hostile to me  \\n\\nThroughout most of my life I’ve only been comfortable talking and being around my mom, dad, sister and therapist that I see. I only had one friend early on in my life from kindergarten (2005) to about 6th grade (2011) when we drifted off. From then on to today i've been alone because i'm very anxious/nervous around people and do not feel accepted or comfortable around people due to my mental disorder.(ill get to that soon)\\n\\nI was a very quiet person when I was younger. My parents and teachers were concerned with me since I never talked in school. I would only talk in front of my parents, sister and friend. I wouldn’t even talk in front of other family members such as my cousins, aunt and grandparents. For some reason letting other people hear my voice felt very scary. I did not understand I had a problem. I was happy with my only friend and viewed not talking as normal.Obviously it was not normal and something was going on. Looking back on it now I was very scared, uncomfortable and anxious around people/strangers but it became normal and felt normal to me when I was very young. \\n\\nIn elementary school I wouldn’t talk and did not like talking in front of students. When I say that I mean I would not say a word at school. I was known by students for being quiet and not talking. I was mute for everyone everyday until the last year or so of elementary when I got more comfortable responding to questions my teachers had. By middle school I was able to respond to people when asked something but I would still not voluntarily say anything or talk to people. I was still very uncomfortable and anxious. People had always known me as the person who did not talk. My friend even joked that if i did not start talking they would put me in the special ed class.\\n\\nMy friend and I sort of drifted off in 6th grade and the next school year something between us happened and we just forgot about each other. I was already alone most of the time growing up but from that point onward I would move into the situation that I am still in today. In 8th grade I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by a psychologist from the county. More specifically the Aspergers type. The diagnosis explained a lot to my teachers and parents. The next year I started a program for kids with mental disorders at a high school a bit further away then the school I would’ve gone to if I wasn’t put in the program. It wasn’t any different from what they taught in normal classes. It was basically smaller class sizes. I felt more comfortable in these classes but we did have to take electives with the mainstream students. At first nothing much changed in high school from middle school. Still just as uncomfortable and anxious around people as before but during the last 2 years or so I started to really want to have people to talk to and do stuff with, like friends. I think I’ve always wanted friends even in middle school but I just never acknowledged it upfront or paid attention to it. \\n\\nIts now been 2 years since i graduated in may of 2018 and nothing has changed, even with my new therapist i started seeing in the spring of 2018. All these years we've been talking about the same thing. Ive been stuck for so long. There has been other things weve talked about and things that were previously uncomfortable for me to share and tell him. For the most part though weve made no progress with the main issue of making social connections. \\n\\nIve just always been terrified of people. I only feel safe speaking and acting out around my immediate family. In fact I’ve always had this view or feeling of the world where my mom, dad, sister and me are one unit and then everyone else i encounter in my life or have yet encountered or just exist in the world feel like strangers or foreigners to me. Like I’m comfortable in the house my mom, sister and me live in but when I venture out into the world with them it’s like I’m stepping out to outer space or to a foreign country. All my interactions with people are so uncomfortable. I’m scared to approach them or speak to them. When I am out in the world and I do have to talk my heart beat goes up, I start sweating and I start panicking internally like it’s the end of the world. When I talk my voice is very low and it sounds very different from when I talk to my mom, dad or sister. It has this very mundane neutral tone. Sometimes I even try to change the way it sounds around strangers to something that sounds like what I use with my parents and sister but it never works. It just stays the same. It’s really frustrating cause I come off as more innocent or disabled when I sound like that. A lot of times I don’t know what to say or reply when people who aren’t my parents talk to me. No matter how much I try to act myself, my personality completely changes when I’m around other people. It’s like my brain reverts to a really primitive state where my voice has no emotion, I’m really scared, quiet and want to leave. I just can't express myself. \\n\\nIn situations where I have talked to people it’s never gone well. Like one time I was talking to a volunteer staff person at a wolf sanctuary in PA my dad and I visit often. He was actually the one who started talking to her asking questions about the wolves there but I had been wanting to test out my speaking skills all day so I chimed in and asked about the coyotes in the area. I stuttered and stumbled over my words when I spoke. I tried to control my voice but didn’t know how, all my brain was doing was putting another word in front of the other while retrieving thoughts. This always happens, my brain just detonates and malfunctions when talking to someone I don’t know. The most humiliating part about that experience in particular is how the volunteer staff person responded to me. She treated me differently than when she responded to my dad. Her voice had changed to a soft spoken one and her answer to my question was noticeably simpler. This happens a lot actually...\\n\\nLike when I interact with people whether it be in a class, internship or i'm just ordering food at subway people treat me and talk to me like i'm a little kid in a baby voice. I hate it. I just want to be treated and talked to the way they would talk to another person who is 20. People have always treated me this way as if im more innocent or dont know the things I would at my age. It makes me feel even more alienated and left out of the social environment for young adults. I've completed high school and am in a community college. I have the same goals for success and wants as anyone my age would have. I don't know exactly what it is. Is it my timidness? Voice? My aversion to eye contact? Maybe it's my 5,4 height that makes people think I'm way younger than I am. I guess it could be a combo of all.\\n\\nTo sum everything up I just don't feel accepted based on the experiences I've had. I'm also very very afraid of people to the point where it's as if its a natural instinct. Its always been that way and the severity of it has gotten worse over time. I feel like those two things have caused me to miss out on a lot of things/interests. Theres  been this interest ive had but never really felt connected to the community for it. I've always just been this spectator for almost a decade around it. It actually took me like 10 therapy sessions of alluding to it to my therapist to actually tell him. This interest is furries. Okay this part goes a bit off topic but i just wanted to explain why to clear up a bit things since this fandom is infamous for being controversial. \\n\\nMy affinity for animal characters goes way back to when I was much younger. In fact I was into a specific type of anthropomorphic character that would be known today as a feral. This all started when I was very young, around 4 or 5. I had a big interest for cats and dogs. Particularly seeing them in movies. I liked watching movies like all dogs go to heaven and the 2 homeward bound movies from the 90s. I developed an affinity for canine characters in particular to where I became obsessed with them. Characters being dogs just felt more natural and aesthetically attractive. In fact when I was around 7 or 8 I started to come up with these stories in my head that would have dogs as characters. I’d imagine what happens in one episode/storyline and I would play it in my head as I came up with stuff while in bed at night. I’d imagine all of it in 2d animation. This is one of those weird things I did people may find off putting about me. Anyways i started doing this in 2008 when I was about 8 and it continued consistently until about 2012. I sort of forgot about it then as I had different interests coming in. Later in 2012 I found the Anthro/Fursuit part of the furry community. I've watched from the sidelines since.\\n\\nAnyways i feel like i've missed a lot of things. My fear of people kept me from doing anything. \\n\\nNow I’m 20 and I don’t know how people act at this age or do for fun. That thought alone causes me anxiety, stress and sadness. I’ve grown up and everything but despite graduating, going to a community college and looking for jobs I still feel 7 years younger. I only have experience talking to my parents and the last time I talked regularly with someone my own age was in mid 2011. I never had someone my own age as a friend in the past 9 years to talk to. On top of this I don’t know what people my age casually do for fun. The things I do see people do scare me. Even the way I hear people talk intimidates me. It's just all shouting, unrestrained and rambunctious. Meanwhile I'm quiet and when I do talk or laugh it's a low voice and my personality is generally the opposite of the way I described the people i'm afraid of. Whenever I'm approached by one one these people and respond, they're thrown off by my calm and mundane response. I'm even afraid of how big or tall people my age are. The last time i had a friend most people were around my height and i kinda stopped growing at 5’4 and now that i'm 20 it's so jarring to see all these people who are almost 6’0. Like i can't believe I'm in the same age group as them.\\n\\nI know I’m 20 and I still got a lot of time. But for the longest time I’ve been stuck where I am socially for years and have not gotten less afraid or improved mentally a bit in that time span.  More recently I’ve been stuck the past year or so talking about the same things with my therapist. This January I just gave up but I still don’t want it to be that way. I’ve seen posts from other people on reddit who are in their 40s and still haven’t made any friends. I’m stuck right now and I could very well end up like that. \\n\\nI have seen people recommend using discord or twitter to meet new people but I have just as a hard time connecting to people on there as I do in real life. A lot of times I don’t know what to say like irl. And like i want to say more then just a few words to show people that I’m interested and care about what they’re saying but all that comes out of me is “ok, nice, yes, oh cool, oh”. It’s frustrating. I mean I’ll say almost the same thing irl audibly of course but I feel irl I can be a bit more flexible despite my limited vocabulary when approached by strangers. Typing messages online limits so much emotion for all people and misunderstandings can occur as a result. Last year in June I ran into this problem. Long story short, it ended with people bullying me on discord and a Minecraft server. I actually cried irl when trying to tell a discord admin what happened. From then on I decided that if I were ever to pursue a friendship or connection it’d be in person not online. \\n\\nRecently i've sort of reversed my decision but have run into the same problems as before. My therapist actually encouraged me to find a group related to my furry interest but I was already in one anyway and have been encountering the same problems. Such as being very atypical and awkward to the point of people treating me different, getting very confused, ignoring me and even getting mad at me. I try to be myself but im just so incompatible with the way most people talk and think and interpret things, process things. I take things literally, don't understand sarcasm, humor and social cues. A lot of times i just talk so formal and i hate it but its the only way i know how to talk, Formal as if i was at an interview. Worse part in the whole discord idea was being bullied off a server when people knew something was up with me. Saying i reeked of autism. I just cant take it. I try to join conversations but am usually met with some level of aggression and when I try to start them im ignored or they just end very quickly. It took months for me to actually talk in new groups and try to get past anxiety. Almost every time things take a turn for the worst and i'm left scarred from those experiences and even more afraid to speak.\\n\\nI don't know why but last December i thought something would happen. Maybe where I finally get more involved in the furry community. The month just went on and passed though. Then January, February and spring. We're now two thirds through June.\\n\\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I'm exhausted, sad and have just lost all hope for connecting to people and living a normal life for someone my age. Like i mentioned before I have been trying to get more involved in the furry community but haven't had too much luck as you can see. Though on top of that the community has always terrified me a bit. The whole furry thing has grown exponentially the last few years and it seems like a huge social jungle when I see furry social media, pages, groups, pics of cons etc.\\n\\nAnyways the way my ASD affects the way I think and act combined with my severe social anxiety just gets in the way of everything in my life. My interactions with people end up weird and even creepy and end up with people trying to get away from me or treating/speaking to me like I’m a little kid and not a 20 year old adult. That last thing is so confusing for me and another huge issue in itself. I’m just too different in the way I think and act as an anti social repellent. This world just isn’t really for me. I was born with ASD and grew up terribly afraid of people, feeling inferior and different. I’ve felt alienated from society based on the experiences I’ve had. Now I just have no hope. For me, meeting people, connecting and talking would be as likely as winning a billion dollars. It just feels impossible at this point. I’m incapable of forming relationships with other people besides my parents. I’ve always been that way. All I want is someone to talk to, maybe help me with my creative work and share ideas. I'm just too incompatible though. I just feel so trapped by my circumstances and that I may never break through to the world.\\n\\nRecently I confessed to my therapist that I wanted to jump off an overpass onto a 12 lane interstate near me. Everything i've tried has not worked. All the online stuff i was suggested by my therapist and job coaches has not worked. I wanted to be happy but the human society/culture has rejected me. The world is so hostile, more then i thought. No one takes the time to understand you or realize you have feelings and are capable of being hurt badly. The only social contact I've had the past decade has been my parents and sister. It hurts so bad that I've had enough. Looking ahead to the 2020s my life will just be filled sadness, depression, loneliness, existential crises and will just be a generally painful experience mentally. \\n\\nI'm looking through a journal I wrote near the end of march. Ive gotten worse since. Every year it's the same thing since I graduated in may 2018. I'm alone in this universe. All I wanted was a friend I could talk to. I like drawing feral dogs and wolves. Making stories for them. That's it. Most of my posts on reddit go unnoticed and when someone does respond through dms… they go away eventually… and i'm alone again, in the void of the universe.\\n\\nI dont know what im even going to do after this post. I dont want to be lonely but thats probably what awaits me. :(\", \"My work and social life are great, I'm more confident but I'm also insanely lonely. Didn't even know this sub existed, didn't really know there would ever be a need for me to post and confess my loneliness to Internet people, but here goes.\\n\\nMy story at the moment is basically that I went from a lonely and very stressful living situation (tiny studio apartment inner-city right next to train tracks) to a cheaper and much more relaxed environment (living with a couple of cool older guys out in the 'burbs). I have come into my own after a long few years of struggling as a student, and am now helping manage a disability organisation. My workplace environment is great, my confidence with people in general has never been better, I've got friends from school living up here as well as a lot of friends I've made on the way. I virtually never have a weekend where I'm not alone.\\n\\nAnd yet, whenever I'm left to my own devices, such as commuting to/from work, in bed trying to sleep (huge insomniac), I just get absolutely crushed by loneliness. I've always been an introvert at heart but have become more extroverted. But it just seems like I can't fill that void. I think there's two major factors which bring my loneliness into the fore:\\n\\n1. Mental Health: I am currently seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist for treatment for what may be bipolar disorder. The weight of this is really making me feel stigmatised and abnormal, although it makes a lot of my life make sense too. I'm on mood stabilisers after being a bit too hyper (manic) and it's swinging me the other way now. So yeah, the ever-present loneliness is symptomatic of some depression I'd say.\\n\\n2. Relationships: It's been too long since I've been in a relationship/FWB/one-night stand situation, even though I basically don't ever do the latter. I think this is the big one. I'm really wary of using a relationship as a means of patching a hole and little else, but the longer I am alone in this context the more self-defeating beliefs crop up about my potential as a partner or hell, even a hookup. Being in my mid-twenties and seeing half my friends engaged/in long-term relationships or being 'players'doesn't help my own confidence either.\\n\\nI've ranted and rambled in a sub I never thought I'd come across, but I guess this is just catharsis for me if nothing else. Not after advice per se, I'd just like to share that sometimes we don't need to be specifically socially isolated to feel alone. Sometimes there are some needs fulfilled but not all. Intimacy is a big one for me atm.\", 'sad :( Hi! I’ve been as isolated as one can be, the last few months. And haven’t had an appetite or even got enjoyment from music (!! 😢) or anything.. And so on. I think being so used to loneliness – combined with being depressed – makes it seem like it’s not as bad as it is; that I’m not. But it is. And I am. And I think I’m beginning to see that more now – not that I know if that’s a good thing yet, necessarily, however! Ha, ‘cause right now, it’s all looking like it’s too much for me, in truth. I’m just drowning in overwhelmedness, y’know? I feel both too depressed to cry and, yet also, almost physically paining from the sadness. I’m, too, totally restless – don’t have the concentration or patience for essentially anything. It’s hard to be present, and I have been smoking weed to distract myself too – I dunno what else to do, really! At least it passes the time. But, of course, I know that that’s not ideal or helpful etc. also. \\n\\nemm, to the point of the post though! haha. Well, I started chatting with another Redditor I found through one of those “make a friend” sort o’ groups. We lived in the same country! Both of us loved arcades, Veronica Mars and Studio Ghibli. Same mbti type (lol) and we were both struggling existentially as well. And that was kinda the plan, it seemed – we would drink some beer, play air hockey and talk about being depressed and our existential crises! haha. And, y’know what, I was really looking forward to it? It was the first time in months something happened that made me even a little happy; that I had something to look forward to; a possible friend! I have no friends here at all. Furthermore, the few I have at home in my own country, I can’t talk to them about my mental state or matters of existence. Or be comfortable sharing my feelings and problems with them, sadly. So to find someone that I could already talk to so openly, someone who seemed really cool, someone who seemed a bit like me.. was, for me, quite something! It just came out of nowhere – I hadn’t even known those friend subreddits existed! – it felt too good to be true, almost. But then again, I thought, maybe, I deserved a break for once too? \\n\\nBut anyway.. the fearing (and foreseeing, even?) that this potential new friend would just disappear or not reply or we’d never meet or something, in the end, proved true! That this would go bad like everything else. And it did, very sadly and confusingly. I clicked on the chat thread thing, a while ago tonight, and noticed that they’d deleted their account. Just like that! And it really hurt, to be honest. My life is bad enough as is. So to then, potentially, find a friend with the same personality type as me, some of the same experiences and interests, someone who I instantly felt at ease with and like they really got me.. and just have it ripped away from me like that.. really hurts. :( \\n\\nIt was tough and scary enough, in my current state, to even reply to their post that first day! So for this to happen now is pretty crushing. And it’s worse since it feels nearly inevitable? Like I knew it was coming – I was almost expecting them not to reply or to delete their account without saying anything, despite getting on so well. I don’t know.. I really needed a break in life; I really needed a friend too. And then this happens, of course.. My anxiety disorder of the social kind is, I know (!!), gonna hound me about this for a while to come – torturing myself over what I mighta said wrong or whatever. uggghh! Y’know? And, every time and day, it just gets harder to try in general. And I’m dissuaded from doing that and, as well, putting myself out there at all because of all the never-ending, inevitable-seeming disappointments. \\n\\nI give up!\\n\\n*runs away*', 'I don\\'t know how much longer I can take this emptiness.. It\\'s the weekend and feel like I want to die. I have no IRL friends, and someone I was talking to regularly on reddit for months has suddenly stopped responding. Weekends have been bad for me for a while, but lately they\\'re getting worse. I take medication for depression, but it\\'s not keeping the clouds away.  I can muddle through the week because I\\'m surrounded by people at work, and my job is such that I have to put on a convincing facade that I am calm and in control. Right now, I feel anything but. \\n\\nBit of background: My wife left me in June after less than 9 months of marriage. She went back to the father of her child, a man she had left twice before and with whom she had a history of drug use. She is an alcoholic and she is now on probation due to an alcohol-related incident. She also has bipolar disorder. We haven\\'t spoken in months, and I will probably never see my former stepson again, which crushes me because I loved him as my own son (I have no biological children).\\n\\nI\\'ve posted a fair bit about the breakup in my comments in various forums. I believe I was codependent, since  my entire world revolved around her. She was my best friend, my lover, my partner, everything. I went through so many ups and downs as I tried to help her with her alcohol addiction, which ultimately led to her getting arrested for DUI. I then got myself in lots of debt (she didn\\'t work) to pay for her legal expenses, which I am still paying because it would cost more to hire an attorney to enforce the decree than the debt is worth. Even though my life was somewhat chaotic with her bipolar and addiction issues, and her little boy running around, I love her and want my best friend back.\\n\\nI suppose it\\'s par for the course, though, given our relationship started when both of us were in a mental hospital. Beginning in January 2012, we hardly spent a day apart. We did everything together, right up until the night before she told me she was leaving. \\n\\nRight now I feel I have little to live for. My parents are about the only thing keeping me alive. If I killed myself it would destroy them. So, rather than take comfort in that, I find myself resenting them for not helping me end my life (I know it\\'s unreasonable of me to want this). I don\\'t want to keep living for them anymore.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to talk about this with people IRL because on paper, I\\'ve got it made. I\\'m young (31), educated (PhD), and I have a good job. I don\\'t have a lot of debt and my health is fairly good. But rather than make me feel better, I feel worse because I know that my life could get a  hell of a lot worse very easily, and if I hate it now, I\\'ll really hate it then.\\n\\nI just want a woman to love again (and one who loves me). I want to give her back and foot massages while we watch a good movie. I want to hold her in my arms on a rainy fall Sunday. I want to help her do chores around the house. I want to do nice things for her \"just because.\" I want to meet her family. I want to make love to someone again while feeling perfectly connected. I want someone to share a warped sense of humor with.\\n\\nI felt a bit like I understood what heaven was all about when I was with her. I want to know that the feeling of love is possible again. It if it isn\\'t, there\\'s no point for me to keep living.', \"One bottle of whiskey and two bottles of cheap wine. Loneliness sucks. As most people do, I've always lived a pretty lonely life. \\n\\nMy family isn't small. Five people, all either caught up in their own world or completely emotionally vacant. They cared the requisite amount to not be considered negligent, but nothing more. \\n\\nAt school, I never had many friends. I didn't have the best social skills and I have a small voice. Primary school was bearable. Lonely, but bearable. My friend got sick of me and moved to another group and I was stuck by myself again. I wasn't bullied or anything and I was doing well with the work, so it was okay.\\n\\nIn high school, I didn't have many friends either. Except this time my grades were falling and I developed a few mental problems (Anxiety, depression, eating disorder, etc) that hindered my social progress even more so. I can't remember half those years for the life of me. It's all just a numb, lonely, angsty blur to me now. But, it was bearable. Kind of. I was in year 11, the second last year of school when I fell in love with a guy named Ross. He was in a few of my classes and I loved watching him. It sounds creepy when I say it like that, okay? But it was just the way he moved. Or drifted. Every step was like some awesome choreography that only he knew. He had the eyes of a dreamer, always far away, in some secret world. I liked the way he spoke, the way he randomly answered questions in different languages, the way he preferred to talk about ideas rather than people. But most of all I liked the way he made me feel that glorious feeling that everyone had been going on about, that one that I had never been unable to understand. It was amazing. It was having a continuous high that you felt like you would never come down from. \\n\\nWe were paired together for a history project and became friends through that. Our friendship slowly developed and he began sitting with me at lunch time. It always made me so nervous, because I could barely hold a conversation, but he seemed to understand. He always spoke of the books he read. God, he read so much. It was usually a book a day. He was smart. \\n\\nOur friendship escalated over the next year. I opened up to him more, confided in him, and he accepted me. Even though I had him right next to me, I felt lonelier than ever because I knew that I could never bring myself to try and take our relationship to the next level. He always said I was like a sister to him, anyway. I was lonely and my depression was steadily getting worse again, but I still clung onto him like he was some sort of a drug, looking for that high again. He ended up getting a girlfriend later that year. It hurt. I always planned on confessing my feelings to him on graduation, but it never happened. I was still too shy. \\n\\nIt's been four years since I met him. After we graduated, we kept in contact but we were never as close as we used to be. Four years, and I still haven't moved on. I try, but it's difficult and I'm weak. \\n\\nHe's getting married tomorrow. I'm lonely, but I've got one bottle of whiskey and two bottles of cheap wine, so soon enough I won't even realize it. \", 'Somethings gotta change *kinda long, sorry*\\n\\n23M. A little info about me.  I was “popular” in middle school, which really isn’t saying much, but I was friends with everyone. I was a star athlete, I was smart, I had a bright future ahead of me. \\nThen something happened, and I still can’t figure out what it was..  I still remember the last day of 8th grade.  I was standing back by the locker room with my friends just shooting the shit waiting to get picked up. I had already said my end of the year goodbyes to everyone else, and these guys were my closest friends so everything was awesome.  We were all talking about what athletics would be like next year in high school while we threw the football around.  AND THATS IT.  That’s pretty much the last time I ever talked to anyone.  I remember freshman orientation, I walked into the auditorium expecting to shake hands and give hugs, but no one said anything to me?  Afterwards, I walked up to 3 or 4 different groups of “friends” and none of them seemed to want me around.  \\nAnyway, I get through freshman year alright, occasionally I’d hang out with some people, but that was a rare occasion. Me and my baseball coach didn’t really get along and at some point in my sophomore year we came to blows in the parking lot behind the field house.  I’ve always regretted that. He deserved an ass whoopin, but I deserved to play ball, I worked hard for that shit. I wasn’t going to be allowed back into athletics, so instead of serving a suspension, I dropped out and went to an alternative school.  \\nIt was a great school, it wasn’t the typical school you think of when you hear “alternative school”.  It was a small group of students (maybe 25) and teachers, some of which I already knew.  Anyway, I became pretty depressed after the realization that I wasn’t going to play baseball again.  My family started to notice and talked me into seeing a counselor.  It didn’t really work.  I was just passed around from clinic to clinic getting the same “I don’t think this was meant to work out, let me recommend someone I know..” bullshit.  Eventually I was diagnosed with Depression, Bipolar, and anxiety disorders.  Then the real problems started.  That was around 2014.  For the next 2&1/2 years all I did was pop Xanax.  And I mean, it was bad, like 60 MGs a day bad.  I had given up on everything and figured, Xanax probably wasn’t going to kill me, and as long as I’m on Xanax, I don’t have to think.  Got arrested for the first time my senior year.  Sitting in a cell during my graduation, which they didn’t even recognize me at.  And that’s that.  Since graduating, I haven’t done shit.  I’m still at my parents.  I don’t have a job.  I’ve gotten so big, that I don’t leave the house during the day in fear that someone I knew back in middle school might see me.  Or even worse, one of the girls I used to know.  I’m pretty much at the end here.  I don’t know what to do.  I’m so lonely, so bored with life, that I really just want to die.  I have no purpose.  I’m almost 24 and I haven’t done anything.   I read somewhere that when someone starts doing drugs the way I did before their brain is fully developed, that the person never really matures and is mentally stuck at the age in which they started doing the drugs.  I believe that may be the case with me.  I’m fully aware of what’s going on and how to change it, I just don’t want to.  I’m at the point I’d rather just die.  I banked too hard on baseball.  I never learned how to do anything else.  I can’t change the oil on my truck, but I can teach you how to shorten your swing and take a pitch to opposite field with 2 strikes, lol.  Pretty much useless information at this point..  \\nOn the bright side, I’m about to reach 4 years of sobriety!   \\nI don’t know what the purpose of this post was.  I haven’t had anyone to talk to in a long ass time, and I just needed to get this out.  I’m just real fucking lonely.  I really appreciate it if you read this far, I know it was a long rambling mess.  \\nIf anyone ever needs to talk, about anything, please feel free to message me.  I’m not good at much, but I think I’m pretty good at listening and making people feel better.  God bless.', \"Shattered after losses of friends and SO TW: Suicide attempt, no details though.  \\n\\n\\nFyi, I'm 34, FtM (he/him) - just wanted to avoid confusion.\\n\\nI thought after all this time, all the people I got to know... I wouldn't feel so lonely. But I do.What I feel like is a stepping stone. I become friends with people, and then I introduce them to others, and I end up just being left behind / forgotten.\\n\\nIt happens time and time again...\\n\\nI've been on a somewhat mental downhill since late 2019, then fell out with a friend completely March - April 2020 because they had taken to ignoring me for a month after disagreement, which is the worst thing you could do to me. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and my fear of abandonment is way up there. So it set it off and I had dissociated a bit.\\n\\nI finally got myself pieced back together during the summer despite COVID.And then I met someone online. I went on a trip, but I was talking to him alot. During the trip I planned another the very next month to go see him. He, himself, is also FtM. Early 20s.The time I spent with him was AMAZING. We meshed so well. We had great adventures. He trusted me so much, as a random person on the internet that he got to know, to come visit and stay with me in Airbnbs.\\n\\nBut seriously, I just felt so much joy and peace. And I was scared alittle, I felt as thought I was falling in love and I thought I couldn't. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend in 2011, from a 7 year relationship that had turned abusive and toxic. (Also finally cut her out of my life in 2020). And I had finally been okay with me being single.\\n\\nTl;dr - We both started calling each other partner.\\n\\nDec 2020, I found out my best friend was going to move to the middle of the US. Kinda close to my boyfriend. But it still hurt. I didn't have that many people around, so many friends had solid jobs, their partners, or even children. I held together because of my boyfriend.\\n\\nWe planned for me going to visit in May, and meeting up midway between where he lived and my best friend lived, for the 3 of us to hang. Boyfriend was excited and we were planning what we were going to do.\\n\\nBut shit is going on with his mother being controlling and abusive. I don't hear from him for 3 weeks, when we were talking almost everyday. There's alot of long and complicated things, but he basically ends up telling me to cancel the trip, then ghosts me for a month, then comes back saying lets just be friends, it hurts of course.Day after he says for me to unfollow him on social media because he has this weird thing about people he knows IRL seeing his posts, and he feels too vulnerable and pressured. It's a weird hangup. I get upset and tell him I feel like he's just trying to cut me out of his life. He reassures me that's not the case.2 days after? He drops a big message on me, saying he can't do this, he can't be the reason I had all this anxiety, I was crying, and just everything that had happened.\\n\\nHe ghosts me for a month.Finally talking after I threatened to come out there to get the things he borrowed from me- telling me he doesn't want to even be friends, saying I didn't do anything wrong (bullshit), and that's it's all him (bullshit). That he can't get passed what we did to each other. (him abandoning/ghosting me ; me making him feel watched/vulnerable)\\n\\nAnd I just... broke. For a week I didn't go to work. I didn't eat much. I hardly drank water. I was sleeping for 12 - 15 hours a day. It's only been 3? or so weeks since that. I wound up in the ER for an attempt at life, I had walked there myself.\\n\\nI feel so shattered. Alone. Friendless. I don't have any family. No parents. No siblings. Nothing.My friends were my family. I just hate not being as important to them as they are to me, because that's all I have. But they have so many other people and things going on that I'm not at all a priority.\\n\\nAnd I'm tired. I can't find the energy to do much.I'm at a shitty job. I had to give up school to work and survive.I just feel hopeless. I miss so many things. I miss feeling alive. I miss going up to see friends. I miss hanging out with my best friend in person. Online just doesn't cut it. I miss being physically close to someone. I just... I miss so much. I hate it.\\n\\nI can't even get help. Kaiser only is allowing one therapist appointment per month, because they don't have enough people. I'm trying so hard to find help that isn't going to cost me an arm and leg to do so.\\n\\nI don't know... I just feel like I've used up all my strength and hope. I feel like my age attributes to how I just don't feel like I can make deep connections with people anymore.I mean I did... and I just... I can't put that sort of effort in someone again with the risk of this happening. I almost ended my life from how much it hurt.\\n\\nI'm going day to day, going to a job that I'm not getting enough hours, not enjoying the things I once did, being alone, living with a housemate that is also my landlord and I just... don't talk to him. He's in his 50s, stressful, and odd. Very difficult to talk to, and he makes so much noise all the time. But it's where I can afford to live.\\n\\nI just... I don't know. I'm lost and hopeless.\", 'Just telling a little about myself. 3 years without physically talking to someone broke me completely. But, I will recover. I dont talk to someone irl for almost 3 years.\\nIts not really my intent to describe exactly why, or what could have been done. Not because I want to avoid, the exactly opposite, I already dedicated time to it excessively, and with accomplishments and results.\\n\\nBut here, I want to say something I am not used to, since I abandoned the self-pity trait (which was very high in the past) long time ago.\\n\\nBasically I need to say that my parents are crazy narcissistic and dont want me to leave home. I spent years in my room locked without talking to absolutely no one personally, with no exceptions. My father spent these years exclusively beating me and menacing my life, sometimes on a daily basis. And both my mother and father did nothing but say that I have a long list of defects not worth of listing here.\\n\\nI tried to escape, I failed, and everything that remained in my life was accepting that they would never let me leave home.\\n\\nThey strictly forbided me from another things, like getting a job or a girlfriend, but in the end, if I am locked in the house I dont have pretty much option.\\n\\nAs I said, I dont want to talk in detail about that. I just want to say that because covid, I was able to receive money from government as a help from unemployed. They of course hated it, but I could get the money anyway in the end.\\n\\nIt was enough for me to move out. I have plans for what to work now that I am in another place.\\n\\nBut I am severely depressed. And with severely, I really really mean that. Drinking water or eating is already an achievement sometimes.\\n\\nSome days I am more motivated, but will still fall in a depressed state.\\n\\nThe worst of it all, that I want to really address here. I am addicted to loneliness. Its scary how alone I am. Look, I have a really true friend online (very far away though), which completely understand my situation and help me. I have some other people to talk too. I usually isolate myself completely, but they, specially this friend, understand it.\\n\\nI am originally an extroverted person. I am originally not shy. Absolute social isolation for years in a row broke me completely beyound. I went really and complete insane at the beginning of the year, in part because the beatings started to become really frequent and I reached a point where I could not handle being alone anymore.\\n\\nI am extremely better now compared to february. Because of a intense process of self knowledgment and a genuine hero journey into myself and my mind.\\n\\nBut 3 years without seeing a face changed my personality. I can talk with tranquility with someone, but everyone irl is a stranger now, and people dont talk to strangers so much time. People are always into some kind of hurry. I can easily stop someone on the street and talk some shit, but in the end I will always eat my meals alone. 100% of time.\\n\\nMy biggest dream now, is talking a entire hour with someone very close and into the eyes. Do I find this hard? Not really. Yes, i became a bit anxious with this experience, but I can handle. The tragedy here is that I am completely normal and social in appearance, too normal to people ever realize I desire that much to talk to someone, so people never talk much. Its important to say that I have very sufficient and reliable evidence that I really dont look strange and my perceptions are fooled. I know by some evidences that I dont act with excentricity or weirdness.\\n\\nBut I dream... I dream so heavily in hugging someone. I dont touch another person (sexually and not sexually) for many years. I created a Tinder last week. Lots, lots and lots of matches. I am beautiful (i know because any people say that to me, M and F (the only ppl that say the opposite are my parents), but I have some anxiety with that. In contrast, I personally find myself not beautiful, but I know its 100% because my mother always said the opposite in these years.\\n\\nI can really get a hug someday, I know it for sure. It has been just 3 weeks since I moved out. The thing is that I just want now. I am desperate at this moment for social contact. The feeling is intense and painful. But ultimately I will be able with some work. I even seriously considered to pay a sex worker an just to talk to someone for an entire hour looking into the eyes, but I wont, because money is precious here and the only thing that separates me from my parents in this moment (i will receive money from gov until dec).\\n\\nI in the end will win this.\\nBut i just want you to know, who is reading all of this, and I very appreciate that, that I desire you never feel so desperate for social contact like me. Its the worst hell imaginable. Its legit torture for the soul. Nothing in your brain works anymore if you spend so much time alone.\\n\\nI ultimately remember that scene from the movie Interstellar. Dr Mann cried desperately hugging Cooper after spending 10 years alone in that alien ice planet, saying: \"Pray to never know how good it feels seeing another face again.\".\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2020, I used to cry because I could not handle my loneliness anymore. It was hard, but I survived. I am kind of used to it now.\\n\\nI think it\\'s crucial to say that I have a nice appearance, dont have any previously mental health issues, any syndrome, previous personality disorder or physical problem. I felt into this situation because of pure evil of some.\\n\\nI am not looking for self-pity. I actually never said this to no one before like that. Just someone from the world reading this make me happy.', 'Rambling a bit. I will tell my story and have a sort of pseudo philosophical approach to it all in order to let it out, put it in perspective etc. I am currently and 18 year old male. So in order to tell some of my life story, or well some of the bad stuff I will start with my childhood. Some memories from my childhood I can remember running into the bathroom as fast as I can and locking the door, and I managed to lock it right before the door handle went up and down really fast. Also I can remember him physically abusing me (not sexually fortunately) it has made me come to realize how prostitutes feel when they get fucked. It\\'s like they don\\'t really fuck her, they just fuck a piece of flesh, she has shut herself into herself in a way.  \\n \\nSo moving on, my school years was okay until the end of the first semester on high school, I probably had not completely been myself some time before that (I was starting to get depressed). But that is when depression really hit me. I have delayed sleep phase syndrome (diagnosed), also I am pretty sure I have non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome. I guess it\\'s not very uncommon to have mix of both rather than one or the other when it comes to that. Anyway I did not know I had these disorders in my high school time. I just thought I was more of an evening person than most. Well it eventually gave me serious problems, I could not fall asleep at night, no matter how many hours I spent in bed. Sometimes I just sat on the computer until I knew I was going to fall asleep. And every morning my parents dragged me out of bed, it\\'s not just that you get far too little sleep after getting forcefully dragged out of bed for many consecutive days, but it also is a great violation of your own \"authority, \"space\" don\\'t know what it really should be called. Well this and some other factors led to my depression. \\n \\nDepression is some nasty shit, I frantically paced back and forth in the house at night because my mind was not working like it was supposed to at that time. I sat in the darkness under a table in my room holding around myself. Physical pain is so little compared to the mental pain you suffer from that it actually eases the pain. Well I ended up in a mental hospital. At the time there my life improved a lot, and the depression faded away pretty quickly after I got anti-depressants and a lifestyle change. So eventually I also got to leave that place.  \\n \\nBut now when you return to the real world you have almost \"nothing\" I have a few friends I see from time to time. But not really too often, my sleep problems still persist and starting school again did not work very well. Sleep problems, I will not be surprised if I have the inattentive type of ADHD. So I was not able to finish school this time either, naturally there are probably more factors involved for that than just what was mentioned here, my self esteem is pretty shit after much negative feedback in my childhood even though it may not seem like it. I am desperate to move out of the house, as I hardly have any positive feelings left for my parents, and I probably behave very passive aggressively towards them even though consciously I try not to. but I also want to finish high school so I can get a degree in something later in life. but moving out would not be easy while going to high school.  \\n \\nNow I just feel empty and lonely inside. I am not able to get an emotional breakdown no matter how hard I try. And I know I should get an emotional breakdown or \"let it all out\" in a way, because there is a lot that needs to be released, but it seems impossible to me. it\\'s just hollow, empty and lonely inside. It seems to me that people often try to be like me in situations where they feel threatened in some way. Show no emotions etc, and it\\'s ironic because if you achieve it you strive for the exact opposite.  \\n \\nMy life has become almost nothing, I usually just sit on the computer, my sleep rhythm is fucked and I am tired of trying to fix it after having too many times spent 6+ hours in bed, constantly fooling myself thinking I will fall asleep. So now I just stay awake until I am so tired I know I will fall asleep and then go to sleep. I have some social interaction, I realized after a period of social isolation that we humans are more sheep than sheep. So social interaction is extremely important so I try to maintain that. but it is still not enough and I still am pretty empty and lonely inside.  \\n \\nWell this was an attempt to lighten the pressure, or let it all out. Even though it did not do anything that will drastically change my life, it offered some relief.\\n\\nEdit: To add some thoughts, I think loads has to do with the fact that we humans have shaped a world with technology etc that is not like the world that we humans are created for, because humans are stupid they have created a world that does not fit them. I think that tribe people, like the ones that live in the jungle or on some island in the ocean etc. actually are more happy less depressed and lonely. Because that kind of world naturally fits us better than the world we ironically have created.', 'My life fell apart. I\\'m getting better, but it\\'s taking a really long time and it\\'s hard without very many people I can talk to. It was about three years ago now when we first saw the symptoms. Well, she saw them first, as she told me later, but it didn\\'t really bother her. I didn\\'t notice until one night, when she said we needed to go out because she had something to tell me. We got to the bar and she told me, eyes wide, more excited than I\\'d seen her in a long time, that she had seen the most amazing house that day and that she wanted to buy it because it was perfect.\\n\\nWe weren\\'t looking for a house at the time. In fact, we hadn\\'t even been thinking about buying a house, at all. I was planning on quitting my job and going back to school in a year or so, and I didn\\'t know where we\\'d end up after that. It was actually a pretty terrible time for us to buy a house and settle down, but she was impervious to logic and just kept saying how she believed so firmly and so wholeheartedly that it was something we needed to do.\\n\\nIt took me a couple of weeks of research and spreadsheets and testimonials from friends before she reluctantly agreed to put the idea on hold. But from that point on, her behavior got more erratic. She started to get *really* excited about very small things, and *really* angry about other small things. It was like the gain had been turned up on her emotions. One night, she decided she wasn\\'t tired and couldn\\'t sleep, and so she stayed up all night. I was surprised when I walked into the living room and saw her productive, happy, and not the slightest bit tired. She didn\\'t go to sleep the next night, either. Or maybe she slept about an hour and then woke up, refreshed, and got back to work. This sleep schedule continued, and she said she felt fine and refused my entreatments for her to go see a doctor. I didn\\'t know what was happening, and I was starting to get very worried. It felt like a hard, heavy stone in my stomach that lasted all day, every day.\\n\\nShe had some ideas that she wanted to write down, and she\\'d started filling up a notebook with them. She was very meticulous when writing, and wrote each sentence in a different color. She had decided, very suddenly, that she wanted to quit her job and go back to grad school and get a PhD, and the next day she went to the local university and met all of the faculty in the department she wanted to apply to. She was more driven than I\\'d ever seen her, but she was getting increasingly hard to talk to, and the things she said made less and less sense. In the 10+ years that we\\'d been together, I\\'d never ever seen her like this. There were many painful and strange incidents that are now burned indelibly into my memory. One of the ones that I flash back to more than others is her standing in the middle of a grocery at 1AM yelling at me, furious about my reaction to some iced tea that she\\'d found, and yelling to everyone else that she wasn\\'t crazy and that I was just judging her. We were supposed to go home around 10 that night, but she refused to go home until 2 or so, desperate to explore for reasons that she didn\\'t explain.\\n\\nI looked up hotlines for people having mental breakdowns and crises, and called one of them and described what was going on and how I just couldn\\'t take it and didn\\'t know what to do. While I was on the phone, she came up and asked who I was talking to, and took the phone from me. She asked the woman, sincerely, if she was her boss at work. There was a timbre in her voice that I\\'d never heard before, like a mixture of mocking and all-out confusion. I still feel terrible remembering that way of speaking (and I wish that was the last time I\\'d had to hear it).\\n\\nWhen she handed the phone back to me, the person on the other end told me in no uncertain terms that my wife was having a full-on psychotic break and that I had to get her to a hospital as soon as possible, and then hung up. I told her that we needed to go to the hospital and she *ran* away. Just ran and ran. I chased her, worried for her, as I called 911. As she ran she yelled at people and stopped and put a girl in a headlock and kept running and running. By the time the paramedics got there, nearly everyone on the busy street we were on had seen this and there was quite a bit of attention on us. She was singing to herself and asking nonsensical questions to the paramedics and was 100% in a world of her own. She got a little violent when they asked her to calm down and talk to them. I can still see her handcuffed to the railing as the police and paramedics interviewed her, convinced that she was on some insane drug trip. They kept asking me what drugs she\\'d had, and no one believed me when I told them she\\'d had none at all.\\n\\nI followed them to the hospital. She was sedated and strapped down and they were testing her for many things. She was dehydrated and in quite a bad physical state, but they found no drugs. I knew they wouldn\\'t. They told me that she\\'d need to talk to a psychiatrist, but it was pretty unmistakably a psychotic break caused by bipolar disorder. (This didn\\'t come as a total surprise to me, as I\\'d already started to google her symptoms as things were getting worse, even though she wouldn\\'t let me take her to the doctor.)\\n\\nThe next day I picked her up from the hospital. She was groggy and mad, and barely wanted to talk to me out of anger for having called 911. She saw me as the reason she\\'d gone to the hospital--not the paramedics or the police who thought she was a danger to herself in the state she was in, but me, who \"just couldn\\'t deal\" with how she was.\\n\\nOver the next few days, she got worse. I\\'ll summarize a bit, but it played out kind of like you might think it would, it you were a total pessimist. She refused to see a psychiatrist and started to look into naturopathic medicine. She got even worse, mentally, than she\\'d been before. I talked to the mental health people in the county government and they came to evaluate her. She was really, really badly off. They decided to commit her to a hospital for a week, and then, for a month. She hated it--absolutely hated it--and I felt terrible. She was finally on medication now, and showed noticeable improvement in the first week or so, but little to no improvement for the next few weeks after that.\\n\\nI visited her every day in the hospital, but it took a lot longer than her hospital stay for her anger to subside. I can still remember the long drive to the mental hospital. I listened to public radio on the way over, to try to calm my nerves. (I still mentally associate All Things Considered with seeing her at her worst.) I got to the hospital and it was cold inside, which matched how I felt inside myself, too. I waited until visiting hours started and filed in with a group of other concerned family members, all of them looking impossibly sad--and for some of them, noticeably embarrassed to be there. I still remember the \"elopement risk\" warnings on the door as I walked in. Usually the risk was \"low,\" but sometimes it was \"high.\" I wondered what it was that caused them to change it.\\n\\nEventually, she left the hospital. She wasn\\'t fully better yet, but she was a little better, I guess. She\\'d been unable to do her job in the hospital, and I actually had to go on her behalf and coordinate with her coworkers to make sure her work was taken care of. She hated me for that, even though I did so much work to try to help her. Her coworkers were more understanding than I thought they\\'d be.\\n\\nOver the next few months she improved noticeably until nothing was wrong anymore. She was back to herself. She saw a psychiatrist regularly and was on medication and there was a little bit of hope inside me that we wouldn\\'t ever have to deal with this again. Our marriage was noticeably shaken, but I thought that maybe, if we both tried really hard, we could get it back to as good as it originally was, or close.\\n\\nAbout a year and a half later, I quit my job to go back to school to pursue my dreams. It was a really scary time for both of us, but we had some savings and we were determined to make it work. I couldn\\'t believe how supportive she was. It was scary, but it was a leap we were making together.\\n\\nI remember that it was about a month later, the day after her birthday, when the symptoms started again. She was in a great mood. Her being in a great mood wasn\\'t unusual, but I could hear something unusual, and familiar, in her voice. The timbre of her voice had changed again. I felt it in my stomach before I thought about it consciously... she was manic again. I knew immediately and started feeling sick. I may have vomited in the first 10 minutes after realizing that it was happening again; I don\\'t remember. I do remember calling her doctor on the phone and frantically trying to get him to prescribe her more medication to bring her down before she went all the way up. He agreed to come and take a look, but she refused to take all of the medication he prescribed as it made her too sleepy. She started not sleeping again, and this time, things escalated really, really quickly.\\n\\nIt was about a week before she was in the hospital again. I wasn\\'t even involved this time; she\\'d tried to get into a sports game without paying (it made sense to her; she wasn\\'t trying to not pay, but was simply going in to look for a friend she thought might be there). A cop picked her up and was concerned for her mentally, so he took her to the hospital where they kept her for observation. She left the next day, but before another week had passed she was back in the hospital. When she got back out, she was angry, violent, furious. She took my keys from me and screamed at me to leave and bit my hand when I tried to get them back. I left, defeated, and called a good friend.\\n\\nI stayed at his house for weeks. In the meantime, she called me to curse at me and occasionally came over to yell at me or drop off strange items that she thought I needed. One night she called me and told me she\\'d slept with someone else... the first time she\\'d actually slept with someone else other than me in her entire life. I was punched in the gut. I asked her how she could do something like that, and she yelled at me that I was in no place to judge her and hung up on me. (For the record, she was and still is the only person I\\'ve ever slept with.)\\n\\nI sank deeper into depression. It was a hole. A huge hole. Deeper and deeper and the outside world went away and I was just sad and I slept. I considered suicide but also just didn\\'t have the energy to think about anything besides how much I hated everything that was happening. I was scared and lost, and I found myself trying to wake myself up, over and over again. \"Wake up! Wake up! This is all a dream, wake up!\" I didn\\'t believe it, but I wanted to believe it, so badly. If only I could just wake up from the nightmare that was happening and go back to our life together.\\n\\nShe continued to stay with this guy, and called me to tell me about him. She was living with him... he was living at *our* apartment. My friends gave me a lot of support, and I reached out as much as I could bring myself to do. But honestly, I didn\\'t and couldn\\'t reach out as much as I needed.\\n\\nOne night I asked if I could come get my stuff out of the apartment. I was going to move into a new apartment, on my own. Things weren\\'t getting any better with her, and I was wearing out my welcome with my friend, so I didn\\'t have much choice. I went with a couple of friends, for emotional support... and also, because I was scared. When I got there she was wild. Manic. Yelling and screaming at us and screaming at me and that son of a bitch was there and I wanted to hurt him so badly but I\\'ve never been a violent person and anyway I was too preoccupied with her. Things escalated and she attacked my friend and me as we were trying to get inside to claim some of my stuff and we backed off but my other friend called the cops. They came and she was out of control and violent. They arrested her and she went to jail, for the first time in her life.\\n\\nDays later, the county decided to commit her and she went to the hospital for a month. I visited her a couple of times there, but she told me she hated me and didn\\'t want me visiting her anymore. She asked me to stop coming, and I acquiesced. The times when I did come, she spent most of the time talking about her new boyfriend or yelling at me until the staff had to tell her to calm down.\\n\\nThis whole time, I was a new grad student at a new school with new people and I was struggling to hold things together academically. It was hard and I felt like a total loser as my grades and self-esteem dropped. Luckily, I talked to some support staff at the university and they set me up with a therapist, and I had understanding advisors who helped me to not fail my classes. I\\'m still so thankful to them for what they did. I wasn\\'t out of my bad place, but at least I wasn\\'t in a worse place.\\n\\nThat was a year ago. Since then I\\'ve done better in school and gotten some amazing internships. Everyone says I should be happy about the success that inevitably awaits me, but I just feel like shit, and alone. Almost none of my new friends know about this. I haven\\'t even told the vast majority of my friends at school that I\\'m married. I kept this all from them and only told my close friends from before. This isolated me emotionally from a lot of the people I see on a daily basis, but it also kept me from having to talk about it when I didn\\'t want to... and from feeling pitied by others. And yet I feel sad to have isolated myself as much as I have and to have shown a fake mask to most of the people I know.\\n\\nShe\\'s been out of the hospital for a little over a year now. She only stopped dating that son of a bitch a couple of months ago, after the relationship became too acidic for her to deal with. She kicked him out and told me she wanted to be back with me. I can tell she\\'s sincerely sorry and knows she\\'s fucked up terribly. And I still love her immeasurably despite everything that\\'s happened. I know that she\\'s been through a lot of pain as well... many of the things that she did that hurt me are classic symptoms of bipolar disorder and I can\\'t put all of the blame on her--it just wouldn\\'t be right to and I feel so terrible for her having to go through all of this. But over a year of knowing that she was with him has hurt me more than I can adequately put into words. That entire time I just felt a dull scraping against my heart, like my emotions were gradually eroding, or at least hardening, until I couldn\\'t feel anything anymore. By the time she was away from him, it was too late... I\\'d given up. I don\\'t think I\\'ve moved on, but I did give up.\\n\\nI filed for divorce about a month ago. My friends--the few who know--are supportive and say that I made the right choice. But I just made the choice that seemed slightly less bad of two choices that both seemed really terrible. I loved her more than anything in my life. We both thought we\\'d be together forever and so much of our relationship was pure magic. So many amazing beautiful memories and things that happened between us that seemed like we were destined to be together. All of that is behind me now, and turning away from that brilliant, shining light, I\\'m blinded to anything that might be ahead of me. I\\'m just hoping that somehow I can recover from this and find myself again, because the way it feels right now, it seems like I left whoever I was behind.\\n\\nAnyway, if you\\'ve read all of this, or any of this, thank you. I\\'ve never really typed this story up before and I\\'m kind of surprised that I was able to without freaking out from flashbacks (which still happens to me occasionally). I\\'m in a better position now than I was a year ago, and I haven\\'t seriously thought of suicide in a while. I meet with my therapist regularly and I\\'m on antidepressants. It\\'s just... I know people say \"healing takes time,\" but I never thought that the wounds of my memories could feel so fresh even after over a year has passed.\\n\\n**tl;dr: Right after I quit my job, my marriage fell apart due to my wife\\'s mental illness, and it\\'s been a really rough time all around.**', 'I’m filled with so much self-doubt, worry, and anxiety Where do I begin? I am actively trying to stay in control of my life and my destiny, but the anxiety and depression is a hurdle I have to maneuver every day that it’s so hard to remain lucid. I feel so beaten down by my own mind. I see a therapist generally every other week, and have been for a few years now, but that only does so much. I tried looking into CBT but the cost is exorbitant! I feel so alone and it’s so hard to constantly feel these feelings. One of the hardest parts is that so few people know I suffer by these mental disorders. I am so good at hiding it, and I feel like no one wants to hear my shit time and time again. When I’m out in public or at work, I’m so gregarious and nice, outgoing and all that shit you need to be in business. But at home, I feel so alone, so sad and unhappy, worried about so much, and the heavy crying that I go through, like right now.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nTL/DR: I suffer from anxiety, work makes me nuts, I’m very very lonely and unhappy, and I’m trying my damn hardest to stay focused to make a major change in my life and move to another country, a tall order! This is long so thank you to anyone that takes the time in their day to just read my post, and big thanks to anyone that takes the extra time to respond with some feedback, and maybe some nice words. Thank you, Reddit!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI’ve recently decided I am going to aim to move to Portugal next August 1st! A huge, life changing event. I presently work in Corporate America and have been working in it at the same company pretty much since I graduated undergrad six years ago. It has been such a challenging six years with so many shifting emotions, highs and some real lows. I’ve changed jobs a few times internally, always hoping the next one will be a better experience, something that can make me feel fulfilled. Although my current job is maybe my ‘favorite’ one, I feel like I’m under so much pressure that generally hate it, not to mention I couldn’t give two shits if things fail or not. To be honest, I’ve never liked working at my company and have really struggled at changing companies.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI got laid off last year and thankfully I got another job internally shortly thereafter; however, I knew for months this was coming, I did everything you are supposed to do when job hunting, I mean, I really was fucking hustling to get in front of people, and I never got a shot, just close to a shot. I pretty much got in touch or back in touch with everyone I knew, meeting people with several degrees of separation. I looked for 11 months and only had internal interviews. Granted, internal interviews are better than none and a lot to be thankful for, it was a hard pill to swallow because it was my only shot at staying employed to keep paying the bills.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe alarm bells have been ringing for years but I’ve always acted against what may be so obvious to others. I went into Corporate America at the advice and push of my parents, who just want the best for me. I have older parents than my peers so if you were 18 and your parents were in their late 40s – 50s, mine were already at retirement age, I grew up watching them go through their own significant struggle and pain, so with parents like this they aren’t going to tell you to follow your dreams, they’re going to tell you to go into a practical field and focus on your retirement fund because they have nothing to show for a lifetime of work. They’re advice is very real, but over 10 years after getting that advice I’ve been nothing but unhappy with my work for years. I’ve tried and tried to find satisfaction outside of work, and just treat work as work, but I am just not wired like that. I’ve done and still do a lot of volunteering, I’ve invested in many hobbies, but the work angle really buries my happiness. The biggest red flag is over the years is when I get bogged down by my anxiety at work, I think about how killing myself would end all this pain I have. Pain in my mind, and when the anxiety persists for hours, it becomes physically painful. But I make it to the end of the day, go home, and do it all over again the next day. The worst part is that my loneliness is amplified at work. I have to stay composed, I can show my hand, and that is maddening. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nOne really hard thing about my career is that what I would love to do doesn’t translate into a career where you can support yourself. Money has been a poison to my mind. Seeing my parents struggle with money has traumatized me. Watching my mom skirt creditors, crying herself to sleep, to my dad getting laid off because the big corporation he worked for was run into the ground by executives that still came out on top, only to never be hired again because he was 64 at the time, to see him go from a jet setting executive to someone that was put to pasture was really hard. Although they both seem to be happy and OK, money is the defacto problem in their life, and arguably mine. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI’ve struggled with saving. Although I am stashing a good amount in my retirement, living in a large metropolitan city doesn’t make it easy to save. This year I helped my dad with some expenses and put the extra cost on my credit card. So I’ve been in the red all summer and potentially through the end of this month. I looked at my budget today and I was disappointed that I may not be able to pay off the card this month, just because of general recurring expenses that add to the balance. So I pretty much have been living pay check to pay check. I also had some difficulty with my landlords, too. Although that sort of breezed over, there has been an awkward silence but business as usual, I’m month to month so I feel like I have to tread carefully so I don’t get a notice to leave or my rent gets raised. This constant feeling of financial insecurity is awful. It makes me feel like my mother, always worried about money. I hate that! I hate that so so so much!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nRecently my anxiety has been terrible. On top of the landlord drama (who by the way have really shown their true colors and what pieces of shit people they are) work anxiety has been absolutely awful this month. I was falling apart to my dad and for the first time he told me that my work needs to change vs. hanging tough because it’s a good corporate job. We talked about fulfilling my dream of moving overseas where he lives (short story, he moved to another country and was able to do everything legally because of a special program for retirees) and that a way to do that is to teach English. So I’ve decided to keep paying my piece of shit landlords and tread softly to save money for this endeavor. A huge order because I have to get the TEFL, prob do it online because I don’t have the consistent schedule in the evenings to go to a class (not a fan of online). So I have this plan but pursuing it has been really hard. The nature of the tall order, on top of my day to day anxiety, has made it really hard to stay focused and have the energy to do research after work or on the weekends. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI get so worried that I won’t follow through with this. Or some money thing will get in the way that will hamper my savings plan. Or I will get fired from my job. Or my landlords will flip over some more bullshit and try to intimidate me (I need to go to the legal advice thread for this). What ends up happening is that I shut down and feel so overwhelmed and alone. And I have no one to call. No one to just share my pain with because they’re like me, they want to help others not feel the pain that they have to live with. I really hope I succeed at getting this TEFL, at savings, and making through each week at work and think about suicide less even though I may be stressed, and achieving this goal to just take a chance and do something entirely different. I really hope I can make it.', 'My first relationship in nine years only lasted a week. Before I get into this, I wanna say that this is gonna be very lengthy. Also if someone out there suffers from Depression, a Depressive Disorder, or PTSD, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on all of this along with advice.\\n\\nBack in 2013, A cousin of mine tried to date this girl that lived a town over from us. He met this girl through a friend of ours and traveled to the next town over to have a first date with her. They had the first date, he went back home and messaged her, she ghosted him for a solid week and then told him that she didn\\'t want to date him. They remained friends and he told me that I should try to go after her because me and her were basically the same person, and that it would work out good. I added her on Facebook back then and thought that she was cute, but I never went after her until this year.\\n\\nI found out back in May that she had a Nintendo Switch and that she also had Animal Crossing, and being a major fan of Animal Crossing and thinking she\\'s cute, I tried my hand at seeing how it would go. I messaged her on May 31st talking about the game and how she was doing in it and everything was going wonderful. A day or two later, we were playing Animal Crossing together and the first time she came to my island, there was multiple shooting stars in the sky, and as nerdy and lame as it sounds, I took that as a good sign. We continued to get to know one another and things were looking good.\\n\\nAbout four days into us getting to know one another, we both got horny and she ended up sending me a pic of her boobs. While I liked it of course, I had a similar experience with another girl in the past who did this, and I needed to have a talk with her about this. I explained how I didn\\'t want the focus to be on sex or anything sexual, and that we shouldn\\'t rush into anything and just take things slow, get to know one another, and see how that goes because I wanted to have a relationship with her soon. She agreed with me on everything and apologized for the way she acted, and that we could take things slow, but there would be times where she would act like herself because that\\'s the way she is and I had no problem with that.\\n\\nThings were going really good up until I found out that there was a guy that was texting her on snapchat late at night, and I asked her about it and she told me that she used to work with him at her old job and that they were really good friends. It mostly concerned me because she had confessed to me early when we were getting to know one another that she had sex with a guy she used to work with at her old job, and that she used to have sex with a couple of guys in the past, but that she wanted to be serious now.\\n\\nI decided to talk to her about the guy that she had sex with at her old job, and she told me about how she didn\\'t want to talk about it and that it wasn\\'t important and didn\\'t matter because that was in her past. She also explained in detail about how many guys she had sex with and it wasn\\'t a whole lot, and that she was friends with some of the guys that she had sex with in the past, but that it never escalated to anything past friends, and that if they tried it she would cut them out of her life for good. She also explained about the guy that she worked with that she was talking to on Snapchat and that they were really close friends and that she talked to him about everything, including me, and that he was happy for her that she had found somebody and that she was happy now. I didn\\'t worry to much about things after that and I believe her because everything she was saying was truthful.\\n\\nEverything was going awesome. She would have deep conversations with me about things, confess things to me and I would do the same with her. I literally felt like she was the one for me. I had never met a girl that I could talk about anything with, was like myself, shared the same interests but was also different, and also be sexual and intimate with me. I truly felt like this was the one. My soulmate. She told her family and friends about me and she seemed really happy for the first time in a long time in her life, and I felt the same about my life too.\\n\\nA few weeks back she told me about how she had no other choice but to give her cat up of 2-3 years to the local animal shelter. I asked if she could give her cat to a family member or friend and she told me that she messaged everybody she could think of and that nobody wanted her cat. She said that she didn\\'t want her cat to be killed by some dogs that lived on her street. I told her that, even though it\\'s horrible that she has to give her cat up to the shelter, it was for the best because her cat had a better chance of living than being killed by the dogs. She told me that she understood that, but that her cat got her through some very rough times in her life and that she hated it. She sent me a video on snapchat shortly after of her crying because she didn\\'t wanna give her cat up. I comforted her and helped her get her mind off of everything going on and later on that night, she had told me that I make her super happy, and she thanked me for messaging her about Animal Crossing and that it changed her talking to me. I confessed that she was the best thing to ever happen to me, and that love can hit you out of nowhere and it\\'s indescribable what it did for us. She told me about how she had never been this happy before and that it\\'s weird for her but she loved it. She told me that I was her person and that she could feel it. I told her that I feel the same way and that originally I was adamant that I wasn\\'t gonna believe in love anymore until she came into my life and how I felt the same way that she did, and that it\\'s like we\\'re made for one another. She agreed and said that we were so much alike yet so different at the same time and that it just works for us. She told me that I was so amazing and that she wanted to have me forever. That was on June 25th, and we were on cloud nine.\\n\\nAlso around the end of June, she kept trying to get me to ask her out, and at the time I wasn\\'t fully comfortable with asking her that just yet because I wanted to wait a month. I\\'m just weird like that I guess. Then on July 2nd at Midnight, I was on the phone with her and I asked her to get on Animal Crossing. I bought her a crown and sent it in a letter to her that read \"You\\'re the queen of my heart.\" I told her to check her mail and when she seen it, I asked her if she wanted to be one with me in Body, Mind, and Soul. She said yes and we started dating. I made it official on Facebook and all my friends were so happy. She was my first relationship in nine years.\\n\\nThings were going awesome and she was a girl I could confess anything to and have a conversation with about anything. I remember how on the Fourth of July we both confessed to one another about our mental health, and she had told me that she had Major Depressive Disorder along with PTSD and Anxiety because she had a bad past, and I told her about how I had ADHD along with Depression and Severe Anxiety. In this conversation, I confessed to her about how it might be too early to say this, but that I loved her. She told me about how she was here for me no matter what and that she thought she loved me, but it was hard for her to tell because she didn\\'t know love in that kind of way because she couldn\\'t show emotion like a normal person. She said that she loved her family, but that she didn\\'t tell them that because she didn\\'t know if it was really love because it was warped in her head. I told her about how it was understandable that she couldn\\'t process feelings and love because of her past, and that I was here for her no matter what and that I cared for her, and that I hoped she cared for me in that way too. She told me that she did care for me so much and how it was gonna take time for her to process her feelings to express them more to me. She also told me that, out of all the people she cared deeply about, I was on that list. She told me the other people on that list was her family, and that I was on that list of people that she wanted in her life no matter what. I told her that I felt the same way about her and I took comfort in knowing that.\\n\\nOn July 6th, she was at Her Dad\\'s, and she sent me a photo on Snapchat of her in a dress Her Grandma gave her. I told her that she looked cute in it and she posted a photo of herself on Facebook wearing the dress along with a status that said that I called her cute and that she loved it. This was the last day that she was herself. After that day, things started going downhill.\\n\\nAbout a week ago, I was talking to her on the phone one night and she told me about how she dreaded the next day and I asked why? she told me that she didn\\'t want to explain it and that she just didn\\'t want to do what she was about to do the next day and that she will hate it for a long time. It didn\\'t take me long after that to catch onto what she was meaning. She was giving her cat up to the shelter the next day. So the next morning, [I sent her this.](https://imgur.com/a/o17BetC) Not only to be sweet but to let her know I\\'m here.\\n\\n [An hour later this was the only thing she said to me.](https://imgur.com/a/IpQONDd)\\n\\n I kept supporting her and talking to her and she said to me that she felt bad, and that if you don\\'t hear a lot from me today, that\\'s why. I told her to take all the time that she needed. She talked to me here and there that day, but not a whole lot. Later on that night, I asked if I could call her. She said to me that she would think about it, but it was probably gonna be yes. She also told me about how she didn\\'t want to talk about her cat and didn\\'t want to talk about anything sad. I said okay that sounds good and things were going good on the phone. Now 99% of the time that we\\'re on the phone, we facetime one another. She didn\\'t want to do that during that night, which I could understand because of what had happened that day.\\n\\nWe fell asleep on the phone and the next morning, she seemed mean, as she usually does when she wakes up from sleep at all. She told me that she had to go babysit her cousins and that she would talk at me later. About two hours later, she sent me a video on snapchat saying that she had smoked some weed and that she was feeling better. She also had said that her cousin was at her house instead and she sent me another vid of her cousin. I didn\\'t hear from her again until five hours later. She messaged me telling me that she had took a nap, and we called and talked on the phone again, but no facetime again. She immediately fell asleep about 30 minutes onto being on the phone with me.\\n\\nThe next morning was the same as the last, she was mean and then told me that she was gonna take a shower and message me back later. About two hours later, she sends me a video on snap saying that she had mexican food and some weed and that today is going to be a good day. So she smokes some weed and talks to me for a little bit, and eats the mexican. I don\\'t hear from her again for five hours and she messages me telling me that she took a nap. After that she went back down to her cousins house to smoke some more weed. Then she told me about how she was going to bed because she had a headache and that she couldn\\'t find her blood pressure medicine because she has high blood pressure. So we said goodnight to one another and she messaged me the next morning.\\n\\nShe woke up Saturday morning and told me that she still had a really bad headache, but that she had found her blood pressure medicine. I told her to just get some rest and see if it goes away to which she said that she planned on it. About an hour later, she messages me saying that she\\'s in and out of sleep but that her headache is easing up to which I said that\\'s awesome! A few hours later, she messages me saying yess and that apparently she was going fishing now, and if I don\\'t hear anything from her, that\\'s why. I said oh okay I hope you have some fun and she said I hope that I catch something. I also had asked her about who she was going with and she told me her cousins. She sent that message to me around 5 PM. At around 12 AM, I seen that she had previously been online on Facebook. I checked my messages on snap and seen that she read my message, but didn\\'t reply back, which scared me. In the almost three months that we\\'ve deeply known each other, she had never left me on read and I instantly got flashbacks about being ghosted in the past by girls. So I decided to message her on Facebook messenger and [This is what she said to me.](https://imgur.com/a/47dJKLo) The audio message that I sent was me saying oh okay, I seen that you opened my snap message but didn\\'t reply back and I got concerned.\\n\\nI talked to her Sunday and she seemed miserable and was being mean here and there at times but also being sweet too. I asked how she was feeling and she said that she felt like she couldn\\'t breathe and that her allergies were killing her so she decided to take some Benadryl. After that we talked for a little bit more and she fell asleep and messaged me back later.\\n\\nI asked her that night if I could call her and she said once she got back from her cousins house smoking weed that I could call and so I did. While we were on the phone, she was playing Animal Crossing, and usually we have a good conversation while she\\'s playing too. She barely said anything the entire time we were on the phone. I kept acting like my usual self and was being funny too like I usually do, and while she did laugh here and there, most of the time she was deadpan. Just silent and at one time, tried to argue. She was just so serious the whole time and I had never seen her that way. She told me about how she had to babysit her cousins in the morning and that she didn\\'t wanna do it.\\n\\nI asked her due to her not talking a lot if she still felt bad. She told me that she did and that she still felt tired. Then after 51 minutes of being on the phone with me, she told me that she was gonna walk down to her cousins and stay all night. She told me that she would message me when she got down there. We talked for a little bit, and then she fell asleep.\\n\\nMonday, she didn\\'t say anything to me and ended up changing her Facebook cover photo from me to something else and then around noon, [she sent this to me.](https://imgur.com/a/jh1CVz0) \\n\\nI said in response to her about how I\\'m shocked and hurt and that it kinda felt like in the beginning that we were friends when we were talking about Animal Crossing and playing Animal Crossing together and that we were friends and that we started crushing on one another. I also agreed that at times it did feel like we were going too fast with things like the nudes and dirty talk, but that we had a talk about this, and I reminded her about how I told her how I felt like we needed to lay low on the sexual stuff because I didn\\'t want it to be a focus on that and how I didn\\'t want it to feel like we were rushing into something and how I felt like we should take it slow and get to know one another a little bit better, and how it felt like that way and it felt like we were doing that. I also said to her that I didn\\'t know that she felt like me as just a friend and not in that way because I felt that way about her. I also reminded her of how she said to me that you feel like I was the right one for you and you felt it, but after putting thought into it, that wasn\\'t the feeling. I said to her that I couldn\\'t understand why she couldn\\'t come to me in the past and say \"Hey, we need to talk about this, I\\'m having this feeling.\" and that we could have done something right then and there, and I told her that with the way that we talked to one another minus the nudes and dirty talk that I felt something really true and a true connection to her and that I felt that I really found the right person for me through her and that I wasn\\'t trying to make her out to feel bad, that this was just coming from my heart, and that it just hurt me to know this. I told her that I cared for her and really liked her, and to hear that news really hurts me. I told her that she doesn\\'t feel the same way that I do on this and that I just wished that we could have talked about all of this and tried to fix it, but that there ain\\'t no use in that anymore I guess. I told her that it\\'s cool if you wanna be friends and that\\'s fine and that I\\'m okay with that. I told her again how I just wished that we could have talked about this more and how I wished that we could have talked about her feeling confused and stuff, but that it\\'s okay and fine. I told her that she had better things to do with her life than to spend with me and I respect that. I wished her the best of luck in life wherever she may go, and that I would be here as her friend.\\n\\nShortly after that I had posted a sad tweet and I posted a photo of myself on Instagram. She unfollowed me on Twitter and Instagram shortly after. Yesterday, I had viewed her Snapchat Story and she had tweeted for the first time in a week 10 minutes after viewing her story a gif of a little girl rolling her eyes saying cry me a river and wrote \"constant mood\" over top of it. After that, she blocked me on snapchat and unfriended me on Facebook even though I hadn\\'t said anything to her since she sent me the break up text on Monday.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if she\\'s having an episode of PTSD/Depression, or if she truly hates me forever, or if she\\'s taking a break from me. All I know is that it fucking sucks that all of this happened. Everything was going so good between the two of us and then after she gave the cat up, she didn\\'t act like herself and things just fell apart. I read online that people with PTSD use Emotional Avoidance to cope, and that people with PTSD have trouble\\xa0experiencing positive feelings such as happiness or love. That could explain why she said the past few days she hasn\\'t been happy with me because a few days ago is when she gave her cat up. I kinda believe that she could be experiencing an episode of Depression/PTSD where she gave the cat up and she truly cared for the cat and this is how she copes. All my friends tell me to give her some space and time and she will message me back eventually. I kinda believe that, but I\\'m not sure. I know she posted a photo on her Instagram today of her in the pool. I don\\'t think I could date her again because if she lost it over something like this, I could only imagine what it would be like if we got into an argument or something big happened. I just hope that she doesn\\'t hate my guts forever and that we can just be good friends.\\n\\nTL;DR I met a girl through a cousin, started talking to her and playing Animal Crossing with her, we developed feelings for one another, we started dating, things were going awesome, she told me that she had Depression and PTSD and that she was giving her cat up to the animal shelter, she ended up giving up the cat to the shelter, she started not acting like herself shortly after, and then broke up with me and unfriended me off all social media.', 'I’m crushed, and just generally done. I feel deeply unlovable. And this is probably going to be one big fat “woe is me” diatribe but...I’m just done. I’m angry, hurt, frustrated, and lonely and just...done. I don’t really know where to begin. It’s really as simple as “no one likes me, and the loneliness is crushing”.\\n\\nMy mother has severe untreated mental illness, and has been emotionally abusive all my life. Lately, she most enjoys spending her days sending me scathing hate mail (particularly on holidays, or when she knows I have an exam coming up). Without any response from me to fuel this. It’s been 2 years of no contact on my end. She actively tries to destroy my relationships with other family members, friends, and professional contacts (eg telling people I’m abusive, sending me emails stressing how the friends I have “don’t really like me” and people only “tolerate” me). I’ve got pretty low self-esteem to begin with/serious self-doubt, and it really doesn’t help. I’m now seeing a psychiatrist/have been in therapy which helps a bit, but it doesn’t really undo the damage. It kills me that my own mother despises me. \\n\\nMy dad doesn’t care to know me or my life. The only time he demonstrates concern for my “welfare” is when faced with the prospect that he might lose his bragging rights (eg I had to take a medical leave of absence from medical school, and suddenly he cared a lot about “making sure I didn’t get lazy!” and “this is just temporary - right? RIGHT?!”). He never calls. He never visits. He doesn’t work and has all the time in the world.  When we do talk, all he’s concerned about is my educational progress (“New scholarships? Where’s your MD at? How much longer before your Master’s is finished? How about that (highly identifiable diploma program in a particular area of specialization)?”). He used to drive out of town 2 hours (one way) every week to see my brother in prison. I’m along that route/only one extra hour away so I’d repeatedly volunteer to meet him in the town where he meets my brother. He would never call to let me know when he was coming up, nor would he ever commit to dates. I’d only hear about it later. Yet everyone under the sun hears about “how proud” he is of me, and “how much I take after him”. I end up in the hospital and he doesn’t even text. He ends up in the hospital and I head out day or night (several times over...). He hardly knows me, and has no desire to. If I want to see him around the holidays, I have to practically beg him to make time for me (and naturally, I’ll be the one to drive down to visit). This year it all just made me feel worthless. \\n\\nThe latter statements can be applied to most of my family. I exist, but no one ever calls (I’m always having to do the calling, and heaven forbid I leave a message for someone to “call me back when they have a chance!” because I’m younger therefore it’s my place to be doing all the calling, apparently). Few ever respond when I call or text. It’s not like I don’t try. It’s not like I don’t make active efforts to be in their lives (attending grads, bday parties, just wishing people “happy Monday!” Or “good luck on that interview!” Etc). People will tell me about their lives but never ask me about mine. I remember their significant dates, but hardly anyone remembers my birthday. And it’s not like they don’t even care sometimes, more like they actively dislike me, for reasons I don’t fully understand. Like, I never participate in gossip about other family members (my family is quite drama-prone/gossipy...), and recently I’m hearing that my mother, grandmother, and one aunt are saying terrible things about me. Crazy stuff too. Like, that I accused other family members of arson (?! Oddly specific). Or that I married my husband only for his money (?! I worked before/saved, and I go to med school...when I graduate, I’ll be more than capable of supporting both of us!). I get there’s a lot of untreated mental illness in my family but...I mean really? I’m not even in the same city as everyone else/contact is pretty distant and pleasant on my end, so just...why? I mean, I do have one supportive aunt who I love to death...but that’s more or less all I have going on for “legitimate” family. Yet I elope, and all of a sudden everyone is up in arms because “weddings are for the family!” (quote-un-quote) and “clearly you didn’t care enough to have us there!”. Sigh. \\n\\nThat more or less applies to all my friends as well. I’ve always taken the “if you want to have a friend, you have to be a friend” quote to heart, and I really do try to be supportive and engaged in people’s lives. I thought I had made some good close friends in high school/undergrad - people who I thought actually knew me as a person somewhat. Especially my high school best-friend. When they moved elsewhere for university, I made every effort to make sure I was staying in touch...texting weekly to check in, calling them, making sure not to miss important dates/life events etc...and then one day they just stopped replying (yet were still talking to mutual friends/even visiting with them when they were in town). And deleted their social media (fair enough, I mean I get a “social media cleanse” as much as the next person). They have the same phone number as they did in undergrad (listed on their LinkedIn) and I text it every once in awhile (“hope life is treating you well - we should catch up sometime!” “Happy birthday!” “(Bob) told me you scored a job at (impressive company)- a huge congrats! They’re lucky to have you!”). I’ve been sending them e-birthday/Christmas gifts for years (small donations to charities they supported in their name). I don’t want to pester/harass people, so it’s not like these are inundating messages...just every once in awhile. I gave up this year. I have one true friend from junior high, and we keep in touch, but she lives far away and we don’t get to see each other often (when we do, it’s great!). I occasionally try to reach out to friends past via Facebook/ask about what’s going on for them, with highly variable responses...most recently, I reached out to a formerly close male friend to ask about his life, and he wanted to meet up for a “friendly catch up coffee”. And then tried to pressure me into a romantic relationship (despite knowing I’m married, and that the meeting was intended to be strictly platonic). It was uncomfortable, so I just sort of thew in the towel with Facebook. \\n\\nI have a lot of acquaintances at med school who I care about a lot. But that’s all they are - acquaintances. I could tell you lots about them (whenever I meet someone new I always try to find 1) something to remember about their appearance so I don’t forget them 2) something to remember about what’s going on in their lives so I can ask them about it next time we meet, and 3) something to genuinely compliment them on), but I doubt they could tell you anything about me. Because we never talk about that...no one ever asks me how I am, or what I’ve been up to. People I’ve known/seen daily for 2 years don’t even seem to know my name (as was recently revealed in one very awkward interaction).\\n\\nI try really, really hard. It’s been 2 years with this class, and so far no luck as far as making legitimate friends. I tried taking the bull by the horns and organizing a few social activities early into med (eg a hiking day out, a pumpkin carving/horror movies evening for Halloween) for people in one of our ongoing project groups, and while people showed up to the first one (and all sort of bonded with each other while I played hostess...I should have been more present in hindsight), out of 10 people who committed to the latter event only 3 showed up the day of (one for 15 minutes to say hi before heading out to another event, one to drop off snacks because they felt bad they couldn’t stick around, and the remaining one hung out for a bit then left within the hour). There was a lot of crying on my part later that night, and a ton of food gone to waste. No one said anything the next time we were all together (not that I acted dejected or anything, or brought it up). Just didn’t seem to matter to anyone (and clearly at least 3 people were aware that the event totally bombed for lack of attendance). Worse, more than half the group ended up coordinating to go on a holiday to Mexico later in the year. Turns out it was an opt-in thing, and everyone heard about it but me (“oh...I thought they told you...we’ll take pictures...”). I didn’t say anything about it but...I was (am) really hurt. I do everything I can to get people to like me. I smile and say “hi” to everyone I know in the halls. I volunteer to take notes when people are sick/away. I volunteer to coordinate meetings etc for our group (which isn’t fun, with like 10 people with conflicting schedules + busy preceptors). I share my summary notes/good resources I find on our class social media pages. I house and pet-sit for free (a bit of a touchy point for me right now...I’m currently missing school to stay at home with our critically ill pet, and asked these same people if they’d mind sharing their notes from a few upcoming non-recorded lectures with me. Not one person said yes). I even started bringing in baked goods for meetings etc...people seem to like the baked goods, but are pretty indifferent about me. I eat alone at lunch every day, usually holed up in an empty classroom somewhere, which is at least good for getting work done on my laptop. I used to try to casually join groups of people I know when they were eating/playing video games or whatever in the student lounge, but I was always a third wheel (not really included in the conversation, couldn’t really easily enter the conversation aside from playing the part of enthusiastic listener, etc. Literally people would make plans to meet up after class and check the availability of everyone but me, while I was standing right there awkwardly. It wasn’t even a “it’s implied you can join us” thing...more like a “alright I’ll call ahead and make table reservations for 7/8 of the people standing here, to finish the conversation 8/8 of us have been having for the last hour...”). I just gave up after awhile. It’s like people see right through me. Same goes for sitting with people in class...I don’t even bother anymore. Everyone has such clearly established “groups” they talk to and sit with (honestly it feels like high school all over again). I enter and exit lecture halls through the back doors so I don’t have to walk awkwardly up the aisle in front of everyone, desperately trying to make eye contact with someone who would invite me to join them. Because I inevitably end up sitting by myself in the very back row anyways. In the past I’ve tried striking up friendly conversation with people I know (when the lecture hall is just filling up) and eventually asking them if they want to join me...but they always have somewhere else to be/need to save seats for X many people. I don’t want to be paranoid, but...there’s a pattern. For awhile I became too anxious to even go to class, because it just feels like I’m someone no one wants around/a general inconvenience, and I’m embarrassed to go outside because I feel like something is deeply and inherently wrong with me. Going to class just makes me feel like a lesser person, not good enough to associate with everyone else.  \\n\\nAlright, so my family is dysfunctional (lots are), and my class is cliquey (as many are), old friends are too busy (reasonable), no big deal, says I. I’ll find friends elsewhere. So I join a free friend-finding app thing...looks like Tinder, but your profile is just about you and what sorts of things you might like to do with a friend (eg catch up over a coffee, go skiing, etc). I put so, so much effort into my profile. My husband and best friend (recall: the one who lives out of town) proof-read and approved it, because at this point I worry that I just don’t come across as normal/interesting. I was on it for months before I finally had some mutual responses (not for my lack of receptiveness). All of those have ghosted. Recently I made two contacts over the last few weeks (looks like a lot of people were joining over the holidays). One has seemingly ghosted, the other ghosted after one (what I thought had been really successful) meeting for coffee. The latter was so much worse, because we had been talking really frequently for 2 weeks and actually got into some relatively deep stuff (eg our rather compatible thoughts on politics, why we went into our professions, that her parents didn’t approve of her path in life etc), had met up for a few hours, and then all contact promptly ceased. Like, maybe I was ok enough on paper, but something was wrong with me in person? I’m super attentive to my hygiene, so I know I don’t smell or anything. I’m also super nervous about offending everyone, so my sense of humour is pretty mild and I’m not prone to discussing controversial stuff, or making unkind remarks...I just don’t get it. I tried my very best to ask her about lots of things going on in her life, because I’m taking “How to Win Friends and Influence People” to heart. I’m admittedly disproportionately devastated. I’ve sent a few “Hey, how goes life?” and “there’s some event going on at blablabla...want to join?” sort of follow-up messages since...she responded weeks later with “oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to meet up before my (3 month long) upcoming trip. We’ll have to wait until I get back”. Writing’s on the wall. \\n\\nI feel like I’m a good person. At least I really try to be. And that I could be likeable/interesting if people tried to get to know me. I really try to make people happy (maybe I’m too much of a people-pleaser?), I’m empathetic, and I’m flexible/open to trying new activities. I really do genuinely love getting to know people. I know I’m a bit socially awkward, but (at least according to my best friend) I come across as “really shy” vs “weird”. I’m not socially inappropriate, I’m positive, look happy, and I try to listen more than I talk. I volunteer with a crisis line and I’ve only ever gotten really good reviews for my interactions. My reviews from our standardized patients at school have always been good (“good rapport, clearly empathetic, a little shy but was a great listener...”), and my anonymous peer reviews at school too (perplexingly, I’m thought very likeable/empathetic according to those metrics, but not liked in person?). So while I know I’m a bit socially awkward, I don’t think I’m socially off-putting. I know I don’t share much about what’s going on in my life (I’m always afraid I’ll talk too much about myself/seem arrogant) so I probably come across as a bit boring/distant. But even if I’m boring, I don’t think I warrant being ghosted etc. I mean, it’s not like I’m exactly a volatile personality type either - I’ve never been one to let others know when I’m upset (eg even when everyone bailed on my party), because I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. I do know I’m quiet, and I do know I’m introverted/not the most outgoing...but I really do make efforts. I “get out there”. I have lots of passions and am in the community doing lots of things/engaging with fellow humans. There’s that saying that “if everything around you stinks, maybe it’s you” and I’ve taken it to heart. But when people have an anonymous means of communicating any social issues with you (peer or patient reviews) you’d think you’d hear about it. I’ve asked both my husband and my best friend to please tell me honestly if they think anything I’m doing/not doing is off-putting (to clarify, my friend is pretty brutally honest). They’ve both told me I’m really shy, but otherwise totally pleasant/normal. Maybe they’re just being kind? \\n\\nI just give up. I’m so lonely. I know that’s probably less justified than many on here because I have my husband, but it’s how I feel. I legitimately look forward to my psychiatry appointments (anxiety disorder) because aside from my husband and best friend, she’s pretty well the only person that knows the real me/actually wants to know about what’s going on in my life (though I appreciate that she’s paid to do that). And it’s not like I’m wholly alone, and I get that (my husband is my everything, I have my best friend who I text, my in-laws are nice to me)...somehow I just wish that I had a broader social group. Like, I love my husband more than life itself and I love coming home to him every day/having him near...but he’s the only social support I have in town. It might be nice to have a school friend. Or a gym friend. Or someone I could drag along for cheap pedicures. I dunno. He knows I’m lonely and encourages me to try the friend-finding app etc. Sometimes it feels like he’s the only one who has ever really loved me, and I am so grateful for him. I just wish I had some other people who cared about me too...friends at school or at my volunteer placements or what have you. I feel like if I were to drop dead today, the only people who’d be at my funeral would be my husband (and I guess in-laws), best friend, and one aunt. I’m like a mid-20s Eleanor Rigby. And I’m trying everything. \\n\\nIt’s all just frustrating, and deeply disillusioning. I’ve tried so hard, but I just give up. ', '30M Barista/Bartender anhedonia status I was talking to a coworker today and she was asking me what my middle name was, about my siblings, and all the other “get to know you” schpeal. The problem is that she’s asked me these same questions EVERY TIME WE WORK TOGETHER. She’s a confident young girl that sets her mind to her little goals and I really admire that about her. It’s truly inspiring, but I can tell that she clearly couldn’t give a singular f*** about me or what I’m saying and she just agrees to pass the conversation and be a lovable little person. Normally that’s fine, but at this time in my life I just can’t deal with it. I can’t deal with fake. I can’t deal with agreeability. I can’t deal with idle chit-chat. Being a barista that’s all we can really do sometimes because people don’t want to get into the nitty gritty of what’s really going on and nobody has the time for it. \\n\\nI’ve been feeling this deep pit of isolation and despair lately. Slipping into a state of anhedonia and I can’t seem to care about much at all these days. My relationships are dwindling. My dreams are padding further and further away as I get older. My energy levels are depleting. And I have no direction in life aside from “do what you want to do”. Well I don’t want to DO anything at all. I want to sleep and blow my mind on chainsmoking and video games or just laying in bed all day. I’m 30 years old and I’m having the cliche crisis where I’m looking at all the people I know with houses and kids and something to show for it all. Some idea of success and health and wealth and planning.  Im under all this pressure to grow and succeed and persevere and be the best Christian and be a strong man and be intelligent and wittier than the next guy and faster stronger more money more confidence and sexually competent and know all the answers and have a plan and be wise and be self controlled and listen to others advice and be an entrepreneur and look good and be handsome and get what I want and and and and and and. \\nI know these people are just as miserable as I am Im sure. But I know some of them aren’t and that’s what I want. Just to be a little better each day\\n\\nWell I don’t know what I want and that’s not ok. I don’t know where to go or what to do and that makes me an idiot. I don’t have goals aside from silly things like buying a nice car or a new music gadget and that makes me worthless. I don’t have the drive or energy to go to a gym because I spend all my time with people and need time alone but when I spend time alone it just makes me sad and lonely and that just makes me lazy. I sleep 12 hours a day when I’m not being a human placeholder for someone’s social thing or working one of my 3 jobs which makes me a tool. When I get home my roommate wants to chat about all of his problems and depressive issues. Then I finally go to my room to have some alone time and I have a nervous meltdown because I’ve been doing things all day and when I stop it’s like I stop “progressing”. I’m losing my damn mind and nobody knows how to put me back together again! \\n\\nFriendship:\\nI have a TON of friends. Any time of the day I could hit one up and drum up a hangout day of or whenever they’re free. The problem is: most of them don’t fit or aren’t more than a fair weather friend. I’m a fairly conservative Christian but I don’t let my beliefs get in the way of genuine human connection. But it’s hard when some of the people im around are in a completely different lane and can’t help me, though I can usually help them with some sound advice or some good deep conversation. We all have our beliefs and what do I care if we’re different, i like to help where I can. And no i can’t accept the “have you just tried smoking weed” comment. I’m already an escapist, the last thing I need is a deliberate substance that just makes me feel worse afterward. I can see that some of them hang out of pity. Sometimes they don’t know me and they spend a couple times together and decide that I’m not for them. My long time friends have me on a back burner or know that I don’t mind helping out with chores or errands so I’m usually along to help. The others are so wrapped up in their own stuff that they don’t seem to notice when I drop an “I’m dead inside so I can’t relate”. Or they ask how I’m doing “not so great” “oh well neither am I, let me tell you about how bad I’m doing instead”. I make a great shoulder to cry on but on one side I’m either getting barfed on or people don’t want to give up the real conversations so we just sit there making small talk about who has the best fast food burger or some dumb s***. I have some true blue homies, I really do. But sometimes it’s so lonely sitting in a room where it feels like one person is speaking Spanish and the other ones speaking French. When I finally get the floor to vent my frustration to anybody Im instantly interrupted or the phones come out and “uh huh. Uh huh”. I’ve been told numerous times to get connected to a church and join a small group but honestly; Christians are just as bad as everyone else and they can’t seem to wrap their minds around men having emotions and problems or they just simply don’t know what to do with me because on average their parents have been married their whole lives and they’ve never had to deal with someone that’s been through the dark like me. I’m too dirty for my church friends and too clean for my world friends. So I just show up to wherever I’m invited. Nod and agree and be a decent friend hoping the favor will someday be returned. \\n\\n\\nThe ladies:\\nI have an ex girlfriend that won’t leave me alone and every time I’m around her it’s always a massive burden because it’s always “Well just do this. You’re better than that. Well did you ask for more money. What are you doing wrong to make that happen.” She’s not attached to reality on top of it. As far as she knows, the sky is green and nobody can tell her otherwise and they’re trying to gaslight her. Every argument we’ve ever gotten into left me so confused and angry because she’s dodging things that she said one second that don’t make sense in this second. It makes a guy crazy! Just to give you some context: I once went to pay for our dinner. She pulled out her purse and offered to pay. She got distracted and never Opened her wallet so when she wasn’t paying attention I dropped a 20 on the bill. She looked back and said “oh ok I paid the bill” I said “no that was my cash, you never even opened your wallet cus you were talking” she argued with me that it was her 20 and that she remembered pulling it out and putting it down. Long story short, I was the bad guy and I was gaslighting her and making her feel mentally unstable. This is one of two girls interested in me. The other one is an abuse survivor that spends her whole day high out of her mind, chain smoking or drinking, and had a borderline eating disorder. She’s such a sweet wonderful girl and we’ve been friends for a long while now because we’ve been through some very similar things in life to make us the way we are. We hooked up recently (mostly her idea) and it completely sent me off the deep end. Is this all that’s here for me relationship wise? People that are either eating themselves alive or inadvertently eating me alive? I can’t date someone that’s going to constantly pressure me or someone with all the same bad habits I have just on 10. Is this all I can muster is someone that wants an open relationship with everyone I know or a girl that wants to gaslight herself and me and shred my ego to tiny pieces? Or just random hook ups where the girl just needed to use me to get over her last nasty breakup? \\nToday at the shop I had a girl come in that I’ve known for a while. We’ve interacted here and there as a customer barista acquaintance basis. We had a brief conversation and she leaves. Not even five minutes later she adds me on Facebook so I send her a “hey hello thanks for listening to me ramble before you left”\\nNo reply. \\nI had another friend hit me up. She was inviting me to her apartment at night and messaging me every day. and we were going on walks together. I brought her a Christmas gift and she started slow ghosting me so I let her go. Two weeks later she so graciously informs me that she’s dating someone even though relationship wasn’t even mentioned.  There was no honesty when I asked her If everything was alright. Before she hit me up she was dating a guy for a week and she wouldn’t talk about why it didn’t work out. Shoulda seen that coming. \\nHad another girl that would invite me over all hours of the night and let me MASSAGE HER BARE BACK AND LEGS. “I’m not interested in you like that”\\nOk sure. Maybe I keep getting lured and bY now i see the signs so everybody gets friendzoned. Well how about my choice?\\nEvery girl I approach is absolutely terrified of me and the ones that approach me are using me for emotional support after breakups or they’re completely off their rockers. Being a man, if I approach a girl I’m automatically the devil so I just gave up. \\nWomen flirt with me all the time at the shops where I work. So I oblige and casually flirt back and every time I’m met with some awkward tension. So I just stand like a deer in headlights when they flirt with me. And I know when a girls flirting and I know when it’s appropriate not to flirt. Is this a curse or some kind of lesson I should be learning? Like, go to a desert kid, nobody wants you so accept it and move on? Is it like this for everyone dating? Surely not cus everyone around me wants to eat the other barista guys up which is great for my predicament. Even my ex is hitting them up. Maybe I should just commit to the monk life and spend my days making beer and wishing I was dead. (The only difference now is that I drink the beer instead of making it)\\nAt this point I’ve just accepted that there’s nothing here for me and I try to be happy with that but then something ALWAYS comes along to trip me up. A temptress or a seemingly good interaction that goes sideways or a wack girlfriend. \\n\\nParents:\\nMy mom is a textbook narcissist and she needs to be taken care of as she is disabled. She inadvertently taught me how to hate women and not trust anyone because SHES my mom and SHE knows what’s best. I do my best not to let that get into my relationships but she’s all I had growing up so I have all of the problems that am emotionally unavailable mother would provide. She still manages to guilt trip me on occasion and call me out of the blue just to tell me that what I’m doing just isn’t good enough. I worked for her as a personal assistant because “she desperately needed my help and she couldn’t find anyone”. After years of saying no I finally caved. It got bad. I was under her thumb every day. She would call and ask where I was and what I was doing. How she wishes I could come clean instead of being home trying to catch up on sleep since I had two other jobs or having a night out where I was actually enjoying myself for once. Every day telling me about new jobs that I didn’t want because the one I work now just isn’t enough. And she’s right, but I have to make that decision and at the time it didn’t feel right to leave. Getting into arguments because i wouldn’t do what she said because “your dad taught you not to trust me”. I recently said to her that Im terrified of growing up to be a single loser with nothing to show for my life. She said “well you’re already grown up”. I got up and left right then and there. When I came back after a week of silence I told her how much it hurt me and she brushed it off like I was being too sensitive and that I misunderstood. My whole life she’s made me second guess every single thing I’ve ever done and then makes me feel terrible for not being able to make a decision and when I finally do that’s not good enough either. When I come to her at the point of breaking down and nearing suicidal behavior she just looks at me and says “well I have the same things you have and I had it worse than you did.”  I get the sentiment, I really do. But when it comes down to it, I don’t have a mom, I have a boundary pushing emotionally abusive wife. My parents have been split since I was 2 so in many ways the child always takes some of the roles of a husband (never sexually, google “emotional incest”) And of course; the narcissist can’t take blame. So I’ll come to her and talk about how she’s abusing her role, being rude or hurtful, or acting absurd and it becomes “well Im just a b**** I’m just a terrible person you hate me and all you want is for me to just drop dead. Don’t talk to me anymore I’m moving away you just don’t appreciate me and all I’ve done for you.” All of this on the tail end of me telling her that I needed to be home by 5. Well it’s 6:20 snd she wants to stop at another place and she can’t just let me go. So I called her out on it. We ended up back at her house with her sitting in the car refusing to get out and crying talking about all she’s done and yada yada. Right now she has a friend of mine as her PA. The last two times I called her she’s been short and only talks about the new PA girl. They both have a wonderful time bashing men and me I’m sure. I haven’t heard from mom in about 4 days when it used to be every day or other day. Seems quaint. Some days I wish I had the balls to either disappear or end my life just to show her up. But that’s just the petty side of my brain acting up. \\n\\nDad:\\nWas an 18 year old child when I was born. And in many ways he still is an 18 year old child. He calls me to ramble about whatever he rambles about.  Imagine a circle that keeps breaking off into another circle and eventually becomes a fractal of rambling that just makes your head swim. After talking to him I feel like I need to cry in the shower because reality is just so distorted. He’s moved on to three new families in my life and never seemed to have time to pick me up because he was working two jobs to pay for an extravagant truck or whatever house was in whatever girls name that he was with at the time. All of these women havent been the biggest fans of me to boot. I don’t know exactly what to believe because both mom and dads realities were distorted about the divorce. They both had to work day and night to support themselves and me and all the lawyers. Eventually when the smoke settled Im left with a dad that’s more of a weird uncle. He’s been married to his current girl for about 6 years and Im just now getting invited to Christmas functions. Pretty inclusive wouldn’t you say? At some point I was molested and was showing signs of it and custody had to be taken away. But it seems like a good reason to hide behind when he had a new girlfriend (who was also abusing me) and he needed to work to impress her. These days when i talk to him, in the midst of a mental breakdown and I’m nearing suicidal actions, it just turns into a ramble session wherein He needs My approval. He called me the other night to ask advice on his marriage after an argument about his yard care regimen. Meanwhile I’m calling counselors left and right to try and get in to talk to someone after I drove home drunk trying to feel something. \\n\\nWork:\\nI’ve been a barista for about 5 years now. I was passed up for a roasting position and the owners posted a management position. I walked Into the office and said “when do I start”. They said that they needed to figure out who was interested and that they’d get back with me. Turns out it was a ploy to keep the three people that put their two weeks in. I eventually quit and immediately the position was given to the kid that was given the roasting position to spite me. The same kid that comes to work high every day and sits on his phone when I worked my ASS off in that place day and night. We were doing some maintenance on the shop and I had a chance to talk to one of the owners at length and she offered me a beer. “Assuming you’re of age of course” I laughed thinking it was a joke. Then later she says “how old are you again? 30?! I thought you were a baby, like 21 years old!!!” What. You would have hired me when I was 16 and bought me whiskey that same year at a bar. After I literally destroyed myself for you people you don’t even know how old I am and you gave both of the positions that I would have thrived in to this kid that’s in it for the free p*****. I hate to be that way. I always try to be humble almost to the point of giving my life to others. But you’ve got to be kidding me. The other job that I work is bartending at a restaurant. The people say day in and day out “you’re the best, you’re the real mvp, we love tou”  But I don’t get invited out with the group when they go out. I know how to do all the front end jobs in the restaurant and through the week I get no serving shifts. Just bartending which at a restaurant like this one, makes 20-50% less than the servers. And then when I do get week shifts, I work as a host. They get even less. I’ve asked for serving shifts and of course I bust my ass wherever I go, but still I get the shaft. \\nAm I the best? Or are you just saying that to get me to stay in the trench. \\n\\nSo in conclusion my life has shown me that you don’t get anywhere by working hard. Being a hard worker separates you from everyone else. Everyone is a hologram. Dating is a funny game we play and the churn is never in your favor. Your parents most likely literally can’t love you and friendships are all out of convenience. There’s no counseling that can take you and even if there was, they’re not listening. Everyone is just so maladjusted and insane that it’s hard not to feel lonely even with your family or a crowd of friends or in a stadium of people that came to see you. \\n\\nHow the hell does anyone do it?', \"Don't know anymore I've been in debt since finishing college and starting work. Debt started 6 months into getting out of college at 18 (I'm now 24), starting work and moving out. I come from a background where we never really had much money, so me seeing these large sums coming in thought I was rich, was spending where I really shouldn't have and couldn't afford to. Of course this added up very quickly. So I needed a way to pay rent. Being the big clever person that I was, I took out one of those fantastic pay day loans that were so freely available. It was great. Things were sorted again. But then the next month rolled by, and I thought shit I need even more money now that doesn't exist. Any way this spiraled for about a year and half, where I was trying to be cleaver and use multiple loans to pay each other off, this didn't work because smart me was still going out ever night to get drunk and have a laugh. I think in total by the time all companies refused me loans I was a grand total of 9k in debt. Doesn't sound too bad in the scheme of things, but it got me really down.\\n\\nSo I bucked up, got my self a debt management plan. Where I pay a small per cent to a company to collate all my debts and give me one affordable pay back plan. - this is the step above declaring bankruptcy - essentially worked out I had about £150 a month for food and fuel for my motorbike. Ace. But it was to fix my own problems. It took about two years to sort that out and finish paying it back. Excellent. During that time period I had to move out of one flat due to damage caused by the other remnant, who also liked to not pay his share of bills and rent on time, leading to one terrible reference for future endeavours. The flat was absolutely ruined, and with all my money problems I was pulling my hair out with stress. Not really being able to see the light at the end. But I managed to get a not so on the books flat - which wound up being awful. \\n\\nSo new flat, debt plan almost finished. Living on my own. The land lord also lived next door to the property. I worked as a retail manager doing shifts starting at 5am and finishing at 3pm or starting at 2pm and finishing at 11.30. Exceptionally antisocial on a mixed rota, so no week was ever the same. Isolated by work, isolated by how far away I was from everyone I knew. Things got worse. All the while I'm losing that spark I had, the thing I'd say made me, me. Just declining. I found video games in a big way, I could connect with an old college friend and play games into the night. I'd finish work at half 11 be home by half 12 and playing video games with him until 7-8 in the morning. When I was on early shifts I'd be up all night right up to the point of needing to leave to get to work. Now I have an extreme problem sleeping and to worsen it, the entire time I was drinking away. More booze, constantly. So this went on for about a year. Going out to see people maybe once every month or two for social interaction (heavy drinking at clubs). \\n\\nAn old love interest approaches. After splitting up with a long term partner. Invite her round. Things happen. Feelings then happen. But she's in a bad place. Also has mild mental health disorder. Anyway after this happening a few times I relay my interest for wanting something more. Gets shot down. Then gets picked back up. Rolls on for a while. She goes back to the city she's living in. Hooks up with other people after leaving me not knowing what her answer was. - almost rubs it in my face, but I was too blind. Constantly on the phone to each other, while I pick up all the emotional baggage she's off hooking up with other people (more fool me) anyway I go to visit as she's in a very bad way (suicidal) then she expresses interest. After a week or so decides that she wants us to get together. Fucking A! This is good. Go me. Traveling back and forth for a while, literally every free chance I had I was traveling to her, absolutely besotted and in love maybe somewhat blind. One trip while I was away the plastic pipes in my fantastic flat burst. On my return all my possessions have been flipped and thrown out of the way - actual damage to my things not from water but from the landlord throwing them. Any way landlord blames me. Levy's a fine of £1500 for damage not caused by me. Anyway I agree to pay with no intention of doing so. The flat I lived in was not legal. So about a week later and a lot of stress working out what I'm going to do, where I'm going to stay to sort things out (thank god for brothers!) In the dead of the night I moved all my shit out and let it go. Mild harassment but he knew there was nothing he could do so it stopped.\\n\\nFinancially I should now be in the best position I ever have. Brother not charging rent. Nothing to pay out other than phone bill (quick note I forgot to mention during debt loan period I had a crash on my motorbike, which was the cars fault, rendering me bike-less. This took two years to resolve and went 50-50 -bullshit. I was cycling 14 miles to work and back each day until I moved to bros, who lived round the corner from my work). But I was still coming up short every single month because of traveling and helping partner to afford her rent and bills. Paying for us both to go out when I was there. Pouring everything I had emotionally and monetary into this person. Who sometimes just wanted to talk to me about how upset she was about her breakup and for months this is all she wanted to really talk about.\\n\\nSo staying at brothers, started making plans to move in with gaming friend! Great idea. But then a new idea is thrown in. Cut the gap move in with gf, move city leave EVERYONE behind. I don't know what my brain was thinking when I said yes. So made the move which was a whole lot more stress. But this had benefits there's two of us. I could step down and have more free time from work. This worked out for about 1 month. Then realised I need to get promoted again, within a different company as the first one wouldn't transfer me. So I'm still broke scrapping pennies. Again I realise this and don't want the same problems as before. I'm paying her share of the bills. So I bite the bullet and go for promotion back to same old bullshit I wanted out of for so long. - again due to my own failings I'm not very qualified to do any other job. I just can't get my foot in anything else. Decent gcse results but shocking a -level. \\n\\nTime goes on. I'm still paying her bills. She's getting depressed we have consistent arguments where she's having a go at me for being at work...I have no social life. I work all day and use all my money to keep us with a roof and with food. Anyway this bill money she doesn't ever have is going on alcohol while she's out with her friends...this gets so bad that she loses her job now....but when receiving final pay...still spends it all on going out and blames it on her depression. Which I believe I've seen her just break down over nothing before - she has bpd - anyway...currently trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I can't afford to pay for all rent all bills and feed us. She finds out that she's getting Birthday money soon and instantly starts talking about things she wants to buy and do when she gets it. Doesn't even consider the fact that WE need it to survive. In the past month or so she's been out all the time, started going out drinking with her ex. And I'm left at home being the only one that's suffering. So she goes home for a week, because she doesn't want to have to worry about where he next meal is coming from. Using the last money she had. Which coincidentally was the last money either of us had. Leaving me for a week with no real food...and not a penny to my name. Thanks. She's been back 2 days. Day 1 drinking in flat with guy who is ex heroin addict. Day 2 wankered with female friend passed out in spare room and in living room with ex. Both days I've been out slugging away at work.\\n\\nI've never felt as isolated as I do right this moment. It's 3 am and I just don't want to go to bed. It's been 6 years and I'm just as broke as ever. Loads of hefty bill letters about to come through. Pay day in a few days. Yet the whole lot is going the second it comes in. Phones about to be cut off because I've prioritised the other bills over this one. I don't really know what to do. Things aren't always awful. We have really really good times. But it's just getting to much I think. The biggest mistake I made was moving city. I don't regret getting with her or being with her. Though it feels it's coming to an end- over time the thing we forgive become too often and I don't want to always be forgiving someone. I should have never moved away. I took far to much for granted when I was 18. I paid for my mistakes. I've not had any social interaction outside of work for about 6 months now. I have no real contact even online with anyone. And the worst thing is I'm absolutely terrified that if I talk to her about all this she will do something stupid. If I tell her I want to move back to my old city to be closer to friends (if they'll still want to be around me after I left them and have had little to no contact for almost a year.) Or that I want to end things (mind I've not made that decision yet) that then I will have the fact that she will potentially try to commit suicide...she does have suicidal thoughts almost daily. Mood is up and down like a yo yo. And I've been trying so hard to keep her happy and level and to keep myself happy. But I'm breaking. I'm so so alone. And I don't even feel like I can turn to anyone because I fucked off and ditched everybody. Sometimes she's says things and doesn't even realise the harshness of it. It's hot her fault but it happens. I feel like I'm nothing. I feel so worthless. And have done for a long time. - there's one good thing. I've not had an alcoholic drink in at least 6 months. \\n\\nI think I needed to just vent this out. Apologies for the length, thank you for reading if you have. It just needed to come out. I've probably not done justice what I'm feeling or the full stories. I just don't know where I'm at. I almost feel on auto pilot. Just doing stuff for the sake of it. And it's been this way for years. The most alive I've felt since college was while traveling from city to city. It gave me purpose. Now my only purpose is bills, for someone else...\\n\\nTldr; I'm lonely. A lot of back story. \", 'I have never felt this much despair I regret what I chose to study in college, I’m struggling to get a job, I’ve never felt this misery my whole life, I can’t even sleep cause I’ll dream this depressing dream about me being young and having all of life a head of me, I’m so lost, afraid of failure and yet so tired to fight it, I want to die, I don’t want to live', \"Feelings of loneliness turned into despair I've definitely experienced years of depression, I'm only 23 years old. Growing up, I moved a ton, which fostered inner feelings of instability. I moved from Canada to the states right before high school in a town that was predominantly white. I, myself, am Asian and felt the pressure to fit in which led me to become someone who was not my true self. It was wrong in hindsight, but it felt more like a survival mechanism for me. I strung through a series of toxic relationships with guys and have a history of feeling abandoned by both men and best friends. This cracked me. I've had friends where i did everything for them and was the best friend they could ever ask for turn on me and completely betray me. In all, I still feel like I don't understand why I keep feeling misunderstood, can't maintain meaningful friendships with other people, and when i do, I end up getting screwed over by others. Currently, I would say I don't have a best friend other than my boyfriend who lives 500 miles away. I graduated from university and moved back with my parents where I went to high school and absolutely hate the town. I KNOW this place isn't for me but I got a job here and financially it's the best decision for right now. I feel like I have no friends at home and am struggling to maintain those I have back in the city where I went to university. Sometimes, I wonder what it really is about me that makes it so hard for me to be able to form meaningful friendships with others. \\n\\nI would say that I'm pretty attractive, I have a job in ophthalmic research, and my motto in life is to be nice to everyone you meet because you never know what kind of a struggle others are facing.

All my classmates liked me and as far as I know no one had a problem with me. Junior high came along and everything changed. I had a strong sense of style and my music...Let’s say it wasn’t everybodys favorite. I became an easy target for bullying and my life went downhill from there. Even the people I thought was my friends started ignoring me. I felt invisible. \\n\\nThis made me very upset and I felt like I had no option but to move away. I moved to the other side of my country at the age of 16 and I loved it there. I found a couple of good friends and I finally I felt like someone accepted me for who I am. Years went by and it was time for us to study. My friends got into universities in another city and I was yet again left alone. Confused about my future and all my options I decided I wasn’t ready to study so I worked instead. \\n\\nI had a horrible breakup with my high school sweetheart and had to move back to my parents again in my hometown. It was my worst nightmare going back there. I sucked it up and knocked on my dad’s door. He let me stay for a couple of months but I was too overwhelmed and almost felt choked by the thought of running into old classmates. \\n\\nI started drinking to forget where I was. I wasn’t sober a single day for those two months and I don’t think anyone knew. One of the nights I decided to go out. I had a great time with a bunch of strangers until someone from my junior high approached me. \\n\\nI was a little startled but mostly confused because of some medical issues I’ve had that makes me forget about things. And with that I fogot a lot of the people I used to know. Being an open person I tried explaining to them what happened to me. They straight up thought I was lying and one of them even run away in the middle of me trying to explain. The rest of them acted like they actually cared and was worried about me. One of them said to me that they would like to meet up another day and told me to message them on FB. This made me really happy as I’ve been thinking for years that everybody hated me. I texted this person the next day and they never replied to me. \\n\\nOnce again I felt like I didn’t belong there so I had to get away. I moved a few hours away. This is a large city and I thought I had a good chance to start over. I got a new job and made good friends. Unfortunately this workplace turned out to be bad and people quit after a while. I can’t find a new job because of Corona and now I’m stuck at this bad place. Recently I found out that the person who ghosted me in the other town lives here too. This person works at my nearest grocery store. I’ve had to meet this person multiple times after the incidence and It’s the most awkward thing I’ve ever experienced. I can’t handle fake people and this person straight up is one. \\n\\nNow I’m here struggeling to fit in. I’m very suicidal and have tried to get new hobbies to think of other things. I also struggle with social things and I’m very socially awkward due to being alone for years. I’m in a committed relationship but we can’t just up and move because of his work. I’d like to move back to the city I lived in at the other side of my country. \\n\\nSorry I don’t really know why I’m doing this. I created Reddit because I’m lonely and even here people seem to not like me. I’m lost and don’t know what to do. I’m constandly sad all the time and often try to ‘stalk’ my old friends and they all seem to have a perfectly good life. \\n\\n• Does anyone feel the same way as me?\\n\\n• How can I stop being so damn awkward meeting new people? They seem to head out pretty fast.\\n\\n• How do you make friends?', \"So it was my 30th yesterday... The work week leading up to it was just pure despair. My colleagues at work that knew about it were all asking about what I was going to do for it, and I had come up with a half-baked pseudo believable story about visiting friends in another town but I actually had no plans whatsoever and just drank alone at home waiting for it to go by. The fact that I will have to carry on this lie next week just causes my stomach to sink.\\n\\nOn paper, I have a good professional life, everything one would aspire to have. College educated, STEM degree at a top university leading to a high earning job but I am left feeling so hollow - is this all to life? A day job followed by waiting around for the next day to begin to repeat ad infinitum. I feel that I can't complain, a lot of other people are in a far worse position than I, what right do I have to complain about something like this?\\n\\nHowever, looking personally, I have failed at life. I don't have any friends, I've never been in a relationship before, never had sex, never even kissed or held hands with a woman, never done a lot of the things that I've wanted to do. I was always so focussed on my work and achieving what I perceived was success in life that I actually just let life pass me by without a second thought. The things that I always thought would just happen by osmosis never did and I deeply regret that.\\n\\nI've only really started thinking about my life up until this point as my 30th approached and I just don't feel fulfilled in what I have achieved. I want to experience love, I want to have friends, I want to have a fulfilling social life. I can't do anything about the past but I can do things going forwards in my life.\\n\\nI know what I need to do to improve myself, I just wish I had realized sooner that these things don't come for free. You actively have to work at it and having it take up to this point in my life to realize makes me immeasurably sad at having wasted so much time.\\n\\nI'm not sure why I'm posting this other than vent into the open void of an anonymous reddit forum. I just wish I had realized sooner...\", 'I’ve been feeling miserable lately I’m kind of new to reddit and stuff since I barley use it, but I wanna vent here and say that life has been miserable and lonely for me so far. Everyday I find myself getting in despair because of how lonely I am for most of the times.I am mostly left alone with my thoughts talking to me. I turned 17 this year and wanted a cat for my birthday to fill in the hole of sadness I feel in a daily. Of course I never ended up getting one and I’m still suffering from lack of interaction, most of the time it seems like the people I want to hang out with aren’t interested in being around me. Every time I go to the bathroom I look in the mirror and always find myself looking so dead inside.

Instead, I started to do as my literary hero, The Count of Monte Cristo, did. I started to use my prison as a school. My goal was to eliminate any possible thing that was keeping me from finding someone. I lost 150 pounds. I worked on my career and pulled myself out of a dead-end job. I\\'m studying for entrance exams to finally get my degree. Most of all, I have studied fashion, grooming, etc. All I could wear was circus tents before I lost the weight, but that\\'s changed.\\n\\nHas any of this helped? Not yet. Obviously I\\'m far from finished. The goal of the challenge is to be the most magnificent beast I can be. If I can look at myself satisfied that I\\'ve done all that I possibly can to better myself, and that\\'s still not enough, then to hell with whatever cosmic chance or god or simulation spawned me. I will go to my grave confident that I played every card I was dealt and cheated when I ran out of those.\\n\\nThe reason I shared this is because I know a lot of you guys probably are sick of getting petty advice from happy people who were showered with love and did absolutely nothing to earn it or deserve it.

Wow. \\n\\nWhen I step outside during a summer day, it can remind me of my childhood. The breeze blows across my face and I\\'m reminded of how I used to look forward to school because each month that passed was a new season, holidays that come up, summer vacation, a new grade level, new friends, activities at school, all in culmination of going to college. Even hearing that it\\'s back to school season brings me to memories of when I was a little kid and maybe things really were OK. But now, my parents are so toxic I can\\'t even talk to them anymore. I want to get a graduate degree but I don\\'t know in what as the months keep passing and I keep working. \\n\\nI\\'ve been trying therapy for the last few years -- been in it long-term the last year.

All of it was just bad news to my difficulty having friends. I get to deal with never having a girlfriend too.

Try to remember to cook even though I hate it so I can eat a bit healthier. \\n\\nI\\'m hitting most of my tasks, but they feel empty. I can\\'t talk about \"real\" topics with new friends because it\\'ll scare them away or I\\'ll embarrass myself. I can\\'t express myself to people because it just comes out angry or then I feel bad for sharing because I feel I put something negative on them. \\n\\nI\\'ve been volunteering many times too, I usually give without expecting anything but even then it\\'s just something I did.

', 'The reason depressed, suicidal or lonely people don’t get help is NOT because of the stigma against depression. It’s because nobody gives a fuck about their problems Every time a person who is depressed or lonely tries to get help, people trivialize their problems and gaslight them and teach them comforting lies and false hope, only for us to realize in the end they lied. \\n\\nEvery time we talk to someone, they minimize our problems. You are 30 and never had a gf/bf and never could date or lose your virginity. They say “tHeRe’S mOrE tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd dAtInG” and these are the people who get depressed over a breakup or who won’t date a virgin because they cannot handle teaching you or who get dates regularly and don’t know what it’s like in your shoes\\n\\nYou tell them you never made friends and are socially isolated and others have pics of them doing fun stuff online they say “but but those are just the highlights” even though their highlights are far more exciting than anything that occurs in your life and then they say “BuT yOu dOn’T kNoW wHaT gOeS oN iN tHeIr LiFe hOw Do yOu kNoW ThEy’Re hApPy?” And how do you know they’re just as miserable? Some might be miserable but a majority I’m sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.\\n\\nThey tell us that friends, social events etc aren’t that fun and we aren’t missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn’t go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn’t so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren’t fun why do people go to them all the time? \\n\\nInstead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.\\n\\nThese are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems \\n\\nThis is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don’t get help. Even if they knew you won’t stigmatize them for being depressed they still won’t talk to you knowing you’ll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. \\n\\nThis is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people “trying” to prevent suicide/depression.', 'I’m so lonely it’s making my suicidal ideation worse .

Me and M aren\\'t friends in the slightest, when we talk is straight to the point communicating about need for house appliances or concerns about something in the apartment (es. Mold creeping up from behind the kitchen counter). \\n\\n\\nG and I don\\'t get along very well, and usually it results with G and M coupling against me for whatever reason G could find to blame me and F not taking part in the conflict (between the 3 of them F is the one I have the best relationship with). For example a pan got slightly redder in colour and G asked me if I knew anything about it in an inquisitory tone, as if she already decided I was the culprit, and even when F admitted she burned some bread on it G kept talking and behaving as if I burned the pan.\\n\\n\\nThis is just an example that happened 2 weeks ago, but there are other instances, another would ve when she didn\\'t want me to use the kettle (mind you, that\\'s mine, they obviously can use it without asking, but still it\\'s mine) because I was \"sick\" (just a sore throat), this was 1 week ago. Or today when she asked me if \"I was done eating\" when I was having lunch (like, wtf, what\\'s even her point), it\\'s not like I was even occupying all the table or all the pans and pots, I already washed everything but the plate I was eating from.\\n\\n\\nBoth F and I are very shy, so we don\\'t talk much even when we\\'re alone in the apartment (luckily it\\'s usually us two when it\\'s just me and another flatmate). Sometime I text her, asking how her day went and so on, while she answer, sometimes enthusiastically, she never initiates conversation. To her credit though sometimes she invites me when the 3 of them organise something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow there\\'s another group of \"friends\": 2 guys (1 cis, A, and 1 trans, S) and 1 girl (L). S and L live together, while A lives in a structure made for students, since he lives near S\\'s university they usually hang out together.\\n\\n\\nWe had a vacation planned for this summer, going to Spain by car (we are from Italy), but it was postponed due to L\\'s dad not feeling well and sge wanted to stay with him, which would be understandable if she didn\\'t go 1 week to Paris with another group of friends and 1 week to another city in Italy (I won\\'t mention it because it\\'s where her GF lives, so privacy). She decided to postpone it before organising those things. It was than postponed again (this time indefinitely) when we should have gone in the first week of October.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure summer 2024 S, L and A are going to re-propose the Spain trip but I don\\'t know if I want to commit to it seeing it was already delayed two times. Also since Spain was chosen because L was graduating and it was our gift to her, and she kinda \"burned it\", and this year I\\'m the one that\\'s gonna graduate (Bachelor\\'s degree in physics) I\\'d rather something like Greece, and I\\'m even open to going alone, however I don\\'t know how to tell my parents because they\\'ll be upset if I go alone.\\n\\n\\nI asked S and L if we could hang out because I needed to vent about stuff that happened in the flat with G and M (those 2 things mentioned earlier and others). Initially S ghosted me from Wednesday to Sunday, than Monday messaged me saying she didn\\'t saw our chat because she had a lot of messages and it fell down on the WhatsApp log and that she was sorry. So we scheduled for this Thursday evening (today). I should have gone to theirs for dinner and stay the night.\\n\\n\\nHowever L sent me a voice note saying that others friends asked them for Thursday evening so they would be free from 11 pm after dinner. This made me angry and very sad, because a lot of times when I asked to hang out they said they had other plans, but now that I was the first to ask I still got put as second and not first in the priority list. In the end we didn\\'t hang out at all.\\n\\n\\nPartially my fault because considering the distance that I would have to travel by bike and weather (~15 minutes in rain and 12° C) it was undoable without risking some serious fever, so I called out. But I still feel like they should have put our hangout first because I asked first, and those friends of theirs after. They also said that \"they were there if I needed them\" but it certainly doesn\\'t feel like it given the circumstances.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m also the only one of the group to not have ever had a lover and still a virgin. And things aren\\'t looking good on that side: tinder is kinda impossible with an alt guy profile, and I don\\'t know where I could meet new people.\\n\\n\\n\\n(TLDR, kinda) So in the end my flat is an hostile environment (neutral at best) and my other \"friends\" always consider me as second or third or worse option.

Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.  A broke kid who got a 1570 on his SAT but could only manage to get a 2.1 in college and on the verge of losing everything I’ve worked towards my entire life, lonely and losing the one thing that made me happy.  I don’t really care if anyone reads this or not but I had to get all my feelings out because everyday I wake up and just cry.  Physically I feel awful, I’m lonely, I feel like a failure, and nobody is here for me to even talk to.', \"tw suicide, mention of drug abuse & self harm ever since i started living in a different city for uni i have been feeling so suicidal and i have been thinking of starting drug usage or smoking/alcohol, the second day on campus i relapsed in self harm, i have a shy personality i don't attract people for even basic things like starting conversations it's really hard for me to make friends but two months into uni i have made two or three but i barely trust any... my bpd makes it so hard for me to keep up with friendships i want to numb this pain & i feel that consuming drugs or alcohol will help but i don't want to fall in this shithole\", \"Suicidal Urges and Jealousy I can't believe it. I had urges to take my own life again even though I previously promised myself not to. After a lot of pain and suffering for a few hours, I was lucky enough to fend off the urges. Lately The Quarantine thing has been making my life even worse. Even though I always feel lonely and depressed everyday, I  could at least distract myself by going to college, or cooking. Now both of those activities are hindered.  Online class is never the same for me, and I do not have access to most of the ingredients I need to cook. The result is my depression, sadness and loneliness taking over. Every day when I wake up, I feel like I just want to sleep the whole day because I dont want to suffer through my lonely and shitty life. I don't have a lot of friends who care about me, and most of them have either betrayed  me or have left me. Sometimes I think that I'm the one responsible for them leaving me even though I know that they are toxic to me. The worst contribution to my depression has got to be jealousy and stuff relating to love life and relationships. For starters, I was never the funny,cool or the social and popular type like my cousins who are respected by everyone. I always want to be just like them but i don't think I can. Love has not treated me well either, I never had a gf before and I have always wanted one. Even after improving myself so much, dressing better and losing almost half my weight, improving my personality and socializing skills,  studying hard to be accepted in a good college, and even learning to cook and got really good at it. Even after everything I have done over the years, I still get rejected.  I have lost count at this point how many times. As  a result of this, I am constantly made fun off by my peers due to being a frustrated virgin loser. My parents keep asking me why I am still single as well. All of this has turned me bitter and really jealous of everyone in relationships, my peers taking advantage of this and showing off their happy relationships to make me feel worse. Every time I  even think,see or hear about relationships, couples, or love in general I automatically feel like I want to end my life which is made even worse when it keeps being shoved in my face everywhere I go.  I feel like I will end up dying alone.\", \"Lonely and scared guy having suicidal thoughts, need help I don't expect many people to read all this, but anyways. \\n\\nSo I'm 18 years old, male, British, going to university in September - it's just under a month now. \\n\\nAt the moment, I'm at home (it's the middle of the night, still awake of course). This weekend I didn't do anything but play games  and watch sport on TV  and  I'm going to do the same for the whole of the next week,  and probably the week after. I probably won't leave the house at any point. \\n\\nOne of the reasons I don't ever leave the house is because I don't have any friends. I haven't for two years,  when my only two friends both changed schools. I only stayed in touch with one of them, and maybe text him once or twice a month about something I'm not sure he really cares about. He's the only contact on my phone that isn't an immediate family member. It goes without saying I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend either. \\n\\nRecently I started having suicidal thoughts (not for the first time, but the first time I really rationalised it as a good idea). When I'm watching TV or playing something (by myself of course) I nornally don't worry, but if I start to think about it I can't get the thoughts out of my head.\\n\\nI'm just scared. I worry that when I go to uni I won't be able to make any friends and won't fit in. I feel uncomfortable in any remotely social situation - if I go outside and see a stranger who may or may not be looking towards me I start to sweat heavily and feel anxious or nervous.\\n\\n I don't see how I can bond with other people.  I feel like a small child sometimes, because I'm so uncomfortable in any situation and I can't do basic things because of it. I wouldn't be able to order food or drink at a restaurant, cafe or bar, I couldn't even have the self confidence to get a coffee. Once I wanted to go to the cinema to see a film but I was anxious about how to book it, how would I get the tickets, how would I explain to my parents where I was going. I didn't go. \\n\\nI tie my laces in a different way to most people because no one ever taught me how to do it the normal way and so I've done it in a more simple way for years. The normal way is too complicated for me to learn without feeling embarrassed.\\n\\nWith my parents I feel like I have to justify every single thing I do. I know that if I did something as simple as sweeping my hair to one side with my hand my dad would make a snarky remark about it and I wouldn't be able to deal with it. Meanwhile people of my age have been getting mad haircuts and colouring their hair for years, while I can't even get an appointment at the barbers myself because I don't want to let on to my dad that I even slightly care about my hair. Of course I don't buy clothes either, my mum just buys some occasionally and the only thing I have the confidence to do is to tell her to buy what's cheapest because I don't care. But I do care.\\n\\nNow I'm looking at a Facebook group chat that my uni has set up for people living in halls (it's me and the 4 people who will be my flatmates). I've never used Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram before but these guys are discussing their other social media, and they're talking about going to music festivals and parties and other events that they're going to or have already been to (with their friends). I don't have the confidence to even say a word in a facebook chat because I feel like such an outcast, and i can't relate to anything they say.\\n\\n I've never had a drink of alcohol and the thought of doing so makes me nervous. I've not done a driving test and I can't think of anything more terrifying. I've never been to a gym (and my muscles are almost nonexistent), I would feel so uncomfortable in a gym environment. I've not had a job of any kind, don't know how I would get one and I don't think I would be good at it at all regardless of what job it could be . I feel like there's five or ten years of difference in terms of maturity between them and me.\\n\\nWhen I think about the future I worry, because I know that unless I sort my problems I will probably be alone for a lot longer than I want (I don't want to say forever) . And the course I'm doing at uni is sport related. That means two things: I fear about employment opportunities since it's quite niche, and it means that sport could become work at which point I don't know what I would have to enjoy.\\n \\nI kind of just want to be normal, but I don't know what to do. Any help would be appreciated.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, can't believe the number of responses. Thanks to everyone who's commented, I'll try to digest it all and reply to you all. Thanks so much\", \"Feeling like suicide is just an inevitable solution. My life looks damaged beyond repair.

So I have a long history of panic disorder, social anxiety, and depression. It was so bad in my PhD program that after I finished everything other than my dissertation, I isolated myself totally, became extremely depressed, and was bed bound for about 1.5 years, only leaving to avoid humiliation by having to ask someone to cover a tutorial for undergrads, and for a medical leave. I ended up going back to the program after the leave, still unable to function, and so I decided to drop out then as making up for the lost time was totally impossible. \\n\\nPart of my problem these days is that while my anxiety and depression are better due to better medications and so on, I never learned how to do simple things like asking someone for her number, or what not. I do not have any friends locally that I can see, and I have never been in any kind of relationship as well, both facts which make me very lonely. Additionally, I was laid off in January, and the industry completely collapsed and so I’m fucked without a job even now, living off of EI. \\n\\nTo try to prevent myself from getting incredibly depressed again, and unable to even attempt social interaction, I have been regularly going to a local coffee shop to appplh for jobs on my iPad, and listen to music. \\n\\nThere is a lovely barista there who usually is the only person on, and she seemed interested in me for quite some time. She has a smile that cheers you up quite a bit, although it leads to immediate anxiety. I do have medication that I could take, however this is the situation…..\\n\\n2-3 months ago, I got drunk at home and wrote a positive review of the shop. I said that it was a great place to go and indulge in “that youthful bean,” and that I had an “embarrassing crush” on the barista. I deleted that 30 seconds after I posted it, but lo and behold she of course saw it. I went back about a week later, and she smiled the whole time and kept asking me if there was anything else I’d like, even after I paid. Of course I did not ask for her number ect… anyways, that was 2 months ago, and as she didn’t seem uncomfortable or anything, I kept going. \\n\\nBlah blah blah, recently someone else who worked there asked her if she likes me. She said “he’s cute,” and also said that I am “very shy,” which is very obvious… I heard this because I was at the table immediately around the corner. Anyways, I don’t know if I could ask her for her number or if that would be obnoxious, and if I could, if I could just do it with a note and get the hell out of dodge and don’t not come back unless she chooses to text me, but I simply don’t have a clue how to proceed or if I even should. \\n\\nAll this bs has taken a lot from my life, and I really just need something good at the moment.

Some days even that feels overwhelming.   \\n\\n\\nToday especially has been rough, I don't know why. I just get days like this occasionally. Constant brewing feeling of impending doom throughout the day, my thoughts reminding me of how I've wasted my time, and continue to, yet getting up to do anything useful seems so overwhelming, despite really wanting to. I'm dying to have some more eventful inputs in my days. Hell, I'm dying to even be able to speak vocally, more than I do currently. I'm dying to be able to have more genuine friends, especially within a distance that doesn't require a plane ticket to hang out in person.  \\n\\n\\nI just don't know what to do or where to start.

That attraction, that confidence, that connection...I don't think I'll ever know what that is like.\", 'extreme anxiety and loneliness in college before i start, yes i am aware that to solve this problem i should just speak up for myself and step out of my comfort zone and etc etc. but it really isnt that easy for me right now as im also struggling with other aspects of my life, especially social anxiety. so i just needed a place to vent without people telling me to just approach other students and talk to them. because i have done that, but it never goes anywhere else.\\n\\nso im a first year student and i struggle to make friends in college. my anxiousness is so bad and i always feel uncomfortable in a room full of others. i cant even contribute in tutorials or discussion, so people give me odd looks. the people i do want to talk to, and who i think are interesting for me to wish to be friends with are out of my league. i havent done much with my life - it is pretty boring considering i was raised as a very obedient and sheltered kid. so the people who i want to be friends with think im weird, and its true because i have no experience doing the things they do or having enough topics to talk about. so i always feel two steps behind everyone. im so self conscious of myself, my appearance, personality, experiences to reach out to anyone. even though i partly blame my parents for being way too strict on me, in the end i just feel like an idiot because they are not really the ones who gave me social anxiety and made me so boring. \\n\\nmy close friend who i used to talk to everyday has stopped putting in effort to talk to me. its very hurtful because now i literally dont talk to anyone anymore. i dont have any family members im too close with, no internet friends or relatives i like. my friend wont text me if i dont text her first, and our conversations have gotten shorter and shorter. so this contributes even more to my feeling of alienation and social ineptness.', 'The Cure for Anxiety First where we are at:\\nFocused on what others can do to me\\nFocused on others thoughts on me\\nFocused on what they can take from me\\nFocused on what I don’t know\\nIt’s fear: the unknowns that also pose a threat to something important to us. \\n\\nFear maybe makes you isolate. It’s understandable. If you isolate, and stay to yourself, maybe you also struggle with the thoughts that you aren’t important to others or even wanted. It may be natural to go to, but its destructive, because it’s a symptom that feeds the sickness. There is a deeper meaning. Isolation is protection from fear.\\n\\nSocial anxiety is a burden. It weighs down on you. Plus, you are cut off from people, so it can be hard to find relief when there aren’t a lot of people close enough to you to see the struggle.\\n\\nWe now understand what it is, and we know it’s not good, many people like us struggle out there. So now let’s think of the opposite, not fear but love.\\n\\nI know this might be hard, because maybe if I love someone, when they leave it hurts more. Connection is important to me, and I don’t want to lose it when it’s that close to me. But I don’t think we need that scarcity mentality. I think, to have the connection we want to consume, we should make it ourselves. Be the manufacturer of love, whether deep family, to light friendly, if we make it, we ourselves will have plenty.\\n\\nSo now our mindset is on others, but why? Well, we know how it feels, and others suffer like we do. We can become the person we never had. We are capable of drawing out the deep things from others. We understand them. Are you aware that most people struggle from social anxiety to some degree? Everyone is afraid, even the loud and obnoxious people we tend to avoid. Listen, people NEED you. You come with a unique life. Unique set of gifts, talents, perspectives, and experiences. You can go after connection, and it can be deep, or it can be chill or it can be fun. You want to make a connection that leaves you both feeling like someone saw you today.\\n\\nWith humility, others are more important compared to yourself. You put it there, not them. Allow you to change your mindset to focus on yourself and how you may look to them. Be there for them the way you wanted for you. Know what you wanted, what you looked for.\\n\\nThe characteristics of love are patience and kindness, no envy, nor boastful, nor arrogance, nor rude, nor self-seeking, nor irritable, nor grudges. Walk into a social situation convinced that you are kind and patient as others may also feel out of place. Your not there to build yourself up or make an image for yourself. Be prepared to count others as more important, giving them the focus and not the focus on how they experience you.\\n\\nI already love you guys, we are alike. I give this out of love. My teacher definitely did, and he taught me well. He said you can’t add moments to your lifespan by worrying. He said don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of it’s own. My teacher provided this for me, and I wanted him to provide this for you guys also', 'In College, Just developed Anxiety, and Lonely I’m in my 3rd semester and I feel like I haven’t had any fun at all I’m really afraid that I’m going to go through the rest of college without making any true friends and then I’ll be all alone and I know making friends gets way harder when your out of school.

Hi. Like the title says, I (20F Korean-Canadian) have severe work anxiety. To give you some background info to understand my situation a bit better: \\n\\nI moved to London, UK, at the beginning of this year for work. I graduated culinary school in Baking and Pastry Arts, got recruited by a famous 5 star hotel company, and moved to London at 19 alone. In the beginning I was excited. But as soon as I moved there things were very difficult for me. Turns out the UK is more different from Canada than I expected. I was culture shocked and formed agoraphobia. \\nI worked for around 2.5 months and then this pandemic hit, so I was in lockdown/quarantine for 5 months. All alone in my one room. I guess that’s where my fear started growing. I constantly thought about my skills and how I worked. I always felt like I was the only one that lacked skill in both baking and in being social and active at work. I never got to become close with my colleagues because of the short time, but also because I am very introverted. Everyone in the kitchen seemed so professional, passionate, and friendly with each other except me because I’m very new. I constantly compared myself to them. I felt left out the more I thought of it, not because of them, but because I felt alienated. Like (literally) I was really a foreigner. I’m the only asian person and also the youngest, everyone else is older than me by 10+ years, so the cultural and generational gap felt so big. I was alone in the world with no family nor friends to come back home to after a hard day. I was so homesick. \\n\\nSo because of all this, I basically spent my whole time in lockdown torturing myself and my mental health by thinking of all the things I lack, the things people at work would say/said to me that probably meant nothing but I overthought, I would think that everyone hates working with me because I just suck, and most importantly thinking about what the main executive chef thinks of me. If you know anything about the food industry, you would know it’s one of the most stressful and pressuring type of work for all physical, mental, and emotional health. Because of these self deprecating thoughts, I thought I was going crazy. I cried everyday and night. \\n\\nThen later on, the chef called me and said I would have to come back in for reopening work soon. I had a major anxiety attack thinking of going back to work and being in that pressuring situation again. \\nThe day of the reopening came and I was at work. I could feel my brain going haywire. I went to work for a week during reopening and I cried every morning and night going and coming from work. I dreaded going to work and I was so stressed and anxious constantly that at one point I threw up near the time I was supposed to close. I left early that day and just sat in the train and started bawling my eyes out without a care if there were other passengers or not. I finally decided to get help. I talked to my doctor, got diagnosed with GAD, depression, and OCD. I called my mom to tell her what happened and she immediately said to take a holiday and come back home. I decided to contact the main chef while crying and he said to take a couple days thinking of what I want to do. I got a doctors note saying I am not suitable for work and to take 12 weeks off. So I did and also booked my holidays, and came back home to Canada. \\n\\nPresently, today is my last day here in Canada. I was supposed to return to London December 23rd, because that’s when my holiday ends. But no. The hotel management contacted me and told me I need to be in for work on Christmas. I told them I would be returning the 23rd, and will have to quarantine for two weeks when I arrive. They said I can’t and need to be at work for Christmas, so to rebook my flights so I can go back to London, quarantine, and be at work on Christmas. I was so shocked because I already got approval for my holidays before I came here, and they all know that we need to quarantine when we come back. I already dreaded going back to London because I was so happy finally after long days of mental exhaustion from work, seeing my family and friends and stress free. But when they said I need to come back ASAP I felt my heart literally shatter. Told my mom about it and started to cry and rebooked my tickets. Even as Im writing this post, I am anxious thinking that today is the last day and I will be on the plane back to work tomorrow. \\n\\nYou may be thinking, if it’s that bad then just quit. But for me, quitting is something I don’t want to do. I was the one who begged my parents to let me go and I am the one on this career path. This hotel is a very well known name in this industry and can get me anywhere and more opportunities in the future. My pride is too high and also I don’t want to disappoint my parents because they told me to just bare for the last year (my contract for work is two years), which I do agree on. \\nI just think that if I have some less working time, I will be able to manage myself better. Which is why I’m thinking if I should ask to reduce my hours in half, instead of working full time everyday. But I also don’t want my pay to change because I don’t want my parents to find out I am working less after taking 12 weeks off from work, and also I would not be able to afford rent. But at the same time I’m not sure if it would change because my contract and payment states I am receiving money salary wise, not hourly. Does that mean no matter how little or how long I work, I still get paid the same? All these thoughts are in my head and I don’t know what to do. I want to go half hours but if the pay is less then I would have to continue full time. But then I would not be able to manage my mental health. \\n\\nI really feel alone in this because nobody around me my age is working, and are having fun with each other in university, partying, eating out, having money from their rich parents. It makes me feel as if I am alone dealing with “adulthood” while my friends can, obviously not relax (because I know uni is also hell), but can at least be here with each other :(  \\n\\nThis was long, thank you so much for those who read until the end. Please let me know what you think I should do.', \"The trauma I am facing, I can't share with anyone but here...

I was in an incredibly abusive relationship with a girl for 3.5 years. I had never dated before that, so abuse is and was all I had known. That includes threats of leaving for someone else if I don’t provide X Y or Z. I’m talking constantly being told, “if you’re not gonna have sex, pay, drive me, whatever else, then I’m going to go find someone who will!”. As you can imagine this shattered my self confidence and drove me into a place where I was just sleeping with someone new every couple of days after we broke up because I was trying to get revenge or fill a void. I’m not sure which, but I lost myself in that trap of promiscuity for about 8 months before finally finding someone I deeply love. It’s been very uncomfortable for me in this new relationship because I’m lost. I’ve never known a healthy relationship that isn’t always with strings attached. My girlfriend makes me so happy and I love her so much, but those insecurities and fears are tearing me apart. I don’t want to continue sharing my fears with my partner because all it serves in my opinion is making her think I think she’s going to cheat on me or find someone else. She has assured me and made me feel secure non-stop whilst also standing by my adjustments to non-toxicity. She’s truly my best friend and I love her to a painful degree. However, I don’t think I can handle it anymore. The constant fear that she’s either found someone else, or if I ever and I mean EVER don’t provide everything she wants, that she’s going to go cheat on me with someone who will. I’m leaving for a vacation in a couple of days, and the anxiety is crushing me. I can’t eat, sleep, drink, or communicate well with anyone at the moment. I’ve subconsciously accepted that it’s either I rip the bandaid off and break up with her now, or I go on this vacation and she finds someone better than me and decides to be with them behind my back or even to my face. I hate my ex for doing this to me and making me feel completely inadequate, but I feel lesser than any other man who could possibly exist. My girlfriend deserves better than me, and I guarantee she will find better than me while I’m gone. Logically, I know that’s not necessarily true, but with these insecure traumas screaming at me, I can’t shake the intrinsic fear and terror feeling that I’m having. I think I have to break up for my own sanity. I hate that I have been changed this much by my ex and that I’m potentially going to toss away something that makes both me and my girlfriend deeply in love and extremely happy because I don’t trust that there’s not someone better than me that she’ll want.

I followed their OF bc their connection is so out of this world to me I literally just wanted to learn about it bc I’ve never experienced or seen anything like it. And I did.

Now taking my phone was stupid because of Snapchat... with its weird map feature, I completely forgot about that... \\n\\nAnyway I walked to my nearest bridge and that's when I received my first phone call. My mum. I declined and put my phone on silent. I continued walking and made it to a motorway bridge. It was late so no one was using it and it was dark too. For some weird reason I decided to check my phone, I don't know why. I had messages from nearly all my family, friends. Everyone. Even my younger sister. At that point I pretty much just broke down. \\n\\nYeah... crying on the middle of the motorway bridge while cars zoomed under me. I knew then I had to do it. I climbed over the railing and sat on top of it. I was terrified. It was really terrifying. I had the belief it would be peaceful knowing I would be leaving behind a load of pain and hate but nope. Because of my fear I was just sitting there looking down. I wanted to do it but my body refuses to move. \\n\\nRemember when I said it was stupid of me taking my phone... well my mum called the police and used Snapchat to track me. I never use the maps feature so I forgot about it entirely. As a result the police came to me. There was around 3 or 4 I can't remember. They came behind me and tried to get me to shuffle back. I didn't do anything other than tell them to go away. \\n\\nThey ended up grabbing me and yanking me off the railing and restrained me. They forced me off the bridge and sectioned me. If you don't know what that means just Google it because I can't be arsed to explain it. \\n\\nI got evaluated and all that fun stuff and after 24 hours got sent home. I got home visits from a mental health team and I'm being placed into a mental health service. But I hate that... If I had just decided to not write a note... I would be gone. I still feel the same way but don't have another shot at it. Everyone knows and I'm constantly being watched. If I do get better then that's good. But right now... I just want to die. I regret writing that note so much.\", 'tw suicidal thoughts I\\'m so tired. \\n\\nI sleep at night, sleep at day. Sometimes I go to college and when I go back home, I sleep.

', 'Why was I a suicidal child Writing down my lead up and recovery as a suicidal child...\\n\\nChildhood Part One 0-June 2007 (incomplete)  \\nAshley and Mackenzie did gymnastics for as long as I can remember, Rochelle would take them directly after school and no one would be back until I was in bed. I dont remember there ever being a night during the week this didnt take place. I had basically no human contact unless I was at school or on the weekends, but even then during the designated times I was allowed out of my room I tried to stay away from everyone, which didnt work  \\nI remember sitting in my closet bawling my eyes out wondering why I couldnt go to Mackenzie’s birthday party and thinking “what did I do????” I had never been to Chuckie Cheese, the family and her friends were there. Didnt anyone care? Where did the family think I was? Didnt anyone question it?  \\nI remember it was my birthday, which was never a celebrated day so I didnt expect anything, I was sweeping the hallway as usual which was one of my daily chores. I was at the end of the hallway standing in front of the mirror which was also a door into the attic, Rochelle came out right next to me, for no reason stared at me and said “You are the spawn of the Devil, why would we celebrate today” and that statement has stuck in my head and replays every birthday since.   \\nI remember I still had bunkbeds in my room so it was probably 2nd or 3rd grade,it was a school day, I cant remember if I threw up on my pillow during the night or if it was in the morning. I was waiting until I was allowed downstairs (I had to stay in my room unless it was during a designated time of the day) but I finally went downstairs and knocked on Rochelle’s bedroom door but there was no answer so I left a note explaining the situation in my room and went to wait the 20 minutes at the end of the driveway for the school bus. I waited so long outside because I was so terrified of missing it because I knew I would get screamed at and hit and then probably made to walk to school. I came home and had expected my bedding to be washed while I was away but it was still there and the note was gone. I didnt know how to wash bedding so I flaked off the dried throw up and continued with my life  \\nI remember I was older, and had to use the restroom so badly but it wasnt my time to leave my room but I couldnt wait so I went downstairs and knocked on the bathroom door (we only had one and Rochelle was using it), there was no answer so I ran back upstairs so I wouldnt get in trouble for lingering downstairs. I made it back into my room but I couldnt hold it and peed my pants. It got on the floor of course, I changed my clothes and then went back downstairs when it was my time. I knocked on the door again but again no answer. I left a note again explaining the situation and asked how to clean it. I came home and there were cleaning products in my room but the mess was still there, but every morning after the bathroom was empty and I remember being so thankful  \\nI remember standing in the kitchen, it was one of the times she decided all three of us were a problem, Mackenzie was being screamed at and then all of a sudden Mackenzie was flying across the room  \\nI remember there being a sit-down between Rochelle, my dad, Ashley and I to discuss how Ashley felt uncomfortable that I would “look” into her room while she talked to me from the doorway or when I would walk by. My dad defended me on that one but Im pretty sure thats when Ashley got a lock that she utilized whenever she was or wasnt in the room. I never actually cared what her room looked like, I was just gazing around when I would walk by or she stood in the doorway if she happened to say something to me  \\nI remember at one point my dad had me keep a journal everyday while he was away for work, I cant imagine Rochelle wanted it but she had no logical reason to disagree. So I kept that journal. He had told me to talk about my day, what I ate, things you would jot down as a normal person except that I lived with Rochelle in that hell hole. My journal entries were 1 to 2 sentences saying I went to school, did my homework and chores and then ate jelly on Wonderbread for dinner. Man was there yelling the next time Dad came home and read that because how dare I lie and try to make Rochelle look bad because of course she was home every evening making dinners for all of us. Thinking about it I wonder what was happening that I didnt know about for my dad to single me out and think a journal was the solution. Did he notice I wasnt included in family phone calls? Did he think I didnt like him and didnt want to talk to him? Did he realize I was a depressed and suicidal child?  \\nI remember my dad was out of town working and wanted the three of us to make him a Christmas List. Either I didnt feel worthy of gifts or Rochelle or the other two said something but either way I didnt make one. Ashley and Mackenzie gave him theirs, over the phone and when it was my turn, of course I said nothing. There was yelling from Rochelle of course because I had one thing to do and I couldnt even do it so I think I said art supplies or something.  \\nI remember the first time I ever felt as if I was going to pass out I was standing behind the fancy chair in the upstairs landing and Rochelle was going on and on and I was going in and out of blacking out. I had gotten so good with my indifference face that her and my dad couldnt even tell. Probably why I over animate everything now because I was such a shell  \\nI remember every summer all summer for as far back as I can remember Rochelle would cut the grass using the riding lawn mower and I would hand rack all of the clippings. All 2 acres of it. By the time I finished she would be recutting it so it was a never ending cycle and insane blisters and long long long days. Im honestly surprised I dont have any scars and I think about this part of my life whenever Im sweeping or see anyone raking the grass. It was during one of these instances I had my first thought of running away. I had a diary, I thought it was private, and I would make supply lists for what I thought I should bring. I would trace my tears that would fall on the pages. I realized my diary wasnt private once I copied down a poem I saw on the wall of my elementary, It was only about 4 lines and talked about a house being a home and family. I then re-wrote the poem in my own words and basically stated how this house was not a home and these people were not a family. It was very soon after that I got brought down for a talk between my dad and rochelle. Of course at the age of whatever I didnt have the courage to speak up about what was making me feel this way, especially knowing rochelle would deny deny and nothing but extra punishment would come out of it. It cant of been long after that I jumped from wanting to run away to wanting to kill myself and make it easier for everyone. I decided I would take all the pills I could find in the house, pretty sure thinking back we most likely only had tylenol and other OTC nonsense. I thought about doing this for so long, and I finally picked a day but that same day I decided when I would do it was the same day rochelle announced by dad was coming back home for a visit. I always felt a little better after he left and it reminded me that it wouldnt be easier for him if I left. Chicken Soup for the Soul was big at my school then and I remember there were stories that reminded me that suicide is selfish and I may not have to feel the hurt anymore, but other people would. People I cared about.  \\nI remember I started reading the Harry Potter series around the time I was seriously considering suicide. Instead of killing myself, I read and created a world in my head. I could escape into a universe that was completely make-believe, where there was a boy struggling in a “family” that didnt want him, but was able to find a family of his own.  Rochelle figured out I was thoroughly enjoying Harry Potter and took it from me. I remember she ripped out pages from several of my books, one of them being the fifth harry potter and I told her it was a loan from my schools library. I prayed the librarian wouldnt notice and she didnt because I never heard anything. She did however rip out chapters from my complete works of The Chronicles of Narnia my dad had bought me. I’ve still never re-read them or re-purchased or even want to look at them.   \\nI remember when I was in elementary school I finished a book Rochelle had checked out for me from the public library, something she would do while my dad was home because she had to act like the caring helpful mother. I happened to finish the book quicker than either of them would have expected, they didnt believe I actually had so took it from me and stated they would now read it and quiz me. Being completely honest I dont remember them actually following through, which is actually annoying now come to think of it. I would have passed with flying colors.  \\nI feel very heavy talking about this. I feel like there is a weight holding me down, sitting on my chest. But I know I dont feel this way anymore, I havent for a very long time. Its therapeutic to finally type out my stories.   \\n\\n\\nIm much older now but I still have instances where I feel nothing. Im in therapy and finally typing this out and getting some of my story out into the world even if no one sees this feels like a lift off of my shoulders.

Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering. Why does this happen to me.\\n\\nHonest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to.

We are literally born to go to school just so we can get a job that we will most likely hate just to pay bills for the rest of our lives. I don't understand how more people don't think the way I do. I fully believe that money is the key to happiness in today's society. Being financially free and being able to do the things you want in life is the ultimate goal. College is pointless for anything other than being a doctor. Even for engineering most of the classes we take have zero real world application and 9/10 you gain more knowledge in the work force than in college. A college education now a days is meaningless the only thing college does is allow students to pay $100,000 + just to get opportunity from a piece of paper. I'm convinced most people don't actually get smarter in college since its not even about learning anymore its about passing. I just don't see how life is worth is when there are more bad things than good. The burden I feel everyday outweighs the good. Does anyone else feel like this? People try to convince me everyday that there is a reason to live but their words just make me feel worse as I continue to believe that life isn't worth it.\", 'College is horrible for depression I hate that most good paying careers have to be earned by paying a huge amount of money and constantly have to go through mental strife to get a piece of paper saying ur certified to work somewhere but u still might not get the job.

I literally was told just try think positive like my brain chemistry is messed up that not gonna help. I find it funny how professors like to act like mental health doesn’t exist until they think someone is suicidal and even then they don’t give a fuck.

I also didn\\'t get to finish writing this (because I hadn\\'t the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, \"You don\\'t understand!\" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I\\'m an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely.

But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can\\'t bother to do any of it.\\n\\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn\\'t know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that\\'s why I\\'m sitting in your office right now and I don\\'t know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\\n\\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn\\'t need to classify it as an \\'illness\\' or \\'disorder\\'.

I feel like it\\'s a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\".\\n\\nI have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn\\'t eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn\\'t going to get any better and I decided to end my life.\\n\\nI drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn\\'t back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can\\'t even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won\\'t get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\\n\\nThe everyone\\'s surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It\\'s a miracle you\\'re alive\". I\\'m not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I\\'m alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I\\'m begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don\\'t know how. I have tried CBT, I\\'m going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I\\'m on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\\n\\nIf anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I\\'m still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it\\'s a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don\\'t want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.\\n\\nPlease help with any advice you have, I\\'m begging for my life to change, please.

I have been diagnosed by different doctors with having GAD, ocd, depression and panic attacks. I wanted to make this post to see if anyone could relate or offer any kind of advice, it would be very appreciated as i am really really struggling so bad right now. \\n\\nIts really hard to describe and i have searched the internet trying to find someone who is experiencing something similar but to no avail. I basically have this horrible recurring feeling that overtakes my whole body where i feel intensely disturbed, like im living in some kind of twisted horror film or psychotic weird music video or something likr that. It sort of feels like some kind of weird fever dream. Everything sort of out of the ordinary or that my brain deems to be twisted or imperfect in any way just intensifies this awful weird feeling. Sometimes it can be so intense it literally overtakes my whole body and leaves me almost petrified, hardly able to move or talk and its accompanied by intense feelings of complete despair and like nothing at all in the world is ok or will ever be ok. I have to close my eyes and focus on my breathing cause everything i look at will intensify this feeling in my chest and throat. I cant do or think of anything cause it all makes it worse and increases this horrible, disgusting, vile feeling inside me. Its not that nothing inspires me or brings me any joy, its that doing anything 'normal' other then laying in my bed and watching a set of 'safe' videos is complete agony and makes me feel awful. \\n\\nIts really hard to describe and sometimes im convinced im going psychotic even though im fully lucid, able to control myself and no one in my life has noticed any crazy person behaviour at all. I also feel extremely foggy inside my head as well as like detached and disconnect from myself and the world, like im watching everything, even my own thoughts, through this kind of foggy mirror. My brain is also just in this weird state, for instance i will be unable to visualize things or make 'mental images' or do anything cognitive really at all, especially when this feeling is really roaring inside of me. Physically ill feel this weird nauseous sick sensation and like i have molasses coursing through my body that makes me feels slow and heavy. \\n\\nWeird or scary movies, music or books as well as 'disturbing' material in school is agonizing for me and can really set me off into terrible episodes. These are just some examples of the many things that will bother me. \\n\\nI have a bunch of other issues but i wont bring them up as they are much more easily identifiable as gad, depression or ocd related so they don't scare me as much. I also have panic attacks on occasion although much less frequently as i did before. \\n\\nIt all started in like September of 2017 and was extremely intense for around 6-7 months, so bad i had to take a medical leave of absence from school and i could barely function at all on my own. I would also experience horrible nausea and sick feelings so bad i could barely move and would barely eat for day. However, it then started to get better after a while and i felt much more like myself and this 'disturbed' feeling was way less intense. I still struggled with mental illness but it was much more ocd, depression related. The worst is the brain fog although i know that could be injury related as well as mental health. \\n\\nHowever, lately these feelings and more have come back full force. I have identified 3 events that could potentially have been the trigger.\\n\\n 1. I suffered extreme emotional trauma when i went through a breakup a couple months ago with my long term girlfriend who was my world and by far my biggest support system. Im still really emotionally affected by this and it causes this feeling in my gut of complete and utter despair so intense i can barely move, its not even sadness its more just terror and agony.\\n\\n 2. I just started at a new school in fashion marketing and everything is obviously new and different for me and the stress is elavated since i obviously have more work now. My brain takes this as 'disturbing' and now, not even three weeks into the semester, my brain already associates my school and campus with this disturbing terrible feeling which is really bad and i desperately hope i can chance this association. This is really hard without my gf to support me talk things through with, i genuinely believe if i still had her the transition to this college would be much much smoother and i may even be improving now. \\n\\n 3. The weather. Summer is ending and giving way to cold temperatures, darkness and grey sky's. I have a terrible sub conscious association with the feeling of fall and winter arriving since it is when my worst incidents and rough patches were when this whole thing started last year. The seasons changing is bringing back so many dark feelings and memories that are just so terrifying. As silly as it sounds i really think the changing weather is huge for perpetuating and causing this awful feelings and symptoms to come back.\\n\\nI feel like the world around me is just moving too fast and i am completely losing it, im completely outside of myself and my body and have no idea whats happening or whats going on, the only reason i am able to function some days is because of muscle memory. It is absolutely terrifying, i think i read something online that said it could be like 'depersonalisation' or something like that. \\n\\nYah so that's it, i understand my post is very long and probably no one will read it but if anyone does, i would appreciate it so much, this is the hardest patch of my life and the hardest thing ive ever had to go through. Im 18 and i really dont see any way this will get better or ill ever be able to have any kind of normal or happy life, i really dont, every day is so hard. And before anyone asks, i do have a therapist, i do cognitive behavioural therapy.\\n\\nEdit: also, since this all started my sleep has been greatly affected and i believe it plays a significant role in compounding my issues. \", \"Do all schools require for you to have classes if you have a depression?

There is probably a relationship with depression on the brain and norepinephrine, but I still don't find myself motivated to get a job, or doing something other than doing nothing. I'm an insomniac like a mother fucker. My body and mind go negativistically schizo. It fucks up my ability to be motivated the next day when I only want to sleep, but I couldn't fall asleep the night before. Then too, I do not go to appointments, or I do not fulfill responsibilities that are seemingly easy to accomplish. I cycle in self-pity, and self-loathe, by grandiose delusion. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are the main symptoms of depression anyways. When I get high, I battle with my memories as to which is real life vs. not. I see more delusory ideas vs. real ones. - Duely noted, I am high right now. Truthfully to relax my mind's anxieties. \\n\\nI know I NEED therapy, at least pharmacologically. But to what point do sedatives really stray from endogenous cannabinoid effects? I mean, I know I will wake up dreary, and half-able to function the next day if I take a sleeping pill the night before. Even if the dosage is reduced. If the dosage is reduced so much, over the counter medicines like melatonin or synthetics won't work. \\n\\nOn these antidepressants, I feel as though I want my mental disorder to just win, I want to reason with suicide sometimes. The funny thing is that most antidepressants have been related to suicidal ideations etc. However, in my opinion, suicidal ideations on ADs is like smoking. You get a regulated hit of norepinephrine every 20th of a cigarette, on a variably fixed gambling/addictive sense. Perhaps those are related... Anyways.\\n\\nMy question to you I guess is have you ever tried to figure out your own disorder? Are you so much of a hypochondriac that you try to figure your self out, so much so that you twist your world around so much your body is affected by your mind?\\n\\n\", \"Any advice on coping with more than one mental disorder? Hey ho, not sure if this is the right place for this but thought i would post anyway (sorry for the massive text) bit of backround on me would be useful i suppose, im 19m and a year and a half ago i was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia (although im sure ive had them both most of my life, and do realise that they are linked but they affect me differently from each other). A large chunk of my mum's side of my family suffer's from various mental disorders as well, so i know where it came from. \\n\\nMy schizoprenia normally takes the shape of seeing malicious feeling creatures in the corner of my vision and hearing them talk about me and occassionally chasing me, this is fucking horrible day in day out and grinds at my mind and eventually wears it down til i become very depressed and withdrawn.\\n\\nThe depression can be triggered by many what seem to be trivial things, for instance ive only ever kissed one girl and never had sex, this doesnt seem like a huge deal to me but being in university and playing sports, everyone i know seems to find it a huge deal, which just makes me feel bad and somehow inferior as though i havn't achieved something yet and am not 'one of the club' and when everygirl i know has friendzoned me and calls me a lovely guy and comes to me for advice on other guys it just triggers something within me, makes me think im never going to find any form of love and may as well accept the fact im going to die alone. yes i realise this may seem childish and stupid but for some reason it sends me into a deep spiral of sadness and tears.\\n\\nI have may friends at university, i get on with everyone but a severe lack of close friends makes it difficult to talk about even the littlest slight or wanting to get anything off of my chest and eventually it just explodes into some of the darkest places i have ever been, as over the summer i regularly went to sleep with a smile on my face thinking about how i would molest and kill my next door neighbours (way out of this one now thankfully but its not the first time it has happened)\\n\\nI am seeing a counsellor but i never get anything out of the sessions as i just feel that the psychiatrist is there because they have to be not because they want to help me. And i cant talk to family about it as i dont speak to my dad and my mum has enough of her own mental issues to sort out without listening to me rant about shit and my feelings.\\n\\nI have currently tried to kill myself twice and have self harmed on and off for almost as long as i can remember. \\n\\nIf i carry on now with this post i will fill up and entire subreddit with text so sorry for the rant and i apologise in advance if it seems stupid or pathetic as typing it out i didnt sound that bad but any advice would be most welcome\\n\\nx\\n\\n\", 'Life doesn\\'t \"get better\" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can\\'t bother to do any of it.\\n\\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn\\'t know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that\\'s why I\\'m sitting in your office right now and I don\\'t know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\\n\\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn\\'t need to classify it as an \\'illness\\' or \\'disorder\\'.

Though my anxiety is even worse when i'm outside I feel like everyone is judging me and can tell just how disabled I am. My  therapist tells me I'm very well spoken, even more so for how disabled I am. Though I think it's a bunch of bullshit by how i'm treated in the outside world.

I really struggle to sleep at night. My mind starts running, and all the problems in my life come to the surface as I lie down, so I’m often up all night. Then, when I finally do exhaust myself and crash, I wake up some 10 or 12 hours later with a feeling of dread that isn’t merely mental, but a heavy, painful physical sensation accompanied by stomach pains and headaches. There is an easy access to drugs within the home. I prefer pot above all else but also use ADHD meds, anxiety meds, pain pills, muscle relaxers and basically anything I can get my hands on that will get me some sort of high so I can get through the day.

I live in a small town where there isn’t anything to do but drugs.  I stopped hanging out with “bad influences” and consequently have become a loner, and still abuse drugs even though I want to be happy, sober, and productive. It really affects my self-esteem. It’s hard to have fun or laugh these days. I’m just alone and unhappy with myself most of the time. I want to change my life, but fail every day. I’ve just got a job after over half a year of unemployment after another depressive episode, and am aiming at going back to college and getting in a dorm so I can get away and hopefully make some friends.

My life is falling apart and there is nothing I can do. I got into an incredibly prestigious university in the US despite my struggles last year, and yet now I am too debilitated to keep up. I remember how excited I was during my first Zoom class, thinking this could be an end to the hopeless lifestyle I’m trapped in – but now I dread lectures and have already missed a week worth of classes. \\n\\nI thought my problem with self-harm would go away this year but it got worse. I can’t stop cutting myself out of shame, and as soon as old cuts healed, I made new ones on top of them. Worse yet, self-harm is no longer an compulsive urge or a coping mechanism – even when I’m reluctant, I feel like I HAVE to do it because of how awful I’ve let myself become.\\n\\nQuarantine has caused my eating disorder to morph into bouts of terrible compulsive eating. My mother never believes how serious it is because she still thinks it’s good that I’m eating more. She even actively brings trigger foods into the house (when I’ve told her not to) so I can ‘eat more’. I’ve tried removing certain food (snacks and junk food) from the house so I can stop binging and actually work, but every single time she stops me because ‘I’m stopping her from eating the things she likes’.\\n\\nI can’t get out of this household. I can’t get help from any of the local professionals because as soon as I mention my suicidal thoughts and cutting issue, they will alert my my mother. Her response is usually a) yelling and crying at the same time b) saying that my issues make her want to commit suicide c) screaming at me because I ‘refuse treatment ‘ d) all of the above. \\n\\nSpeaking of treatment. I can’t take medication because of my crippling fear of weight gain. I’ve already lost so much at this point so if I do gain weight I’d rather die, and every. single. goddamn. medication has a possibility to make that happen. I can’t even try the ones with a relatively low risk – as long as I know it’s a possibility, even an extremely unlikely one, I can’t do it.\\n\\nI can’t receive electroconvulsive treatment. My mother is scared of the idea of ‘having me electrocuted’, and I’ve heard of MECT’s impact on one’s memory and ability to think, so I’m terrified that it will result in me being suspended from university altogether.\\n\\nI can’t reach out to the (apparently excellent) department of mental health at my university, because if my mother discovers that I’m ‘airing my dirty laundry’ to my school she will almost definitely fly into a terrible rage. Before the semester started, she discovered I was filling out details about my mental illnesses in the  student medical form (as was required) and tried to convince me that the university will kick me out if they know my condition – that I must hide my ‘abnormality’ if I want to hold on to this position that I worked so hard for. It was only after a solid week of arguments, crying my eyes out and self-harm that I finally got over her bullshit and filled out the form truthfully.\\n\\nI can’t talk to my professors about my struggle because they’ll probably think I’m looking for excuses to be lazy. I’m even afraid to write them emails, because I don’t know the ‘proper’ way to address these issues, or *if* I should tell anyone about my difficulties at all. And if anything the college staff will probably only question why I took the course in the first place – we didn’t have to take classes this semester due to COVID, so why the hell did I set myself up for failure (inconveniencing others in the process), knowing my condition?\\n\\nBecause all I know about life is that I have to push through. I ‘pushed through’ last year even though professional advice recommended I should take a break from high school, even at one point suggesting hospitalisation. I ‘pushed through’ final exams and got very high marks, to everyone’s surprise, because without them there isn’t meaning to my life. I ‘pushed through’ college application last December, even though during the period I would visit my intended suicide site every day. If I’m not ‘pushing through’ I’m wasting my life. Knowing my mother’s antics, I can only imagine the incessant guilt-tripping if I choose to lay around and ‘shamelessly’ pursue entertainment for a full semester, while my high school friend work.\\n\\nI am an legal adult who is treated like a twelve year old, who cannot make any major decision for herself unless she has permission from ‘real adults’ who know better.\\n\\nI’m so obsessed with everything being ‘proper’ that I can’t think of a way to continue now that my life has gone off the rails. There is so much to look forward to in my life, so many things I haven’t done – yet I can’t lift myself from this mire. There is only one way out from my never ending pain and I’m too cowardly to take it.\\n\\nThank you for making it this far.', 'I’m struggling and have no one to turn to.

I would really appreciate any input or advice. I'll try and keep this succinct, as I could easily write an enormous essay about times where I have exhibited behaviour that could be explained by symptoms of Bipolar Disorder.\\n\\nI'm 22 years old, and I'm currently a PhD student. For *at least* the past 3-4 years I have suffered from long bouts of depression (some worse than others), separated by much shorter periods of feeling happy or 'normal'. Throughout this time I have abused a lot of different drugs, including: benzos, ketamine, weed, LSD, MDMA and opiates. I take drugs as a form of escapism, to distract myself from reality. (I completely avoid MDMA now, as it almost guarantees being thrown straight into a depressive state).\\n\\nDuring my happy periods, I wouldn't say I was completely manic, as I can't think of times where my behaviour has been very erratic (other than drug use I guess). My Grandma, for example, suffered from Manic Depression, and during her manic states she would go on mad buying sprees where she would purchase a load of unnecessary things. She also spent a lot of time on a psychiatric ward. After reading yesterday what hypomania is, I would say this best describes my happy periods. During this time I have lots of energy, racing thoughts, and a tendency to start new projects due to increased creativity. Colours seem way more vivd, music becomes more enjoyable, and I suddenly become extremely positive/optimistic and a lot more talkative. I've even felt almost 'euphoric' at times.\\n\\nDuring depressive periods I barely leave the house, or get out of bed. My room is an absolute tip, and I have no energy to clean it. When I eat, it's typically a carb binge takeaway, followed by a day of not eating (I've lost so much weight over the past year, and I'm starting to get very skinny). I find it extremely difficult to get any work done, and my university attendance becomes shockingly bad. My thoughts are those of hopelessness and pure negativity, and I feel just completely alone in the world. They can also be very morbid (not necessarily 'suicidal' though, I've never actively planned to kill myself). I can suffer from both insomnia and hypersomnia, but it's usually the former.\\n\\nI've also experienced mixed states, where I might have the energy to go about my normal day, but I might be extremely irritable or experience racing thoughts, a 'flight of ideas', and pressured speech. During these periods I will find it very difficult to tell an anecdote, for example. I will begin telling a story, and it will just seem all over the place as I stop and explain each and every thing I've mentioned at a million miles an hour.\\n\\nI've also experienced hallucinations before, usually when I've been extremely stressed due to high workload. These usually manifest themselves when I'm in a dark or dimly lit room, either in the form of morphing colours when I close my eyes, or shadow people reaching out at me with their arms if I keep them open. I'm not delusional, and can tell they are not really there, and turning on a lamp will usually make them go away.\\n\\nI could easily go on and write tons more, but I'll leave it at that for now.\\n\\n**Does this seem like it could be Bipolar Disorder, and do you think it might be worth chatting to my GP about this?** ([BP-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder) seems read almost exactly how I've feel during each mental state)\\n\\n**What would trying to get a diagnosis involve?** (reciting all of this behaviour to my GP?)\", 'I just written this and I just wanted to share it with someone else so here it is.   \\n\\nThe world as of current is a massive mess, besides the Covid-19 outbreak the almost everything in the world is in disarray and one of those problems that is rising slowly but will hit very hard and mercilessly in the future is mental disorders. Mental disorders is currently spreading throughout the world like a wildfire, uncontrollably but slowly to remain undetected as much as possible. Many people may not notice as they are way too busy with work or any other things to realize that the world is slowly being burnt to a crisp by more serious problems around them. The reason why the virus was on the rise is because people are starting to stay at home as the corona virus takes its toll and starts ravaging the human race by spreading swiftly across the globe. This has nothing to do with social isolation but however is just the power of our brains when it is isolated for an extended period of time, we are just so used to living with everyone else around us and everyone around us bugging us all the time that we don’t have time to think about the actual problems that we are actually facing. We just didn’t have time to think not because we can’t or didn’t thought of it, this isolation makes us feel lonely and with nothing else to do than just think we start to think about the world we live in, start to realize that our reality is cruel and unforgiving. As more and more people get bored of games and movies, they all started thinking about it, as soon as that happens more and more people start to realize the truth behind the perfect world that they were told to be living in, the fact that no matter how successful they are they can never escape the harsh reality that is suffering and it will all end with agony, there is no happy ending to a story of a human life. The only end is death and that is not very acceptable for most of us, most of us fear it. As the people that are thinking are mostly older students that range between the ages of 14-21, I am not saying that younger or older people won’t have the same effect but it’s just more commonly seen in the people within that age range are also assisted by hormone change, the stress of what they want to be in the future and how less time they have to realize. I can say that if this goes on there will be a day that mass suicides sweeps through the globe and this will lead to the rise of the decade or century of depression as people start crawling out of the well and start realizing that what they see under the well was a fake truth hiding above the well is pure suffering. With all that said, it’s not to say that the entire human life is suffering but just the world isn’t as perfect as most of us thought it will be. We can’t completely blame the corona virus for our depression because without the corona virus, this lie that we are living may be forever and I say it’s better that we live a life of truth than a life of lies even if the truth is disappointing, unnerving, unhappy and painful. As the problem progresses we slowly will be less and less productive as we lose our will to move on and our will to work. This is just the beginning of the Age of Depression, which is an age where all people live lives in the harsh reality mental disorders soar off the graphs, forcing governments around the world to take serious action against it, which will cripple the global economy once again. \\n\\nIn terms of what we can expect, it is foreseeable but only a vivid image can be seen as mental disorders are highly unpredictable, as predictable as it may seem to science of today. We can see an economic collapse as people stop needing anything besides food and other living necessities or perhaps the global demand can continue but nobody wants to work. On the standards of mental medical expertise and the availability of help to these people as of now is very limited, people may seem like they are good at psychology but believe me that they are only good at it in a scientific term, a term solely based on theories that has been proven to work in the past and is uncertain if it will work in the present. If we were want to have a chance of winning against the mental disorders, we have to start accepting new ways to treat it. This is not to say that scientific ways of treating mental disorders are always wrong but to let the world know that even things like mental disorders change so we have to change too. Besides, we can’t just throw a bottle of drugs to a patient when a therapist can’t solve their problems because this will clearly lead to another new drug problem in the future after the mental disorders problem was solved. Artistic ways of treating mental disorders are also available we just need to start accepting them, some of them may sound a little outrageous but we need to trust in ourselves that we can get the job done, we can cure the world from the disease that we are currently suffering from. Mental disorders have never been as serious as the world was mostly at war in the 19th century and not a lot of light was shined upon problems such as mental disorders. As the world slowly emerge from the conflict riddled 19th century more and more manpower is not available to seek out new types of jobs and solve new types of problems. Amongst them is mental disorders which isn’t a massive problem since its discovery in 1883 but as of now, the world is starting to show effects of the problematic mental disorders. There are lots of reasons why I bought this up, those reasons being that the people are getting depressed because they see the harsh truth and wishes to change something about it, so trying to cover up the entire thing that has already been revealed to them will only cause them to neglect what you are currently saying and walk further down the path of depression. Besides, the world can no longer have enough time and resources to get a person that is interested in psychology studies and can get an entirely perfect results in school to get approved with a doctor’s license. What they need is someone to support their ideas for once not hide what they already see there is no point in denying what they have already seen at this point so just let it be, no point saving an already lost cause. Instead, tell them that everything will be okay no need to fear the inevitable, just do what you want to do and make sure you work hard for them with your soul as the fuel for the torch that will guide you through this dark cave. People need to understand that nobody in this world can solve your mental issues no matter how hard people struggle they can never break free so do as much as you can have as much fun as you can while you still can. Science is very inflexible in itself as it is only reinforced by system after system, in short scientists can’t do art as good as how an artist can. Their personalities is art, so are their mental disorders that has been developed behalf on their personalities so we should stop treating the people that are suffering from mental disorders like some specimen but more like a piece of art. It can be called beautiful, ugly pleasant or unpleasant because everyone has different tastes. There are no such thing as ugly art, there is only people that doesn’t know which angle to view them from, people that don’t know what the art was supposed to symbolize and that isn’t wrong either because some people just generally do not like the art or the concept of it. While other people can say that it is the best masterpiece that the world has ever seen a random person can say that it is not suited to their taste. Personality is just like art, no matter how many people that enjoys a single person’s personality there will always be people that will hate them for nothing at all. People need to know the limits of science and when it is time to see that the time has come to see personality as a form of art instead of a scientific term. Science may be effective and efficient but when put up against something like artistic treatment they are completely helpless when it comes to curing without medicine. I really don’t understand why do people always neglect and reject that the fact that mental disorders and trauma can be treated without a license, without scientific terms but with an artisan way as art itself is to represent something in a beautiful way no matter if it’s simple, advanced, ugly or beautiful. Sure science can bring us there but art can bring us to where science cannot reach, someplace beautiful untouched by people that doesn’t understand it. I do think that mankind can only break the things that they do not understand but the point here is mankind has to understand and accept it. I agree that mental disorders isn’t good for us but if that mental disorder is trying to tell us a truth that has been hidden from us for a long time we should open up to it learn from it instead of pushing it aside. Isolation is the very thing that gave us a chance to think, a chance to change the lie that we have been told to us for a long time. The truth can be depressing, sad, ugly, unsettling and unpleasant but if that is the truth we have to embrace it not let it lie. This may be one of the reasons why our creator never gave us eternal life and keeps cutting our lives shorter than before because he understand that we are only living a lie that has been told to us since we are born and to only notice that death may be an unhappy ending to our lives but by that time you will soon understand that death is the most pleasant that life has ever been. For those who are still reading till here, I show a great sense of admiration to you and for those who has read this and have thought about it, I want to Thank You Genuinely. I know I am not exactly normal but special or gifted isn’t exactly the correct way to express me either. I said all that because I had the chance to notice how it feels like to be isolated for nearly 12 years and just as I was starting to crawl out of my stronghold of isolationism I was immediately slammed by another 2 years of isolation. However, I really want to thank these 14 total years of isolation that helped me to think clearer and help thinking about the possible future of humankind. I was not completely isolated from people but however in the 14 years of isolation I hid something I always wanted to talk to someone about and I didn’t because I don’t know what it was called, I didn’t have anyone to talk to so I can only bend myself to fit into society but within these two years I have since started to think about the future and about myself I found out that we don’t need to change ourselves to fit in with everyone else we can be ourselves as long as the people around us knows what we are. Slowly I saw the world that was painted in perfect colors fade in front of my very eyes. They are no longer colorful and perfect. As the colors swept away, the image of a sad, depressed and burning world unveiled itself in front of my very eyes. The world may say that this world is beautiful and successful but I wanted to ask them does beautiful mean that the world is half ablaze and people from all over the world are suffering while we do nothing to change the system at all? Everything ages, systems, humans, objects and even the world itself. It is purely up to us to change or maintain the things that are aging before they turn to rust then to dust. You may ask, what does this has to do with mental disorders. The answer is simple, as long as the people that are growing up in this world knows that they are living in a world that they will work, eat, sleep rinse and repeat the supply of depressed people will never stop until we learn how to enjoy life and how to make life look and work less depressing.', \"Requesting Advice I'm not sure where to begin, so I guess I'll just start writing.\\n\\nI am a 24 year old man. For most of my life I have struggled with a severe major depressive disorder. For a time I was doing better, but it didn't last long. I can't even pinpoint exactly how I ended up back where I am now. Panic attacks every single day, constant thoughts of everything being meaningless, being too mentally/physically exhausted to do the things I want/need to do. My mom, best friend and brother are very supportive, which I of course appreciate and love them all very much, but the only person who can fix me is me. At times, I feel like my depression adds to theirs (they are all also depressed and dealing with very stressful situations in their lives) and all I ever do is bring everyone around me down. These thoughts worsten my depression even more, and so that leads me into my questions: Are there any therapy options for someone from a small town who has state-provided, low-income insurance? I have also been seeing a doctor for many years, but I feel like every time I see him he just pushes a new pill at me. Would it be a smart decision to be seen for a second opinion and be checked for other mental health disorders (i.e bipolar), or would my doctor take offense to a request like that? And finally, if I find myself back in a very, very dark place, does the Suicide Prevention Hotline actually help?\\n\\nThank you all in advance for the advice.\", 'Need some advice on depression and studies I managed to get into a really good overseas University (QS <20) and I was super grateful to my middle income family who saved just to allow me the opportunity to study overseas and despite my anxiety I was genuinely excited for the experience. However, I barely survived the first year with really shitty and toxic friends and classmates, extremely stressful classes and other stressors associated with being on the other side of the world, away from friends and families and honestly my depression and anxiety took a nosedive during my year there, it was to the point that in the last semester, I requested to drop from a few modules in other to keep myself in check because I know that I wouldn’t have (literally and psychically) survived otherwise. Now that I am back in in my home country for the summer break, I am scheduled to return for my 2nd year of studies in late august/early September and am genuinely dreading the thoughts of going back so soon. I did try to “hint” to my parents a few days back that I might want to explore the possibility of deferring my program by a year but coming from a traditional household who doesn’t really believe in mental health, my dad literally freaked out and I honestly feel like such a failure, especially being the only child and seeing how they really sacrificed a lot just for me to have the opportunity to study overseas and I feel like I am letting them down while at the same time, I feel like my mental health have declined to the point that I am not going to do well going back at this stage.

My dad has also been “reinforcing” the notion that I am already behind having previously taken a year deferment due to Covid and border lockdown measures and how he “hope” to see me graduate as soon as possible. I don’t plan on dropping out completely nor giving up but I feel like I really need the timeout to manage both my mental health and the cornea disorder (especially since the disorder would mean that I would have to go for regular appointments to the eye specialist at 3-4months intervals) but at the same time I feel like I am letting my parents down especially when they placed their hopes and dreams on me and how I feel like a snowflake for not being able to take this “little bit of hardship”.

When he saw that it was impossible, he came back to my mother and proposed to her. \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\nI was born in 1997. The first years of my life were happy, well it is what I thought at that time. My mother cried often. But I did not understand much what was going on. When I arrived in primary school, I started getting unhappy. I got bullied regularly at school. I don't know why. At home things seemed ok for me. It wasn't.\\n\\nWhen I arrived in college, I started to get bullied for real. I had difficulties making friends. Then we moved to another city. We stayed one year in the city. That was the happiest year in my childhood. Because of the crisis of 2008, my parents were forced to go back in the city where we once were.\\n\\nI had to go back in the city where I got bullied, but I was lucky as I managed to get in a private college. There I got bullied once again, but it was only mockery. \\n\\nI was slowly growing both physically and mentally. And I started to perceive things differently. When I was 7 years old, I tried to suicide myself. I don’t exactly remember why. I noticed only when I was in my 20, that I had always been a shell with nothing inside. I did not realize what was happening around myself.\\n\\nWhen I was in Secondary School, I had a dream. One day I would be 18 (majority in my country) and I would be able to leave home. It would be a rebirth. \\n\\nI spent all of my time in Secondary School and Highschool without friends. At the time I took this well, because I knew that my time of happiness would come.\\n\\nSlowly I was realizing the incoherence that were present in my home. My mother cried often. Each Christmas. Each one. My mother would cry, and it was the saddest moment of the year. It has not changed, as at the time I’m writing this we are the 12/28/2020. Also I was not allowed to leave my house. I don’t know my neighbors. That interdiction lasted until I was 18. I was also not allowed to have a cellphone. I did not go to parties, etc… \\n\\nAlright. For now it’s a classic story, and I would say it’s not even interesting to read.\\n\\nWhen I turned 18, I instantly chose to go to a faculty, at 600km from my house. There were other faculties a lot closer. But I wanted to escape. It was the time where I would realize my dreams. Things did not go well. There is so much to say. I will try to say the least possible. The first difficult thing I had was the sensation of freedom. I had difficulties walking on the street, I had difficulty walking. I was scared the night when sleeping in this unknown location. But I think it’s common for every student. I failed my first year at the faculty. I still didn’t know what was going on at that time. I asked myself why I had failed. Of course it was my bad. When I came back home, my father did not want to pay another year of studies for me. It was my fault, I had not studied enough. And it was true. I had not studied enough. But why.\\n\\nAnd I realize why. Because my sister was still in the same hell than me. Because my childhood was affecting me. I couldn’t socialize. I couldn’t work. I now knew that I had never met anyone with the same difficulties in their life than me. Never. Of course, I know there are people who lived worse things than this. And I didn’t meet a lot of people at that time, I often stayed at home, in my nest. But it’s not the end of this story.\\n\\nSo, I came back home. My father proposed me to work with him. He is an artisan. He promised me that he would help me, form me. The first year already, things were difficult for me. You have to know he treat very well his employees. Of course. All the blame always fall on me. My mother once tried to help him in his business, but she abandoned as he was impossible.\\n\\nI didn’t know at that time that I was already trapped.\\n\\nOf course. With my father, everything has always been a trap. My mother is trapped. He forced her to stop working. Now she has no revenue. She had no friends as no one in the family goes out. But I don’t pity much my mother. Of course I pity her. But she has chosen what is happening to her. She chose to marry that man. She chose to have children with him. Me? I did not choose to be born. I did not choose for things to go like this.\\n\\nBut I will say the truth. If it was only me, I would have left all of this. Even if I was poor, it would suffice to me. That’s what I tried to do when I left home, once I was 18.\\n\\nHere’s the thing. I’m not alone. I have a sister, younger than me. She is a lot less strong than me. She is in the same situation than me. She is now 19 and has no job, no formations. She is scared of everything. She is very sad. And she is the reason of why I came back in that Hell. Why I am writing this. Why I am in despair. True despair. Not these bullshit things I often see.\\n\\nTrue despair is when you see no solutions.\\n\\nI tried everything. I tried to endure the work with my father. But it’s impossible. You want to know why? Because he is aged. He is in his sixties. He has the right to stop working, and he wants to stop. The problem? At the time he proposed to help me, he underestimated the task. I don’t know how he made, but he could not have formed me in 1 year. It has now been 3 years since I’m with him. So, one year did not suffice. But he was tired. He wanted to enjoy life. He did not want anymore to give me a future. So, he stopped helping me, forming me. I was still working, but if one day he stopped coming, I wouldn’t be able to get a job or to continue his business. \\n\\nLet’s resume the situation: he doesn’t to work anymore, but he doesn’t show it. \\n\\nAt that time, I think things are still ok. But it’s not the end. Because I am “forcing” him to help me. It is still time for him to stop everything, but his pride doesn’t allow him. If I say I stop, everything in my family falls apart. It’s pride. Always his pride. \\n\\nSo progressively. He starts to hate me. And I also start to hate him. Nowadays he considers me as his enemy. We tries multiple time to explain everything between us, but it doesn’t change.\\n\\nAnd my sister is amongst all of this, blocked. She is depressed. I cannot help her. My father make me work every day, even weekends, holydays. I mean ok. If it’s only this. But he doesn’t pay me anymore. He yells at me for anything.\\n\\nThink about the solutions I have. I can tell you that I tried everything I could think of. Of course, some things are too dangerous or illegals. I envisaged suicide multiple times. But even suicide will not help me. As the problem is concerning my sister. Should I try to leave home with my sister? Would she follow me? I think not. I don’t have any money; I don’t have a true job. We had nearly no contact between each other, I as come back from work tired and have difficulty in socializing. \\n\\nOnly several minutes ago, I was thinking about my choice. And there is a sentence which left my mouth several times in my life. “There was no solution since the beginning”. I am scared of that sentence. I suffered a lot, I worked a lot thinking there was still hope. I discovered that I had a talent. At least that’s what I think, but I’m starting to depress about it. I am a good writer in fantasy. I have good imagination. I started learning English because I wanted to publish my novels in English, making money with them. \\n\\nYou have to know that the only safe place I have is my room. I still live in the house of my parents. And the only thing I can do here is dream. I did this all of my life. I read several novels and think I am quite good. The problem is, I have difficulty writing. Either in my language or in english. It needs work, training. That’s what I was doing of my free time. I started to write several stories, but every time I stopped since my english and my writing skills were not sufficient.\\n\\nSo progressively I started to lose confidence in myself. At the beginning I even thought I was a genius.\\n\\nBut the true problem is. I can’t dream or think when I am angry or sad. I can’t concentrate. It was the last thing I add, and I can’t use it nowadays. I lost hope. \\n\\nSo the last thing that came to my mind, only several minutes ago. I would ask the world. I would ask on a forum. Do you have solutions. Did you live through something similar.\\n\\nI know that some people are giving money at stranger on internet. I spent a lot of time on internet in my life. If you can give me money, I’ll be grateful. I don’t know how to ask it, really. I don’t even have time to correct my sentences. Thank you.\", \"I want to BREAKOUT the LOOP of COMPARE AND DESPAIR For the last 30-40 days, I have been stuck in the loop of compare and despair.

I moved to Italy(2 months ago) from Russia and started my life completely from scratch. I got accepted in university and started interesting program in English language. Also, I found 3 part-time jobs finally to sustain myself and not depend on my family. I have a boyfriend here that I am completely in love with.

But, it turned out, that being away from family, friends, hometown, where everything is simple and so habitual, made me feel even worse.

Too many new things, too much pressure, too much studies, too much work to do, too much time being alone at home, pandemic, not being able to go to cinema, not having friends at all. \\nI just simply don’t know how to overcome this.

I feel like im disrespectful towards people who are really in need of assistance since i never actually got diagnosed with depression and i havent had any major mental health problems up until relatively recently. \\n\\nI [M17] am from Serbia and im currently in grade 3 of 4 in highschool. Online classes have been going on for a year and a half with on and off mixed schooling system (involving one group of 15 going to class while other group stays at home). Needless this system has had catastrophic consequences on my grades, health aswell as my psychological state. The sheer chaos of proffesors going by their own rules of hosting classes almost whenever they want, not hosting classes, little to no assignments almost no lectures leaving us to rely on ourselves and written materials (im on natural sciences programme so figuring out analytical geometry and vectors by yourself is not easy) and expecting us to somehow pass tests with respectable grades when we come to school to take them IRL.\\n\\n This has gradually led me to completed and utter breakdown after year of quarantines, video classe and isolation. But the worst began in my 3rd grade since the pandemic started in my 2nd grade which i somehow managed to pass with good grades (mainly 4.88/5.00 /Our grade system is 1-5  with 1 being the worst and 5 the best). After the summer in 3rd grade i dealt alot with feelings of exhaustion, utter sadness and hopelessness. Alot of times i wondered about just ending it all. My grades plummeted, i had absolutely zero motivation for anything and my concentration was non existant. Somehow the semester ended and i was left to deal with my complicated familial situation after the divorce that happened two years ago which also made life pretty much bleak.\\n\\n The second semester isnt currently going any better and i only have two more months to pull my grades from a ditch and today i found out i got a 1 in English.\\n\\n On top of that my math teacher pretty much just told me openly how he \"lets me get a 4\" which i already suspected down deep inside of me. I felt so defeated when he told me that. All these years i have been trying my best and i was getting 3 most often in math. This just crushed me even knowing whenever i was retaking tests to bring my grade up, that i really was just doing a little sympathy dance to excuse a higher grade i was never really worthy off. \\n\\n\\nAll this was happening in front of some a year younger all star student who was retaking a test trying to get a 5 on some logarithms test from last year. I looked him in the eye and just told him that i know. He looked down and just quietly told me that im being too honest.\\n\\n Jesus that was hard, looking at some student just being so much better at everything than you are and your proffesor discussing what i felt like my intellectual ability in front of another student. I already have crippling insecurity regarding my IQ i dont need it to be paraded around. I like to think that i know what it feels like to be dead, the sweet embrace of void just to free me from this horrific and pathetic excuse of an existence. I hate myself so much. I just got out of nearly suicidal state a month ago and i feel like im not far off again. I tried therapy and it never really worked out since all i got was generalised bs that never really struck a chord with me.\\n\\nI dont see the point in anything, in the end everything will be completely voided and oblivion will consume everything. The most horrific realisation is that all of this is completely random and without any point whatsoever. Life, death in the end its completely the same after our inevitable demise. Why should i stick around for at best mediocre experience of paying my bills and doing my taxes? Love is nothing more than  a mere chemical cascade which i will never understand; nothing more than a drug high that wears off after some time. Dating and marriage is as rational as a free market of any other commodity out there.\\n\\nIt would be just so easy to end it all, no pain no suffering.

If I'm being honest I feel bad about it, I feel guilty, like I'm bringing my burden onto others. If this post isn't allowed or doesn't really fit then please by all means get rid of it. I'm someone who has struggled on and off with depression from a very young age. My last and worst battle with it was a majority of high school. I've since graduated and I'm in college now. \\n\\nI'm not someone who deals well with being sickness, not that I think anyone does, or likes to be sick. However I've been sick for around a week now and my symptoms started out small and gradually got worse. It was a cold, of course. My immune system was probably compromised from stress and work(I'm in retail and worked 5 days straight leading up into Christmas). Sore throat, stuffiness, all of the wonderful things you deal with when getting over a cold. However 4 days ago I had a new symptom appear that I, in my almost 21 years of life, have never ever experienced before. My ears were filling and stayed plugged. I'd finally had enough so after my first night of dealing with the pressure the best I could I went to urgent care, wanted to make sure that the cold wasn't something else. The doctor I saw was very kind, explained to me that yes it was a cold, and she did see a little bit of fluid in my ears. She gave me a steroid pack and told me that within a couple days it would clear up. I started that day. Yesterday it was still just as bad, feels very full, very painful. We call the doctors back, they set us up to see a regular doctor. We go, I'm told that there's nothing they can do for me. I leave, feeling worse than before. \\n\\nThis morning there has still been no improvement, no relief, no depressurizing. I'm in pain constantly, I couldn't sleep last night until I took a sleeping pill and not even that was able to keep me through the night. I can't really hear out of my ears right now because of the pressure. Everything sounds very, very distant and it scares the hell out of me. I feel so hopeless and so depressed and pathetic. We had family in town for the holidays I was so looking forward to hanging out with and I couldn't because of being so sick. They flew home this morning. I haven't been able to dredge up the energy to go wash my hair because the pressure is so intense that I can barely stand or focus. \\n\\nOver the past 36 hours I've probably had 6 or 7 hysterical episodes. Fits of screaming in pain, crying, pull my hair out, hitting myself, they last for hours. I just don't know how else to express the fact that I am in so much pain and there isn't anything I can do about it. I still live at home and my mom is a saint of a woman who has sat here and taken care of me through all of it. She deals with my outbursts and honestly she's the only thing that has kept me from trying to do something to myself. I feel guilty because she takes care of me, because when I have these outbursts I can be mean or say mean things that I don't actually mean. \\n\\nI'm scared by the amount of intense fear and sadness I feel. I want to die, and that scares me too. I just feel like if I'm in constant pain and no one can help me then what is the point? What's the point of me being here if all I can do is suffer so intensely. I feel stupid, like I'm making too big a deal out of a cold, but I don't feel like anyone understands that I am in pain constantly. There is NO reprieve. There is no temporary relief. Just a lasting, throbbing pressure in my ears. I just find myself wishing I were dead so that I didn't have to deal with this pain anymore. I just don't know where to turn, I just don't want to lose my sanity to this because in all reality it feels like I'm slowly going insane. \\n\\nI don't want to fall into my depression again, but this is really bringing me back to the deepest depths and I don't have the energy or the will to keep my head above water.\", \"Spiralling into Despair For slightly more than 7 months, I've been able to push aside all of my setbacks and my shortcomings. As such, it has been taking a toll on me, as the title suggests. My studies have always been my top priority, especially because i've been conditioned to think that way although it had only impacted me just a few years back. It has come to the point where I wouldn't mind dying due to the crushing shame by my academic failure. I've always been told, this year, that I'm doing fantastic in comparison to my isolated depressive state the previous year. I've been one of the few who had managed to snatch a spot for the academic award for the 1st semester but to me, it just isn't good enough. I have not done enough. I've constantly been reminded to not put my studies before my wellbeing, as they are aware of my background. My goal for this year is to achieve straight A's and hopefully, a scholarship to further my studies so as to not be a burden to my father. There's no other paths or detours that i'm willing to take. As i've mentioned earlier, I wouldn't mind dying. My friends don't exactly care, I've been left to rot. There's nothing else i'm worth, i'm a defect and the scum of the earth.\", 'Existential Despair I\\'m not sure if I can effectively translate my thoughts and feelings into text, but I will try.  \\n\\n\\nFor the past several years, I have been extremely existential, which I believe has lead to my depression.  I was diagnosed with MDD and an unspecified psychotic disorder about a year ago.  I have been prescribed many different medications and found that Prozac works best, and I made it through the psychotic episode.  Still, I suffer from extreme existential despair.  Nothing seems to matter.  I must find the meaning in everything.  I cannot move onto the next thing before I know everything about the previous.  When talking to someone, I have to figure out why the person feels a certain way about anything before I can move on.  I try to be virtuous to an extreme degree.  I\\'ll get stuck on things and they will eat away at me.  If I forget something, such as a word, phrase, or idea, I\\'ll do whatever it takes to remember it, track it down, etc. to the point where I\\'m crying with frustration.  I try to read and write, but that just provokes more thinking.  In certain situations, I can block out the intrusive thoughts by repeating a single word in my head, almost like a chant, until I start thinking about it and draw my conscience towards it.  One negative remark or interaction during an otherwise nice day will spiral me downwards, past the meaning of instance and onto new despair.    The list goes on and on.  \\n\\n\\nI have been through therapy with little positive return.  I meet with a psychiatrist regularly, but she just controls medications.  My SO tries her best to put up with this, but she does not understand and just suggests to stop thinking about it.  My parents are not an option.  I am returning to the point where suicide seems reasonable.  All I want to do is just go live in the woods as a nomad where I would read books, hunt, and live in solitude.

I’ve been a failure for so long now, that i don’t even know anymore how to start to better myself. I guess my downward slope in life began when i was 17 years old, after my father died of cancer. During the years after that i did quite alright, but because i never processed the death of my father very well, that would come to haunt me. I got a degree in a trade and did that trade for a bit. Even though i never liked it, i chose it because people recommended it to me and i had no clue what else to do. At 20 i moved away to live by myself because living with my mother became unbearable. It would become more clear later why this was the case. While i was living by myself i chose to get a higher education, but unfortunately flunked out. This is when depression hit me like a truck. I didn’t know what to do with my life, didn’t want to go back doing the trade i hated, depression caused me to loose any willpower to get the smallest things done, and above that my mother started to show more and more disturbing behaviour.\\nI just stopped partaking in life i guess. Throughout the years my mother’s behaviour became very worrying, and i slipped deeper and deeper in the black pit of depression. Eventually my mother got diagnosed with schizophrenia, and because she was handling her personal finances more and more irresponsibly, and refused to receive any kind of help or treatment, i had to battle it out in court against her in order to get a financial administrator to look after her finances. The judge agreed with me, and not long after that my mother got sued by somebody else for her behaviour, and in that case the judge decided my mother had to be taken to a mental hospital for treatment. She stayed there for 3 years, and after that she was allowed to go home again. She is doing ok now. She takes her medication and is followed up by a team of medical professionals.\\nUnfortunately i haven’t gone anywhere. I remain in the claws of depression, and feel like i can’t get out. I am 33 years old now and wasted so much of my life. Time moved on but i haven’t. I’ve tried therapy, but came to a point where i felt it didn’t benefit me anymore. I am sick of my situation and want to do something about it, but don’t even know where to start, or how to start. I have a lot of unhealthy habits, haven’t had a job in so long, haven’t had a girlfriend for just as long. How do i even explain that gap to an employer?

I am 29 years old and live in my parents\\' house, but I have my reasons for that and I am not a mama\\'s boy. I have put some money into this house myself and I am 50% owner. If I start a family, this property would go completely to me and my parents would move out. I still live here because I enjoy the peace and quiet of the village and the house is nice and big and has a big garden. My father had a stroke (he is well again), so it is easier for me to support with the house. Of course I also save rent, but for that I have invested in a solar system and a charging station for an e-car. Unfortunately, with my 29 years I have not yet managed to get a woman interested in me. I would describe myself as very helpful and also romantic. It is said that I am a good friend on whom you can build. I always make an effort to have an open ear for the people who are important to me and to rebuild it in case of problems. I like travelling very much and mostly to Japan. My hobbies include photography and my profession as a computer scientist. It is probably lucky that I could make my hobby also to the occupation. To keep fit I go to a local gym twice a week.

Due to the many rejections or no answer at all, I have become a very shy person with less self-confidence than would probably be good. Slowly I am losing hope to ever be able to start a family. I have already tried on websites for singles, in singles groups on Facebook and I have already gathered my courage and called the radio. Unfortunately, as you probably thought, without success. Sure you can say: \"don\\'t search with cramps... it won\\'t work out\", but there are no singles in my circle of friends anymore, how will the right one find me.', 'The tidal wave of despair and hopelessness Does anyone else experience the black tidal wave of despair, doom, hopelessness etc... out of the blue? I woke up today feeling perfectly fine, and then I started to dwell on some minor things. My anxiety and depression start flaring up, and I\\'ve gone from about a 10 to a 90 out of 100 in the span of a few hours. I feel horrible. I feel like a piece of walking human shit. I feel worthless. I feel like no one gives two shits about me. I feel like I am drowning in sorrow. I don\\'t know, I just feel fucking done, like all the joy and everything has been sucked out me. I hate this feeling, but man it came on so suddenly and out of the blue! Sigh...  \\n\\nAnd then of course I have my rational brain trying to tell me \"Bear calm the fuck down!\" but of course it isn\\'t working. Sigh... \\n\\nAnyone else get this way? \\n\\nAnd no I never really have manic episodes or anything like that, if that is where possible questioning is going (not that I have anything against people who are bipolar). But boy does my depression kick in to nuclear overdrive sometimes, and today is one of those days. ', \"Despair..... Hey new to this. I am a 23 yr old male. I have been through a lot in a short amount of time. From failing out of university to going to jail for racking up DUI's and getting into drunken fights to being out for almost 2 years now going back to school and working full time. In my everyday life I constantly remind myself how stupid I was for getting into all that trouble from drinking and how much it has fucked up my future. I wanted to originally go work on wall street and but chances are slim to none in that field in regards that I have a felony on my record and it cannot be expunged. When i got out of jail after serving my time I told myself I would be happy no matter what cuz i wont be in jail anymore and can do what I want. Then I found myself being depressed because i couldnt find a job, I then found a decent job at a call center making decent money but I then found myself become depressed because this job sucks but i need to keep it because its so hard to find a job that will hire me with a criminal records. People may say i have self pity for myself but it is just so hard to go through life having a felony. I am also constantly depressed at the fact that no matter how hard i try to not compare myself to others i constantly do. all my good friends are graduating college, getting good high paying jobs, moving out of their parents house and traveling the world. These things are very hard for me to achieve but i constantly search and search for a resolution to try and get to the point and every time i think i find an open door it ends up leading to nowhere. I am back in school but it is just difficult to keep up with all the work and find motivation when in the end of the day if i do everything right I still may not be able to reach my goal. Basically my goals aren't too crazy, I just want a career, making a livable salary, being self-sufficient and be living on my own, be able to be proud of my job and be able to provide for loved ones. Sometimes I just feel like I wanna die but not kill myself because my life is just a constant struggle everyday with myself and to impress those around me(family members and friends) . I am just going through the motions and I just feel like I need to fake and lie about my life everyday to others just make me feel better about myself. I really just wanted to share this and see if anyone has any decent recommendations or advice. Thanks y'all\", \"A lot of despair and confusion I'm having difficulty moving ahead with life and becoming an actual independent adult. In the past few years I've felt very fatigued, lethargic and lacking motivation. I need help. \\n\\nAlso, I feel absolutely awful because I can't decide on my future - what I'm doing about a career. It's like this since high school (secondary school in the UK) from which I still can't move on.\\n\\nMy university course has been disappointing with only a few rare good moments so I'm doubting if it's worth continuing or if I should move on and do something else. Perhaps transfer somewhere else closer to family and friends. \\n\\nI'm full of regret because it feels like I wasted a lot of time. This is quite painful. On top of this it's financially stressful. After 3 years it still bothers me how well all of my classmates are doing while I'm struggling. \\n\\nI put in a lot of effort but it seems like everything is going wrong - isolation, loneliness, failure, humiliation.\", \"How have you bounced back from the depths of despair? My life is at a crossroads. In six months time I will be either:\\n\\na) Happy and contented, or  \\nb) Dead\\n\\nIn my life I have survived a fucked up childhood, in which I endured years of physical and emotional abuse. I have survived homelessness. I have overcome a lack of education, and now count multiple Oxford / Cambridge graduates among my working peers.\\n\\nI have many trophies of success. I am at the very top of my field. I earn a six figure (GBP) salary. I have just bought a house equivalent to $800,000, in cash. In spite of the pandemic sweeping the world right now, I am the most financially comfortable I have ever been. I have a fantastic wife and two beautiful kids.\\n\\nIf that all sounds like a recipe for happiness, then it overlooks what is going on inside me right now.\\n\\nIn 2016, aged 31, I was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition. This condition was asymptomatic, and remains that way for many people. In some however it can, if left untreated, be fatal.\\n\\nMy cardiologist pointed out that at 6ft and 17 stone (240lbs) I was considerably overweight and that if I wanted to avoid dying young then I should do something about it.\\n\\nSo I did. I sorted out my diet, cut down drinking, stopped smoking and started regularly going to the gym. In 18 months I had lost over 5 stone (70lbs).\\n\\nI felt great. I looked great - I hadn’t even planned to go that far, but for the first time in my life I could see my abs. More importantly, for the first time in my life I felt truly comfortable in my skin, and my career began to really take off.\\n\\nAgain, all good right? Well, it was. Somewhere along the line, something changed. My weight became harder to maintain. I started feeling extremely sensitive to the cold. I had incredible insomnia. My energy disappeared - I felt as if I was constantly walking through treacle. I felt generally ill all the time.\\n\\nTo help solve the unbearable insomnia, I started drinking again. I also found that drinking on a night reduced the exhausted, treacle feeling I was experiencing. Of course, drinking is not good for the waistline - something by this point I had become a little obsessed about (think of a self made rich person who becomes incredibly tight because they’re terrified of losing everything they’ve worked so hard for - this was my attitude to eating). So I started eating less, and pretty much just the raw protein I needed for my gym work.\\n\\nI realised that any diversion from my very restrictive eating plan would then cause very quick weight gain - something I was now frightened of. Two or three days of overindulgence at Christmas could easily see me gain 10 - 15lbs in weight that would then be very stubborn to shift, it just didn’t make sense. It felt cruel that six months of hard, hard work could unravel in days.\\n\\nIt started affecting my work. I was making up all sorts of excuses to avoid situations where I might have to eat something outside of my increasingly short list of acceptable items. I avoided social situations. The whole experience was exhausting, and I recognise now that I was exhibiting many symptoms of both alcoholism and anorexia (something which as a man, a father of two kids, I find very hard to comprehend). And believe me, alcoholism and anorexia are not good bed fellows.\\n\\nI started to become very depressed. So I began drinking more, and eating less. But the strategies I had used to maintain weight before were beginning to lose their effect. The scales were creeping up, almost no matter what I did.\\n\\nThis included not eating at all some days. But then this massively back fired too. I was attending a pitch with work in London. I do these regularly - my job involves a lot of public speaking. I’ve always enjoyed that aspect.\\n\\nI felt fine, usual nerves that go away after a couple of minutes. But then, out of nowhere, I suffered a full blown panic attack. I had never experienced this in my life before. My heart rate was though the roof, I was shaking like a leaf, sweating profusely, experiencing the most awful sense of dread. I’ve never felt so dizzy in my life, and I had the most compelling feeling of needing to get out of the room, but I knew that if I had bailed out my career would have been all but over.\\n\\nI managed to get through the pitch, despite my incredible discomfort. As it happens, we won the business.\\n\\nBut it didn’t end there. Now, every speaking appearance I make, which is basically my job, I end up in that very same state. To a degree, lockdown has enabled me to get away with this. It’s unpleasant, but I can shake to my heart’s content on a video conference and no one really notices. I’ve measured my heart rate on my phone and at peak times, I’m approaching 200 BPM, sat still on a chair.\\n\\nI’ve been getting away with it, but if I had to go and do a meeting in person tomorrow, I do not believe I could do it, as pathetic as that sounds for someone who’s been doing just that, very successfully, for the last 15 years.\\n\\nI have been incredibly successful in my work over the years, against the odds really, but I cannot help but feel that at 35 years old my best work is behind me. I am a shadow of my former self. My ability to do my job and provide for my family is very much in doubt. My life's work is very much on the brink.\\n\\nFor the last twelve months or so I have felt crushed by a crippling depression. I cannot remember what the emotion of joy feels like. I am in agony constantly, both physically and emotionally. I’ve made two half hearted suicide attempts in the last twelve months. The third attempt, should it take place, will be anything but half hearted.\\n\\nI recently discovered that my testosterone levels are catastrophically low. Around half of what a healthy 80 year old man should expect, and around a sixth of where I should be for a man of my age.\\n\\nSymptoms of low testosterone in young men? Loss of energy. Weight gain. Insomnia. Depression. Anxiety.\\n\\nCauses? Extreme weight loss. Malnutrition. Excessive use of alcohol.\\n\\nWho knows whether there’s a connection or not, but I certainly tick a lot of boxes.\\n\\nI am about to embark on a programme of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) to normalise my levels. If this is indeed what I’ve been grappling with, we’ll soon find out.\\n\\nIt’s my last roll of the dice. It’s either the panacea to my woes and it ends the agonising pain I am in, or it isn’t, and I end the agonising pain I am in. Six months. That’s what I’m giving it. The date is in the diary; 1st February 2021 - happy or dead.\\n\\nIf I am able to come through this, I have promised myself that I will join the Samaritans. I will write about my experiences in the hope that I can help others. There are events of the last couple of years that are darkly comedic.\\n\\nBut in the meantime, inspire me, how have you bounced back from the depths of despair and turned your life around?\\n\\nTime for another beer...\", 'Stuck in an endless pit of toxicity and despair. So I recently migrated to a new country for my studies, my parents also wanted me to take them there after they retire(which is in 3 years), so I had no choice but to move here. I also had no choice but to live with my uncle\\'s family. It\\'s an extremely toxic environment, where everything I do is judged, where I try to help as much as possible but nothing is ever noticed and all I hear are murmurs behind my back. My uncle\\'s work, he takes his children and family with him to do it. I am a college student, bound with the pressure of becoming a good retirement plan for my parents. I have to prioritize studies, sadly they do not understand and my parents too. They don\\'t say anything, but I know they hold it against me. Every message I get from my parents is just pressure and pressure, to make me to a slave. It was their bidding that put me in this situation, why should I be ashamed when it was then who forced me here for their sake. My eldest cousin is the one most openly toxic to me, \"You\\'re so weird, you\\'re so weird.\" \"Do this. Do that.\" \"You can\\'t always be locked in your room, open it. \\'\\nI recently tried opening up to my dad about this stress the toxicity is giving me. All he said was\" Malay ko sa yo\" (Something akin too, \"I don\\'t know what\\'s your problem\") Every conversation with my parents is how ashamed they are of me and how I\\'m a disgrace. The family I am living with rn, talks behind my back. They try to act neutral and all, but I know they want me out. I want out too, but my parents don\\'t want me out. I don\\'t know, I\\'ll probably be in this hell for 3 or 4 years. I want to move out but my parents don\\'t want. I\\'m trying, but I guess not enough. I think they want be to be a full time slave, full time worker and full time student. I don\\'t know, I also don\\'t have a moment of silence as my room\\'s door cannot be closed, my eldest cousin always demands that both doors be open(it\\'s not a single door but it\\'s like a closet door) , and right outside my door is their dining place, their sofa and the kitchen. (They live in the basement because they\\'re renting the top floor as they have another home). So I get no privacy at all times, toxicity from everyone around me, even from my parents thousands of miles away, in another continent, and no hope of escaping. Even if I escape, I\\'ll be pressures by then to be their retirement plan as they\\'re retiring with 0 savings or investments very soon. I don\\'t know how I\\'ll live. I don\\'t have an escape anymore, I cannot get silence anymore. I cannot get inner peace anymore. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. Sorry if I sound a bit incoherent. I\\'m just so sick of it all.', 'Lost in a sea, surrounded by nothing but despair (18 btw) Dear Reddit\\n\\nLook i know the title is corny alright i get it but...thats just how i feel now and have been feeling for a while. This is the first time ill be posting here and hopefully i get some help or advice because honestly, i have nobody else to talk to about this.\\n\\nSo here is the situation\\n\\nIm currently 18, mom passed away when i was 11 and thats when everything started falling apart. I was born in Greece, parents split up when i was 4 and had a fragmented relationship to say the best. I loved both mom and dad but as dad loved to say, \"you are a mommas boy\". She came to Australia on her own when i was 9 to seek medical treatment for her cancer (Greek healthcare is nowhere near as good as here plus she had family here she could stay with), leaving me alone with dad.\\n\\nDad was the kind of person that would be sweet to you but then show you his other side when it came doen to school work or homework. My grades started declining when mom left and so things werent great at home with dad. Anyway, mom could see my life wasnt going so well so after travelling back and forth between Greece and Australia for Christmas, we both secretely travel back to Australia where i have stayed for the past 8 years.\\n\\nNow dad was obviously not a fan and for many years would try and persuade me to come back but when all else failed, he just disowned me and didnt speak to me for another 4 years. Mom on the other hand, mom was very sick and as i said by the age of 11, i stood by her bedside and said one last goodbye to her before they turned off her life support.\\n\\nNow that the backstory is in order, lets gloss over sone other parts. Got bullied between years 5 and 7, moved schools multiple times, struggled with mental health which i was always told to \"just deal with\", and largely grew up for a few years with my grandparents who were...old fashioned to say the least. That relationship soon became toxic and i moved in with my aunt.\\n\\nNow, my aunt never expected to have kids, never even planned to marry so i knew our relationship was going to be tough but man, over the past two years it has disintegrated. These days we barely talk, as im 18 now im expected to pay rent weekly (200 dollars/week which is insane considering i work at McDonalds). Our relationship is less so a family relationship and more of an Airbnb. I have my big HSC exams for year 12 starting in mid October and im planning to move out before then because i just cant take it anymore.\\n\\nThe main reason, and i wont lie here, i made this post was because i crave some sort of emotional connection. My mom, who was the only person i ever had a connection with vanished when i was at a young age, my dad disowned me, my grandparents are toxic and old fashioned, spouting stuff they know theyll regret later and my aunt has turned from the cool aunt whom she always promised to be, to yet another toxic family member whom i now have absolutely no bond with. My friends arent really the type i can talk to about emotional stuff with, my psychologist can only talk during bookings and really...i just have no one else.\\n\\nNow im going to try and frame this properly because i know how scummy it can sound if i dont. All my friends around me are getting into relationships, whether they are friends from school or work. I...i just wish i had what they had and im not saying this in a selfish way. Im happy for them i trully am i just wish i could find someone just as they have not to carry my emotional baggage, but to be there to support me. Trust me i know relationships built on just each other being emotional support for one another isnt healthy but i just need someone that can be supportive. Ive been trying hard on my own for the past 7 and a half years and im slowly loosing my grip. \\n\\nIve moved on from the horny teen mood of looking for sex and intimacy and all that and i just need someone i can talk to, someone i can confide in someone i can laugh with, cry with, hug and just socialise. As i said relationships built on carrying each others emotional baggage isnt healthy but i just need some sort of support or i feel like im going to lose it\\n\\nAnyway\\n\\nThank you all for reading this. I didnt expect to write this much so i applaud you if you managed to read through all of it.  Any form of support or advice would be greatly appreciated\\n\\nRegards\\nJames', 'My feelings of Existential Despair During my freshman years in high school, I believe my depression came from my lack of social skills and my mom telling me how embarrassing it was to not have any friends. However, I think it grew into something greater and far more potent than that. I decided to pursue Philosophy in university to perhaps find an answer, but I do not know whether that was the right choice.\\n\\nFor the past few years, I\\'ve felt complete and total despair. It comes when I think about how ephemeral my achievements might be, had I been in possession of any, and how vain my life is in the grand scheme of the universe\\'s timeline. The thought that absolutely nothing in this world can bring lasting happiness or meaning, that is, no relationship, form of entertainment, person, religion or anything else that sources escape fills me with a dread that is nothing like anything else I\\'ve felt and seems to be esoteric, if not ineffable to other people. It feels like an extremely deep... hole(?) of despair and emptiness and a kind of gnawing in my chest area.\\n\\nNo matter how great I might or could be, I will die and the timeline will move on. I often wonder how people can go about their lives with so much vigor and enthusiasm. Also, I simply can\\'t agree with the idea that you can \"make your own meaning\".

This will be lengthy, thank you in advance for those who take the time to read.\\n\\nI am a 19 yr old college student on a pre-med track in college. I got a full ride scholarship to a prestigious private university. I live at home with my mom, sister, and father. My father is a sociopath. No I am not a mental health professional or a doctor, but that is the perfect word to describe him. Since I was a child he has done nothing but psychologically and physically torture me. I grew up with zero self esteem. It was all about him and his image, he would say horrible fucked up things to us even as a kid, and to my mother as well. He has taken the hope out of us. Every day I want to fucking die. My father does not work. My mother pays all the bills, but he has us wrapped around his finger, I fear him and so does my mother. I think because he completely fucking dominated us psychologically and beat the shit out of us on numerous occasion. When I got older I learned to box and became a bodybuilder in order to protect my mother. I have had many fist fights with him. But when i fight him I am scared to hurt him, I am more like defending me and my mom. So he takes advantage and beats the shit out of me. One time he fucked me up with a fucking 2 x 4 for smoking a cig outside my sisters school when picking her up, because people will see me smoking and smoking is not a cool thing and people know us so it makes him look bad. So he hit the shit out of me with a big ass piece of wood. He made me fucking hate myself. He has no job, but yet is very well known in the community and local politics, yet he is literally the fucking devil. I contemplate ending it all every day. I work 35+ hours a week delivering pizza in a dangerous AF area (I live in NJ) in order to help my mom out (she's a kindergarten teacher) with the mortgage and bills. My grades are suffering. I have zero friends. I can't talk to my mother because she is always in the same state as me. I was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychiatrist; caused by my father. I have no one to turn to but here. You the one reading this is the only one who knows my personal fucking hell. I feel at ease when I think of killing myself because I won't have to deal with him anymore. I am thinking about dormimg at my school, but I can't afford it at all, unless I take out loans. That is my only way out. My mother has given up all hope, she won't even think about finding a solution because she thinks there is none. I am fucking alone, with no friends, and nobody who gives a fuck. I really want to end it all. If murder was legal I would kill my father. I fail to see the hope in my life, even though I go to school. On top of that my dad fucks other women, and my mother doesn't care, she just accepts. She is drained and is working her ass of waiting to die of old age, while my father lives off of us, is a big shot in the community, fucks women on the regular, and torments us and physically and verbally assaults us. My situation is dire. My life is in shambles and I have never felt such a deep deep despair in my life.

How to help myself? (*I don't post very often on here, just a resident lurker, so I apologise if I waffle on or if I write anything I'm not supposed to.*)\\n\\nDear Redditors, I need your advice and your help with the terrible duality of heartbreak and depression. Let me give you the details to my dilemma...\\n\\nI'm a 22 year old male from England, and whilst I've had anxiety problems all my life, I've had depression since I was 16 - back in 2011. Because of this, I feel ashamed to say I don't work...I can't work. But I was lucky I suppose, because I had an excellent relationship with my family and a loving best friend/girlfriend. Both were there to support me. \\n\\nLast year (2016) was possibly the worst year of my entire life. January passed with the usual mundanity it always has had, but February...it will never seem the same ever again. For a few weeks I'd shut myself away - not talking to my girlfriend. I didn't feel good enough for her (I never had), I was ashamed of myself and I felt suicidal. Of course, when I finally started talking to my girlfriend on Facebook one evening, I knew what was going to follow. This woman, who I had known for 12 years - who had been my best friend and my lover, decided to split up with me, and over Facebook at that. At first, I felt nothing and decided we could try to continue to be friends, but then something snapped inside of me. I told her how I felt for what she'd done, spilling bottled up emotions across messages and so she left - no longer my friend, let alone girlfriend. It was the start of the intense pain and heart-ache I have felt every day since then. All through this - my father's mental health also deteriorated (though unrelated) and he almost committed suicide.\\n\\nFebruary of this year comes along. I'm doing better - I'd lost weight, was healthier and starting to get over her. But one morning, a fateful reapproachment happened, entirely by accident.\\nTo summarise (as I had started writing paragraphs...), despite my initial hesitance, we reconnected and the romantic feelings flooded back for the both of us. My mental health tanked, to say the least. I became a nervous wreak, trying to hide my breakdown from her, so as not to scare her off. Alas, eventually she decided it was best to leave again and that same intense heartbreak reappeared.\\n\\nSince then, I've been an emotional rollercoaster. I will go weeks with relatively good mental health (usually when I am busy volunteering) but equally, I will go weeks with debilitating, mental health, if not with suicidal ideations. No matter how good my mental health is, this woman...she hangs over me and invades my thoughts - I can't get rid of her. I feel intense sadness and anger, at myself and her and can do little but merely survive, but not live. \\n\\nI had started counselling, but due to the lack of NHS counselling in my area - it was from a national charity and so was expensive. Coupling this with the instability of my mental health - it was equally costly when I couldn't go, as I had to pay for cancelling appointments too.\\n\\nIt's been a year and a half, and still the emotions feel fresh and the pain, so intense. I lost my best friend, and my girlfriend - a woman I grew up with. The unbearable pain makes me feel like the only way out is...suicide.\\n\\n**My question is: what can I do to help myself out of this dilemma?** \\nI'm turning to you, the strangers of the internet, because I am running out of options and I am desperate to rid myself of these things hanging over me. I know I took for granted the time and love she gave me, and I will regret that for the rest of my life. But I don't want her back, I just want to rid myself of these...these ghosts that haunt me.

Approximately 8/9 years ago, (around when I was 12 years old) I had an emotional incident that left me clawing at my face until I bled. This led me to believe I was a fundamentally broken person and I would inevitably become some kind of violent psychopath who was, not to put too fine a point on it, evil.\\n\\nBecause of this self image, 3.5 years ago I had a breakdown in my year 13 final exams. I've since come to terms with my irrational beliefs. I know that I'm not a monster.\\n\\nBut that hasn't helped me. Since then I've had no job, no future, no career, no regular social contact outside of my family. I'm a parasite, feeding of my family or the government.

I can't fight the emptiness. I can't stand hating myself. I can't stand hating every passing day. I can't stand knowing that I'm better off than so many people yet I'm still here feeling sorry for myself. I don't know if I'm lazy or cowardly or just a complete and total failure.

I was homeless at the time and crashing on couches, and I went to college because I had to. I went to art school because I was deeply depressed and had developed no other interests and hobbies or cared about any other field of study.  \\n\\nBeing passively suicidal meant I didn't care about my studies and my body. \\n\\nI didn't care about my life, my health. \\n\\nI didn't develop any interest in college, either. I can't remember large chunks of it because I was disassociated most of the time. \\n\\nBeing passively suicidal means that I haven't gotten treatment for my mental illness until it was too late.\\n\\nMy artwork was half-assed because I felt like I was dragging an animated corpse around. \\n\\nI'm just starting to care about my life, and it's too late. \\n\\nBecause I chose to live while wanting to die, my life is a shell of what it's supposed to be.\", \"I am planning to suicide tonight.

', 'Why was I a suicidal child Writing down my lead up and recovery as a suicidal child...\\n\\nChildhood Part One 0-June 2007 (incomplete)  \\nAshley and Mackenzie did gymnastics for as long as I can remember, Rochelle would take them directly after school and no one would be back until I was in bed. I dont remember there ever being a night during the week this didnt take place. I had basically no human contact unless I was at school or on the weekends, but even then during the designated times I was allowed out of my room I tried to stay away from everyone, which didnt work  \\nI remember sitting in my closet bawling my eyes out wondering why I couldnt go to Mackenzie’s birthday party and thinking “what did I do????” I had never been to Chuckie Cheese, the family and her friends were there. Didnt anyone care? Where did the family think I was? Didnt anyone question it?  \\nI remember it was my birthday, which was never a celebrated day so I didnt expect anything, I was sweeping the hallway as usual which was one of my daily chores. I was at the end of the hallway standing in front of the mirror which was also a door into the attic, Rochelle came out right next to me, for no reason stared at me and said “You are the spawn of the Devil, why would we celebrate today” and that statement has stuck in my head and replays every birthday since.   \\nI remember I still had bunkbeds in my room so it was probably 2nd or 3rd grade,it was a school day, I cant remember if I threw up on my pillow during the night or if it was in the morning. I was waiting until I was allowed downstairs (I had to stay in my room unless it was during a designated time of the day) but I finally went downstairs and knocked on Rochelle’s bedroom door but there was no answer so I left a note explaining the situation in my room and went to wait the 20 minutes at the end of the driveway for the school bus. I waited so long outside because I was so terrified of missing it because I knew I would get screamed at and hit and then probably made to walk to school. I came home and had expected my bedding to be washed while I was away but it was still there and the note was gone. I didnt know how to wash bedding so I flaked off the dried throw up and continued with my life  \\nI remember I was older, and had to use the restroom so badly but it wasnt my time to leave my room but I couldnt wait so I went downstairs and knocked on the bathroom door (we only had one and Rochelle was using it), there was no answer so I ran back upstairs so I wouldnt get in trouble for lingering downstairs. I made it back into my room but I couldnt hold it and peed my pants. It got on the floor of course, I changed my clothes and then went back downstairs when it was my time. I knocked on the door again but again no answer. I left a note again explaining the situation and asked how to clean it. I came home and there were cleaning products in my room but the mess was still there, but every morning after the bathroom was empty and I remember being so thankful  \\nI remember standing in the kitchen, it was one of the times she decided all three of us were a problem, Mackenzie was being screamed at and then all of a sudden Mackenzie was flying across the room  \\nI remember there being a sit-down between Rochelle, my dad, Ashley and I to discuss how Ashley felt uncomfortable that I would “look” into her room while she talked to me from the doorway or when I would walk by. My dad defended me on that one but Im pretty sure thats when Ashley got a lock that she utilized whenever she was or wasnt in the room. I never actually cared what her room looked like, I was just gazing around when I would walk by or she stood in the doorway if she happened to say something to me  \\nI remember at one point my dad had me keep a journal everyday while he was away for work, I cant imagine Rochelle wanted it but she had no logical reason to disagree. So I kept that journal. He had told me to talk about my day, what I ate, things you would jot down as a normal person except that I lived with Rochelle in that hell hole. My journal entries were 1 to 2 sentences saying I went to school, did my homework and chores and then ate jelly on Wonderbread for dinner. Man was there yelling the next time Dad came home and read that because how dare I lie and try to make Rochelle look bad because of course she was home every evening making dinners for all of us. Thinking about it I wonder what was happening that I didnt know about for my dad to single me out and think a journal was the solution. Did he notice I wasnt included in family phone calls? Did he think I didnt like him and didnt want to talk to him? Did he realize I was a depressed and suicidal child?  \\nI remember my dad was out of town working and wanted the three of us to make him a Christmas List. Either I didnt feel worthy of gifts or Rochelle or the other two said something but either way I didnt make one. Ashley and Mackenzie gave him theirs, over the phone and when it was my turn, of course I said nothing. There was yelling from Rochelle of course because I had one thing to do and I couldnt even do it so I think I said art supplies or something.  \\nI remember the first time I ever felt as if I was going to pass out I was standing behind the fancy chair in the upstairs landing and Rochelle was going on and on and I was going in and out of blacking out. I had gotten so good with my indifference face that her and my dad couldnt even tell. Probably why I over animate everything now because I was such a shell  \\nI remember every summer all summer for as far back as I can remember Rochelle would cut the grass using the riding lawn mower and I would hand rack all of the clippings. All 2 acres of it. By the time I finished she would be recutting it so it was a never ending cycle and insane blisters and long long long days. Im honestly surprised I dont have any scars and I think about this part of my life whenever Im sweeping or see anyone raking the grass. It was during one of these instances I had my first thought of running away. I had a diary, I thought it was private, and I would make supply lists for what I thought I should bring. I would trace my tears that would fall on the pages. I realized my diary wasnt private once I copied down a poem I saw on the wall of my elementary, It was only about 4 lines and talked about a house being a home and family. I then re-wrote the poem in my own words and basically stated how this house was not a home and these people were not a family. It was very soon after that I got brought down for a talk between my dad and rochelle. Of course at the age of whatever I didnt have the courage to speak up about what was making me feel this way, especially knowing rochelle would deny deny and nothing but extra punishment would come out of it. It cant of been long after that I jumped from wanting to run away to wanting to kill myself and make it easier for everyone. I decided I would take all the pills I could find in the house, pretty sure thinking back we most likely only had tylenol and other OTC nonsense. I thought about doing this for so long, and I finally picked a day but that same day I decided when I would do it was the same day rochelle announced by dad was coming back home for a visit. I always felt a little better after he left and it reminded me that it wouldnt be easier for him if I left. Chicken Soup for the Soul was big at my school then and I remember there were stories that reminded me that suicide is selfish and I may not have to feel the hurt anymore, but other people would. People I cared about.  \\nI remember I started reading the Harry Potter series around the time I was seriously considering suicide. Instead of killing myself, I read and created a world in my head. I could escape into a universe that was completely make-believe, where there was a boy struggling in a “family” that didnt want him, but was able to find a family of his own.  Rochelle figured out I was thoroughly enjoying Harry Potter and took it from me. I remember she ripped out pages from several of my books, one of them being the fifth harry potter and I told her it was a loan from my schools library. I prayed the librarian wouldnt notice and she didnt because I never heard anything. She did however rip out chapters from my complete works of The Chronicles of Narnia my dad had bought me. I’ve still never re-read them or re-purchased or even want to look at them.   \\nI remember when I was in elementary school I finished a book Rochelle had checked out for me from the public library, something she would do while my dad was home because she had to act like the caring helpful mother. I happened to finish the book quicker than either of them would have expected, they didnt believe I actually had so took it from me and stated they would now read it and quiz me. Being completely honest I dont remember them actually following through, which is actually annoying now come to think of it. I would have passed with flying colors.  \\nI feel very heavy talking about this. I feel like there is a weight holding me down, sitting on my chest. But I know I dont feel this way anymore, I havent for a very long time. Its therapeutic to finally type out my stories.   \\n\\n\\nIm much older now but I still have instances where I feel nothing. Im in therapy and finally typing this out and getting some of my story out into the world even if no one sees this feels like a lift off of my shoulders.

I have been struggling with performance anxiety and clinical depression since my first year in dental school. I failed in the 1st year which led to me getting 6 months drop from the original class I joined and later on I had to take another drop because of my father’s health conditions during covid time. And finally I was put in a regular batch where I made friends and was coping okayish. But unfortunately i failed 2 subjects in my final year and was given another drop of 6 months. \\nI failed oral pathology and periodontics. My 3rd year oral pathology HOD has been consistently downright mean to me and even passed negative comments regarding my father’s health issues and my mental health issues. She thinks I’m acting an elaborate play or faking things to gain sympathy. She didn’t sign my journal coz I took a drop from 3rd year finals during my father’s hospitalisation days and later on when I was promoted to 4th year she agreed to sign my journal certificate. Unfortunately whenever I went to her, she kept sending me back or asking me to do corrections required and I did what I was asked to do. I must have gone to her more than a dozen times back and forth. She would call me during times when I was in lecture or in OPD or whenever I went, she wasn’t in her cabin. When I had to go meet her post taking drops to sort things out in 3rd year, She passed insensitive remarks regarding my father’s health condition saying how can a person be sick for such a long time. My father was suffering from acute necrotising pancreatitis which led to 20% necrosis of his pancreas and all the complications related to it along with 12mm kidney stone which caused him immense pain and he was in ICU for a long time as he also has diabetes and high blood pressure. I brought all the relevant documents about my father’s health and asked her to make a note that I wasn’t simple missing her classes because I am not punctual but because I need to be there for my family. She rejected seeing the reports by saying “I don’t want to see all this.” I told her she can have a talk with my mother but she still did not accept that and she again said she doesn’t want to have any talk with my family. She looked at me like I was selling her some sob story and sent me away. But her comments regarding my father’s health and the way she looked at me, led me to attempt suicide because she made me feel like its better for me to disappear than ever show my face to her. I tried hanging myself and my mom found me in the room doing that. My room has a key lock and she had the keys. After that I cried a lot and it took me a long time to recover. I gave my 3rd year finals and passed 2 out of 3 exams. I failed her exams and wasn’t able to answer anything because looking at her in the exam hall triggered those memories of me trying to kill myself and everything she has done or said or how I cried pathetically during my father’s hospitalisation time. So I wasn’t able to deal with all that and failed the exam. In 4th year I sat for the KT she gave me in her subject. The day before my practical exams, I had a major panic attack where I suffered from terrible chest pains and was not able to breath properly and kept shivering. I was taken to the hospital and given IV and medication to calm down. I was in the hospital till the evening and barely had time to study for her practicals. This time I passed the theory exam but I was failed in the practical exams. She threw my answer paper on my face when the external asked me questions and asked me how was my theory paper. I was answering her and she saw the bruises I got from the IV, injections and blood tests they did the night before. And the external asked me about the same and when I told her honestly, the HOD lady lost her shit and threw the paper on my face saying how dare I go around tell others she failed me when I am not worth of passing. She thought I was trying to gain sympathy from the external. She has been mentally harassing me this way since past 1 year and so much that I have PTSD and seeing her triggers me. I also had a massive panic attack during my Periodontics practical exam and fainted. I failed that exam. \\nMy father went to have a talk with my dean of the college and asked him about how my exams will be taken. He met my college mentor who asked me to meet her. I met her today and she asked me to sit for the classes and then said how all my peers have becomes intern doctors and I am still in final year 1st term. \\nI came home and cried a lot. I felt its not worth living because I’ve been in a lot of mental pain since my first year of dental school. I have invested my whole teenage and everything to become a dentist and yet I keep getting slapped like this by my fate and made to struggle every single day. I am beyond heartbroken and depressed, if I get failed another time then I don’t know what I will do. The oral pathology HOD is responsible for passing people in practicals and if she fails me again I don’t know what to do. \\nMy parents tell me they understand my pain but they don’t. My father and I have regular fights about all this. I am so exhausted that even getting up from bed or closing my eyes feel draining. I have been constantly crying and dreaming about dying. \\nI don’t know how to cope or manage anything and I can’t even put an official complaint against her as I am worried she may take it personally and fail me again. But the things she made me go through deserves her to be reported in the college.

It\\'s not epilepsy. Just that, which in fact is not even a valid answer of what is happening, it\\'s just a ruling out of one thing. No more explanations, I think my family may have even started to believe it was an act, or at least consider it, that would explain the bad reactions, the shouting, the screaming, how dare you throw yourself to the floor in front of your granny, **you will kill her.** \\n\\n\\r  \\nAfter studying it and being really sure I told my psychiatrist, and she just said yeah, that might be, yeah, that it is.

And I was not prepared, I have seizures every time I’m stressed. So, my body had to stop me, my muscles stopped working, I couldn’t even write, had to go to physical therapy. but I did the test, and people still say that you can do it, after all you did the university test with all that adversity!! it was not adversity it was a destructive impulse, I wanted to die each and every day. But now I had a boyfriend, my best friend, and I love him and he helped me gain hope, and that hope is my torture, I gain hope for a future instead of a suicide, then I gained too much hope, maybe I can go to university like I always wanted, be an anthropologist!! and the first week was amazing, I had study many of the things they were teaching me in class now, so I was exhilarated, I was on a high. \\n\\n\\r  \\nAfter all, the university test was somewhat in uh, November early December, and then I had two months of bliss, I’ve never been as healthy and as good as that summer. I enjoyed so much; I was able to start actually healing. and now I’m nothing. \\n\\n\\r  \\nI love classes, I love them, I adore going and getting lectures about anything, and it was not just anything, but things I always was thinking and studying about, human behavior, archeology, sociology, the human mind and how we create our societies, and they were tackling racism, colonialism and sexism, I was static. Then the first homework assignment came, it was simple, it was just writing about something in a museum, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t, 6 hours till I had to send it I started writing, reading researching. The professor told me it was a great essay, and I was proud, but God, it was hard. but I already had two more essays to write, how the fuck I’m gonna do it, panic, anxiety, depression, seizures; and it was in groups of three, just as the last one, yet I did it alone bcs my two new acquaintances where dumb lazy men who thought they could just copy wikipedia then feed it to ChatGPT would make a real great essay. They were supposed to start doing one while I was doing and finishing one alone, I finish after struggling, not because of the subject, that’s the fucked up part, I tend to always have an idea bcs I been interested in this kinda shit since always, but my fill of bad shit of a brain was killing me, it didn’t let me write, get close to my computer, or even enjoy a break. \\n\\n\\r  \\nI already was losing classes, seizures bcs anxiety, but that would only mean that I had to study on my own, and I died, I think that was when my fate was sealed, it was obvious if you actually have an understanding of how my day to day is and how are the symptoms I experience. Third week, I couldn’t work. I can’t concentrate alone, I can’t, even when my boyfriend was by my side, I would only end up disappearing from reality and being trapped in the dark of my mind unable to move or scape the feelings that were crawling inside. I had to ask for help, there was a part of the university that helped disable students like me, they told me I had to start doing the paperwork, and it wasn’t until I was responding one of the questioners used as a tool of the day-to-day capacity of the person that I realized how fucked I always had been. \\n\\n\\r  \\nI can’t bathe, can’t sleep, cannot go alone outside, will not eat and will not move even if I feel hungry, can’t go to pee the great majority of times which causes pain, yet I won’t get up because I simply can’t, I can’t adhere to schedules or follow one, I can’t concentrate, can’t handle conflict, can’t even use public transport. If it wasn’t for my 82-YEAR-OLD granny, I wouldn\\'t eat or bathe. \\n\\n\\r  \\nAnd to make matters worse I fucked more my life when I decided to continue last semester, the high quantity of traumatizing attacks ended up giving me headaches of an 6-8 level of pain in a scale of 10.

She used to tell me in my seizures, if you are like this in third year what will you do in fourth, what will you do in college. And she’s right, she didnt said an statement directly but those questions are, if you continue like this you won’t be able to do shit, there will be nothing for you, and her voice is so intertwined with my own thoughts, and even more when lately better people have asked me what will be of me, what I will work in, what will I do to get money, what will be of me when my mother cannot take care of me, why am I a fucking parasite in everyone’s life it’s what I end up asking in my head. I want to die, yet I want to believe in a future with the best boys that have ever lived aka my pretty boyfriend, I used to want to be an anthropologist, I still want to, I still wish, but I think there only be wishes for me. \\n\\n\\r  \\nWhat will you do in real life?

This was a trigger for the mental health issues i was diagnosed with 11 years ago in the first place. This has been effecting every aspects of my life since then. I am trying to understand this for years now but still haven't find any explanation. Its like the analytical part of my brain has some sort of association with my anxieties. The words or sentences i read (try to memorize) gets repeated in my mind subconsciously which makes me suffocated and its difficult to fall asleep and i keep waking up in the middle of the night with these words repeating themselves. I have no control over it. Just memorizing or rote learning stuff activates my social anxiety which manifests as me unable to make eye contact with people and thereby affecting my social life.

And I also feel really dumb for feeling social anxiety from 18-19 year olds. \\n\\nI’m also in a significantly different place in life. I’m in a long term relationship, and I have priorities etc. they’re all in their young hoe phase and they’re very strongly opinionated which isn’t wrong but also another factor why I have trouble relating. \\n\\n\\nThe hard part is, we’ve gotten into a habit (from the first few weeks of getting to know eachother) of leaving classes together and I feel awkward just ditching them to sit with other classmates. Unfortunately I think it’s this precedence that put me in this position, I’m just super friendly and we all got along at first! \\n\\nToday I made the choice and I sat at a different table in the library so that I can focus on my work, while they sat at another.

This past few years were definitely the hardest on me. Ever since I turned 20 (now 24) I have only been confronted with situations that made my anxiety spiral. I try to challenge myself in life but by trying new things I actually just end up giving up on it beause it puts a terrible strain on me. For example wanting to do volontary work abroad, university studies, trying a new workplace or I tried to own a pet twice now but due to terrible anxious reactions I had to give them back after a few days. My anxiety manifests by having terrible stomach pain that makes me vomit and prevents me from sleeping days on end, it continues with panic attacks, diarrhea, weight loss and so on. Everytime I start to challenge myself I have to cancel that experience in order to lessen my anxiety again, but at the same time I miss on so many opportunities I desperately want to achieve. This pain is really becoming unbearable and I feel like I am putting a big strain on my family. Especially due to this recent event of adopting a kitten and now being able to take care of it because my overthinking is turning me incredibly sick. I am aware that the act is terrible and I have put my family through unnecessary pain. I feel like a monster that is a huge burden to others and it‘s really getting worse as time goes on. I am in psychotherapy, have visited psychiatrists before and have been prescribed xanax. I am feeling like a failure and really need some guidance on how to handle this.', 'How to comfort friend with Depression/Anxiety? Hi.

I know this year has been hard for me, and I knew I wouldn’t be ok, but my anxiety has resurfaced a lot of past trauma involving SA.\\n       This man has been the only person I have ever trusted with my entire being. I have never been so comfortable around someone, nor felt the amount of love and care we share for each other. We have been intimate many times before, and we have never had issues before. Sure I would have doubts every once in a while that he was just using me for sex, but I would be able to push it away and enjoy our intimate time together, as I know he is much better than those from my past.  \\n        Recently though, it’s like my brain just blocks him off.

Hi I\\'m 30M, I recently started dating this wonderful girl, I wasn\\'t aware she is taking depression and anxiety meds (nor is it a problem for me, as I\\'m fully aware it\\'s an illness).  Some backstory:\\n\\nShe is a MD I\\'m a DDS, we met because in my country we have to do 2 years of internship in public hospitals, it was almost instant and as we went on more dates, she felt secure and opened enough to tell me abut her situation. She came aware of her state because she finished a 4 years relationship some 2 years prior and she wasn\\'t feeling herself, being in the medical field she was finally diagnosed, she is taking meds and is really serious about her appointments and schedule, she told me she is feeling SO MUCH BETTER, but sometimes she has her ups and downs and I reassured her I\\'m here for the long run as I really really like her and wanna see her shine as I know she can.\\n\\n1 week ago, we were on a date, I left her in her apt, when I arrived home she told me she was starting to feel bad (headaches, bellyaches, general discomfort, tired all the time, etc.) we tried to pin point the cause to no avail, I suggested making an early appointment with her psychiatrist, maybe the dosage needed to be changed, or the pills weren\\'t making effects? Idk. \\n\\nToday she had her appointment and basically her psychiatrist told her that she was still getting over the mourning period of her past relationship, that she is having an anxiety exacerbation period, she don\\'t properly assimilate very well the changes in her life and in the country (our country is currently on a 2 week country-wide strike), that she is somatizing among other things... She basically told her to take things calmly and not to rush because the important thing is that she feels calm and that she is able to resolve things calmly (nothing wrong with that honestly I was really expecting those news), I told her that I was here to help and she could lean on me as much as she needs because relationships aren\\'t 50/50, sometimes you gotta give 80, 90 or 100% so your partner can get better, she cried and said she was lucky, etc. \\n\\nBut she then said that she was sorry for what was about to come, so I braced to impact. Regarding relationships, she told her that right now is not a good time since it requires a lot of energy and effort for things to go well and that if she is not well, she cannot give what is needed from her. Of curse I told her I understood and I was here to help in whatever form she needed, she ask if we could still be friends as her family doesn\\'t really bite into her \"illness\" and they see it more an inconvenience of she being a \"millennial\", she told me she wants to get back together when she feels better, but she is well aware it could take time, and that she wouldn\\'t take it on me if I decided to see someone new (I rejected her offering of course), at the end, we decided to keep seeing each other as she told me she really want to confide in me and help her get through this.\\n\\nSO I WANT TO KNOW: How can I help her in this situation?  \\n1) Of course giving her the space she need if crucial.  \\n2) I\\'ve read many articles regarding mental health and the positive reinforcement that a healthy relationship can bring to the betterment of the psych.  \\n3) She confessed to me that anytime that we were in a date all her aches, anxieties etc would disappear, so in my eyes, going back to just being friends would negatively impact her psych, I\\'m not saying that we should keep moving forward with the relationship and meet her parents, get married, but I\\'m perfectly good with pausing it as we are right now, because if seeing each other as a couple makes her feel better, then why stop? We could just keep as we are, and when she feels better we can continue, but treating her as a friend would get complicated as she told me she has MEANINGFUL feelings for me.  \\n4) I guess talking to her about point #3 would be good for both of us, because be kinda brushed over it, but I wanna know if anyone is going through something like this, or went through or knows someone who did, etc...  \\n5) Any recommendations would be VERY APPRECIATED.', 'Scared, Depression, Anxiety about the future?

Basically throughout my whole life Ive been stepped on, and left behind, during my elementary I had straight As but the problem was I got bullied, still not sure why, maybe because I am cringe or something, didnt have any friends or stuff, everyone knew me as a dumb, or rather autistic person. Everyone In my vicinity was thinking even if i hadnt met them that i am weird in some way, so stereotypes, anyways I got through that period. Next, or lets say a new period, i tried making some new friends in a new school and i fortunately did, i got 2 real bff, and like 6 friends. Like i must say that even though i have so many they all think i am a little off. To add on top of that during my life, ive always loved weird stuff, or as my parents say retarded stuff that no one else does. They complain how I am not as other kids. Complaining how I cant find anything normal. To be specific I liked electronics when i was younger. But there are two possible outcomes, I push so hard on my parents to let me do something to the point of their exhaustion, but it takes quite a bit of time, or i get rejected in the most awkard way possible. For example as i already said being called weird, not normal, mentally ill, etc. All of that as well as how I should go to gym, do some worthy stuff, etc. Well u might say this is some normal talk, right? no! I ACCEPT THEIR RUDE TALKING, and i listen i go to the gym all my friends told me to go, my parents a few months ago, and I go. I really like going to the gym,  although i am skinny (almost anorexic), i gain nothing, i start taking proteins, anyway, i got in argument with parents, proteins are bad they say, I try to explain that they are all natural... But they persist, i give up and dont go to the gym anymore. Partially cause of them, cause of my weight, and school stuff. My grades have went down a little. And i wanna fix them. Now few months pass again, I tried hobby number (3000, lol) 2, pyrotechnics, although dangerous, i learned a lot over the course of a few months and met some great people on the internet. They didn't allow me, i can kinda understand them, but they should know that i am still 19 and i believe i am responsible enough for most stuff. But the problem lies there, they reject me nicely first, but i kinda persist cause like why wouldnt i do something i like, and i get called everything after that. I also usually forget stuff pretty fast, my brain's coping mechanism. Third hobby again, i wanna do electronics  (220v) and low voltage stuff too. But again same things happen as always, get yelled, and lose hope. But by far one of the most things that hurt me is I wanna become a developer, but since my bro does very bad in school, they break the computer  or ban it from time to time. Also i get yelled at for using the computer too much, even though i only do 2 hours of programming. Not to forget i always get yelled at for something what he does even if i did nothing wrong. \\n\\nWhat would u recommend me, i need some advice, my head hurts from repetitive stress?\\n\\nI dont do bad at school, I do average\\n\\nSorry for my bad english and for every [i] I didn't capitalize.\", \"Somebody's unexpected death has really triggered my existential anxiety.

I also suffer from anxiety attacks and backslide when trying to make my life better. My childhood trauma had a negative impact on my mental state as an adult and I’d like to share my stories because no one irl would want to listen. \\n\\n•STORY 1: \\n\\nWhen I was a kid, my parents would beat me. I was in the wrong I’ll admit, but the punishments were too much. My punishments ranged from mild slaps in the face, belt whippings, and even punches/kicks. My body would be covered in red marks and bruises if I get in trouble in school or get a bad grade. My parents would scream at me to “shut the fuck up” if I cried at all and I’d get hit more. They told me to wear long sleeves and pants to school to cover it up. \\n\\nOne time in 3rd grade I was crying alone in the classroom while everyone else was in recess. The teacher asked why I was crying and I told her my legs and thighs hurt and showed her the belt laceration marks I got the night before. The teacher hugged me tight and I cried so violently I vomited on her but she didn’t mind. \\n\\nThe teacher called Child Protective Services on my parents the same day and the Agent said they’re coming in a week to investigate. In that week, my parents fear mongered me into thinking foster families and orphanages are worse and my young, stupid mind believed them. They never hit me in that week and my wounds healed, so the Agent had no evidence to take me away. My parents mellowed out as they got older, but my mom would continually tell me shit like “you’re a failed abortion, you should thank me you’re alive right now”. \\n\\nLater on they told me they’d never hit my sister because she’s a girl and girls should be treated with care. Those words made me so fucking angry. Just because I’m a boy, you can treat me like garbage? Just because I’m a boy, you can hit me? Just because I’m a boy, I don’t deserve love? \\n\\n•STORY 2:\\n\\nWhen I was 9 years old, I made a male friend and we had fun playing during recess. One time, he confessed he liked me. I didn’t know what to say and he forcefully kissed me and touched my genitals through my pants. I couldn’t fight back because I was a very small kid. It happened for a week, but that was already enough to kill my self confidence. I understand he must be going through some stuff at home to even think about doing this, but I still hate him. \\n\\nI was hesitant to tell my parents or teachers because I was scared no one would take me seriously and just make fun of me and call me gay. I never told anyone I know in person this story because they’ll lose respect for me and think I’m a joke.\\n\\nSTORY 3:\\n\\nMy first relationship was terrible. It started off well, until I opened up about my feelings. She told me she dislikes unconfident men. I was called insecure, a mental wreck, and that she lost all interest in me. I ended a 1 year relationship in 1 hour. All because I decided to stop this facade of a confident man and tell her more about myself. I closed my heart and never dated again from there. She taunted me after our breakup saying she fucked other guys and told me the details. I immediately shut her down and never talked to her again.\\n\\nAFTERTHOUGHTS:\\n\\nI am depressed.

The solution that puts me at ease is suicide, but I still have this sliver of motivation to make my life better.\\n\\nI started working out, going fishing, bought myself a dog, but my past follows me like a dark shadow and I feel like time is counting down to the point I can’t take it anymore and I go through with ending it all.', 'physical activity bonded trauma has been holding me back for years as my current depressive episode progresses, i’m also thinking through way more things than i used to when i’ve been feeling a bit better.\\ni haven’t shared below described problem with anyone, not even my therapists. not on purpose, i just thought i’ll be able to deal with it myself.\\nhowever i don’t think im able to do much about it, and i finally got the courage to try to reach for help.\\n\\nsince i was a kid i was facing a lot of pressure from my family, friends and teachers. i wasn’t the skinniest kid, and later on i became overweight. at the worst point i was 202lbs/91kg, of course it’s not the end of the world, but to me it was scary, crossing the 200lbs mark.\\ni was the heaviest child in the family, my cousins and siblings were thin and sporty, and the never ending comparison quickly became my biggest struggle.\\nit was being pointed out by my grandma, and mom. whenever i would make myself breakfast or join the family dinner, they would instruct me to eat more healthy things, avoid anything fat, sugary, ‘unhealthy’. on family gatherings i was supposed to skip the birthday cake, skip the pizza, i had my own salad prepared to eat, while looking at everyone else enjoying themselves. in their opinion even nuts as a snack would make me overweight and it was forbidden for me to touch them.\\n\\nmy grandma would send me on dieting retreats and buy me books on dieting and fasting. she would always tell me ‘if you don’t control your eating habits, you’ll end up with diabetes, just like me’.\\n\\nsince i was a kid i was slouching because i was so ashamed of my body, it became yet another nightmare of mine. i had to stay after classes at school for a special period for kids with spine problems. it was embarrassing on its own, primary schoolers are merciless and things like that were considered weird. plus the teacher was one of the most scariest teachers at school. i don’t even remember why, but just being around her made me paralyzed with fear.\\nlater on in life my mom would take me to private physiotherapists, they would prescribe me exercises to do at home, i would be too embarrassed to do them in front of my mom, i would refuse and run away and in consequence my mom would beat me on the back yelling to do my stretching.\\n\\non top of that i was always forced to move more. i had obligatory minimum amount of hours per week i had to spend on physical activities.

The relatives family members mocked me for my studying habits and demotivated me for studying(academics workload) long hours. They pushed me into believing that I was abnormal and mocked me by saying that- \\'highly educated people in their village end up becoming a garbage collector\\'. They used to say that I ran away from my house( which was infact true) as my step- mom didn\\'t provide me enough food( partly true) and came to their place to eat. They used to make me feel so degraded,and I gradually lost respect for myself, my self worth and my self confidence. Even at the school I went to, the teachers had low standards and didn\\'t recognise my value, which caused me to progressively start doubting myself. \\nOn that fateful day, I was studying with books spread out all around me when I suddenly realised that I was struggling to grasp the sentences in the books I was reading. Also no matter how hard I tried to get away, I started to get a sharp, tingling sensation like a needle all over my head. I went down to the room where everyone was watching TV in comfort and attempted to understand what was written in that small book, but I wasn\\'t able to absorb the lines\\' meanings as well as I used to.\\nThe following day when I arrived at the classroom, they were displaying a presentation about pursuing a career in finance, but I was indifferent and started to despise everyone since I was so uncomfortable from a strong tingling feeling that seemed like a needle running across the top of my skull. Due to frequent insults like \"he is a senseless person,\" which came from individuals both at the relatives\\' home and from instructors and students at school, my personality was completely destroyed.\\nThe tingling, needle-like sensation went throughout my entire body, turning me from the once-intelligent, bright youngster into a hollow, dim-witted adult. Even though it has significantly lessened by this point, I am still dealing with that annoying tingling sensation. This is my entire, horrible story, which I deeply regret. Thanks for reading. Any other suggestions for reducing this grating tingling sensation would be greatly appreciated.', \"University Experience and Trauma I graduated from uni 2 years ago with a degree that didn't get me into a job that I hoped it would. I forced myself to complete it because I thought I might ruin my career prospects. I don't have any friends from university, school, or sixth form and I feel sad because I don't have friends from the past to share memories with. I had to recently distance myself from my school friends because I put up with a lot of negative behavior for too long. There was a lot of emotional abuse that took place and I put up with it for too long because this person was my only friend for a while and they were like the sibling I didn't have when I was growing up. They told me that I am socially unaccepted amongst other things. I've struggled to socialize my whole life and was often called rude and shouted at by people because of this. I'm not sure how to be okay and move past this because I sometimes cry about these past memories.\", 'I think I have trauma A few years ago during the pandemic, I had to attend 5th and 6th grade online and my parents became stressed out from their work and became very distanced from me. I already had depression for a while, but it became so much worse. I was forced to take an online maths course that I didn\\'t understand because they wanted me to get honors in maths. I couldn\\'t complete the problems, and my mom would yell and scream at me until I cried, then tell me to stop crying. One time after this happened I ran to the bathroom and drank a quarter of a small glass of hand soap, expecting to die. When I didn\\'t, it was one of the most horrifying feelings I\\'ve ever felt, like falling into a pit of molten lava and realizing you can\\'t die for some reason. At that point, school became very stressful for me and my parents started talking to me about that as well. After a point, I just stopped attending school but pretended I was so my parents wouldn\\'t notice. I would hide in my room and the bathroom sometimes and just sleep on the floor, but my parents unscrewed the locks so there was nowhere I could lock myself away. I ended up attending only a few of my 5th and 6th grade classes. I completed that course after a year (9 months longer than it was supposed to take) but I didn\\'t get honors, so it didn\\'t even matter.  \\n\\n\\nAfter I got diagnosed and hospitalized from my 3rd suicide attempt at the end of 6th grade being caught by my school monitoring my search history, my parents became a lot nicer and said they didn\\'t realize how I felt. I recovered from my missed education, but never recovered a solid schedule of sleep or work. I became severely underweight and whenever I even think about anything I used to enjoy before 6th grade I hate myself. Whenever I think about that math course I tried doing I want to kms. I keep hearing everybody at my school talking about all their accomplishments, that\\'s all they can talk about. I hate myself because I have Ds and Cs in all my classes, at least no Fs, but nobody cares.\\n\\nI took too many off days and now I can\\'t take any more or else we will be investigated by truancy officers. My friends don\\'t want to talk to my about my problems. My parents are also in better places and try to help me, but they don\\'t understand either. My parents at least try to understand depression as extreme sadness constantly, but they don\\'t understand the other effects it has on my life besides that. All I can do is play video games because I don\\'t want to think about anything else. My parents signed me up for therapy for a year, but it didn\\'t work. They don\\'t want me to take meds, they want me to find alternate solutions first. There are none. Time feels strange, everything lasts so much longer than it should. I stay awake for days at a time. I wear a face mask all the time because I\\'m ugly.  don\\'t eat food during school lunch, I just sit with my head down and if anybody asks if I\\'m alright I just say \"I\\'m good\" because if I explain I\\'m depressed all they will say is \"I\\'m sorry.\"  \\n\\n\\nI want to be dead but I don\\'t want to die. Whenever my school counselor tried to help, I only got the most generic advice like \"join a club.\" I did, none of the clubs are good because there is no moderation and its only friend groups talking with each other, groups that I\\'m not part of. My parents will keep saying \"You have so much life ahead of you its not all gone\" but it is.   \\n\\n\\nIf you happen to see this specific sentence, please how do I get out of this how come nothing works, its been too many years, when I talk with somebody I don\\'t feel any emotion all my reactions are on autopilot I barely remember what happiness feels like', 'Got my first A in years + Religious trauma    I even had a dream the night before the result for the last test was submitted that I  logged on and saw an A. \\n\\nAnd I did. Yet it didn\\'t phase me. I\\'m relieved and glad. The course was interesting and easy as well. \\n\\nActually, college wise, I actually improved. Yet I started feeling increasingly worse on the inside. Nothing in particular happened. Yet I had like a breakdown crying to no end until 5am and oversleeping and waking up numb. It\\'s not an uncommon occurrence. But each time it feels new. \\n\\nI want to be normal. I want everything on the inside to be normal. I wish I was normal. But instead, deep down I know I\\'ll die alone with unresolved mommy/daddy/God issues. No one is this warped.\\n\\nThat\\'s my biggest concern. I feel like God hates me. For regular people, it\\'s like he\\'s not even real. But my whole life was just this religion. I was abused using this religion, yet I held on. My whole psyche just flipped over when I realized they only raised me in this religion because it placed them on a pedestal. And no one from among the clergy is helping. I myself am considered some higher clergy-esqe scholar like figure by the people around me irl due to graduating a seminary and I feel like after all these years studying all the sacred texts I was given access to there was no answer. My peers refuse to help nor acknowledge  what happened. Instead I was blamed for not being a better daughter and viewing my abusive (who nearly killed me more than once through physical abuse) parents as an enemy. Even online when I  anonymously try to address it I get either backlash for my doubts or met with some weak, \"emotional\", self interpretation fluff with no solid, hard text. I tried talking to a therapist who is from my community but it seems like she didn\\'t receive as much religious education on the whole  exegesis deconstruct word by word in the original language level that it seems I put her in doubt instead. \\n\\nMy religion says nothing specifically about parents abusing their kids- in the texts.There is no punishment for it either. What kind of justice is it where the rights of those in authority are more emphasized than the rights of those under responsibility? The ones in authority doing just the basics are as if they did some astronomical great deed? Wouldn\\'t this obviously encourage the inflation of egos and abuse (if it\\'s even considered abuse) of those in their responsibility? \\n\\nI feel overwhelmed with a distressing amount of confusion. God witnessed all of this. He knows about all of this to the most minute of detail. That it is bound to happen. That this isn\\'t uncommon behavior and is often overlooked by humans yet he didn\\'t address it. \\n\\nI feel like I was punched. Because most who know about him and believe in him and love him, love him for who and what he exactly is. But it\\'s like he won\\'t love me back unless it\\'s through obeying my parents, husband, and pushing out a kid; not being my happy and comfortable self- and meanwhile my brother can just do so many things himself and it\\'s directly to God. But if I do the things he does, those are just unnecessary for me and it\\'s always better and a priority that I in be in those positions instead despite it making it very easy for me to be abused or degraded:  just because the previously mentioned is not befitting for me as I am a woman. It\\'s like the only way would be for me to be an unmarried orphan with untraceable relatives. \\n\\nI wanted God to love me because it feels like no one else will know me inside to this degree and love me, but my heart just shatters at the text saying \"God\\'s happiness lies in the parents\\' happiness and his anger lies in their anger.\" They were always angry with me. Nothing ever made them happy. Only that which caused me pain both physically and mentally appeased them. \\n\\nAnd it just makes me mad. My whole life so far was spent on him, my heart was spent on him. He\\'s always on my mind (unlike what others think, its not such a holy and uplifting experience.) He knows that not just me but others like me will exist/existed and he never addressed such a basic issue? Why? Does our pain not matter to him? Or are we that insignificant to him compared to those put in positions over us as it\\'s his way of showing favor to them by placing them there. \\n\\nAccording to our principles, silence is approval. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m just devastated. I can\\'t even bring myself to pray. I just keep feeling sore pain in my chest with all these constant bouts of breakdowns. I feel all messed up. On the inside is all this,  and outside irl it\\'s like I\\'ve been programmed to jump straight to feeling and acting defensive for it. I can\\'t budge.\\n\\nI don\\'t even want a sign or anything of that sort of thing. I wanted an actual clear-cut text and there was none. And I just feel so stuck because mentally he is my reality. I can sense his presence. All of it is just completely real to me and on the other hand is all this. I just want to rip my heart out and shred it to pieces so it no longer has the ability to feel. It hits damagingly when I realize, it\\'s possibly because he doesn\\'t care. Like, oh wow, he doesn\\'t (possibly) care for what I\\'ve been through. I feel my life and all this pain that I\\'ve been throughout the whole of it was just a waste and yet he let it happen...\\n\\nI want my parents to go to hell and rot there for eternity. Is that too aggregious to want? I don\\'t want my heart \"changed\" to like them and forget everything in the hereafter. I want vengeance and I want to be guaranteed that. I\\'ll even exchange my hereafter in the sense of ceasing to exist.

After talking to a therapist and doing some research, I found out I suffer emotional trauma from childhood emotional neglect. \\n\\nGrowing up, my parents did a good job providing my sis and I with our basic needs. Food, shelter, and clothing. But not so much our mental needs. My mother is a narcissist and my father is her enabler and also kind of narc too. They had a very dysfunctional marriage. It got violent sometimes. But they often took out their anger at each other on my sister and me. \\n\\nThis explains a lot of why I live in such a painful existence. Through the childhood neglect, my mind learned that I didn’t matter. And so as I got older, my brain was rewired to think this by default about myself, and I lived life accordingly. This ended up with me developing trauma habits and side effects. People pleasing, not taking feedback well, inability to self love or accept love, insomnia, fatigue, irritability. \\n\\nThe people pleasing one is serious. They’ll be times where I’ll do something nice for someone, and I’m not sure why I did it. And then the person would look at me like I just did something weird. I subconsciously do this in hopes to get love in return. I was taught by my upbringing that love is conditional and I must perform in order to receive it. Which is why I developed that habit. \\n\\nI struggle with crippling loneliness. It often times keep me up crying at night. Over obsessing over if I’m good enough to live in this world. This is because I have self love issues. Because childhood neglect taught me that my feelings and needs weren’t important, my mind by default doesn’t see me as lovable. Which is why self care was also always a struggle for me too. I always feel guilty whenever I do something nice for myself. \\n\\nBut this just goes back to the inability to accept feedback. People always think it’s the negative feedback that’s the hardest to take, but for people like me who have emotional trauma, it’s actually the positive feedback that’s the hardest. Even though we don’t like negative feedback, it at least feels familiar to us due to the often negative feedback I received as a child. This made me develop a habit of self criticism and self sabotage. I’m an art student, and critiques from my classmates and professors are very common. But I did notice a weird common occurrence that happens during critiques. When it’s my turn to explain my work, I tend to be me very critical of my own work. So much that my professor sometimes has to stop me and reassure me. My classmates always gave me concerned looks after moments like this. I didn’t think much of it before I found out trauma makes me do that. \\n\\nI think the saddest habit though is the inability to accept positive feedback. I wasn’t self aware of it but I get nervous whenever someone shows interest in me or gives me a compliment. This is actually the part that makes it hard for me to accept love. Because love counts as positive feedback. Positive feedback gives me dysphoria that feels like guilt. Like I accidentally tricked someone into liking me, or into thinking that I’m capable. Or like they’ll find out how lame I really am and be disappointed. This affects my dating life. I’ve had to turn down a few people due to them showing interest in me. Whenever they show signs of liking me, I get very nervous and try distancing myself from them. My trauma only made me use to people who abuse me, not love me. This also makes me question my friends a lot. They’re always having to remind me that they enjoy me and want me in their lives, but it makes me feel bad whenever they say things like that. Because my trauma convinced me they would be better off without me. \\n\\nBut yeah that’s what I’ve been learning. I’m hoping this means I can heal now. Maybe this would help some of you guys. \\n\\nI’m just tired of my existence being agony.', 'inside the mind of a 17 Year old boys (trauma induced) depressive thoughts The plan here is im just gonna type away, until I feel like I cant anymore, or I\\'ve gotten my point across.\\n\\nReading this over, I\\'m not the greatest writer, so a key detail here is that my mom and dad split up when i was like 2 years old, they had split custody of me at the time. bear with me here, thank you.\\n\\nI have gone to therapy, but they consistently tell me to do pointless, pointless things. Like going to bed early, getting a full 8-9 hours in, I have tried it, but I knew going into it that it would never work. I have had depression for the last 2 years, but I never thought about it or had it diagnosed officially until a month ago. When I was 8 years old, roughly, it was a wednesday morning, 3:30 AM on a school morning when I woke up suddenly. It was abnormal of me to wake up at this hour and I really needed to go to the bathroom. My apartment at the time had 2 bathrooms, one of which was farther from my room, and smaller which i didnt like. for whatever reason, I was drawn to the bathroom I didnt like. I walked in, and there she was. My mom. She had a belt wrapped around her low shoulder/high bicep area, a needle sticking out of her elbow, vomit, just, everywhere im telling you. Her veins were popping a harsh black, thick color and she was ferociously seizing, I was so confused, I had no idea what drugs were, let alone heroin or other insanely hard drugs like that. I thought for sure she was dying, I called 911 just crying, so unfathomably hard, telling them my mom is going to die, and I dont know whats going on, Im alone, now. My mom who I loved so, so much just might leave my life forever, so I thought at the time. She always told me she was \"sick\" and that the heroin scattered amongst the house was medicine. Anyway, the police got to my apartment building, Im up on the third floor and I have to buzz them into the building. **I didn\\'t know how.** So, there I was left with A gigantic decision. My mom was dying, do I stay with her with her for her last moments, or do I leave her, alone, in her vomit and blood, to get what might potentially save her life. After about 10 seconds, I put the phone down and I let them in, they rushed upstairs and when I got back she had stopped moving. I was certain she died. We called my grandma (me and a cop) to come pick me up and take me to her house. about 7 hours later I got a call from my mom, she was alive, and unwell. She told me how much she loved me, and how sorry she was, and she **PROMISED** she would make it up to me. I made the stupid decision to believe her. 1 month later she was back, \"healthy\" and out of rehab, but she was still using. Everything was back to normal, as my addict mom and my completely healthy dad battled in court for me, I was kept fully out of the loop, (which I now agree with) I was living back with my mom half the time, just me and her. Then after a month or so, I awoke on another school night. But this time it was different, things were breaking, alarms were ringing, smoke was pouring into my room, My house was on fire. I got up, left my room and looked into my kitchen, the whole thing was in flames, I was coughing up thick black smoke and couldnt see a thing. So, I did what I believed to be the best thing which was to go get my mom, I have to save my mom! right? I sprinted and swung her door open with my eyes watering, screaming, \"MOM! MOM PLEASE GET UP!\" repeatedly, only to soon realize she wasn\\'t there. I looked in the bathroom, I looked in the living room, even back in the kitchen. I couldnt find her. So I left, I went downstairs and out the building where everyone else was. I was sobbing, telling everyone my mom burned up, because thats what I truly thought. And then out of no where, like a movie, she appeared in the crowd, and it clicked. She had left me in there, I could have died in there, I looked for so, so long for my mom, whilst the whole time she was actively leaving to burn and die, alone in my room with my cat sweetie. (R.I.P SWEETIE <3) I just couldnt believe it. When I told my dad, it was over, he made the executive decision to ignore the law. He did everything in his power to keep my from my mom under any circumstance. My apartment with mom was inhabitable, so she moved in with the same grandmother that had picked me up that one wednesday morning. And **SOMEHOW** because my dad was breaking the law bound agreement to allow my mother to see me half the time, the court was siding with my mother in what would become a 3 year long custody battle. This whole battle im resenting my father for not allowing me to see my mom after the fire, whilst also being so sad that she left me there to die. But I forgave her quickly as a 8-9 year old boy. This whole battle, my grandma had also been facing a battle that I didnt know about, She would go on to die of lung cancer about a year later, December 23rd 2015. I truly loved her so, so much. Now, due to her death, my mom had no home, she kept using heroin, and was in and out of jail for petty theft charges constantly. My dad had finally won custody over me. Life was sad, but finally I didnt have to deal with all this shit going down all the time. Until I did again, because my grandma was a wealthy woman, she had left me a sum of money on her will for the day I turned 18 years old, which would now be in exactly 1 month and 1 day, this sum was $65,000. But unfortunately, I would find out 2 years ago at the age of 15 that because this will was last updated before my mother would become an addict, she would have the authority to hold this money for me. Im sure you can see where this is going... My mom did not save that money, she used all of it, every penny on heroin and other pointless things that she currently no longer has. It makes me feel so utterly useless. Am I really **THAT** invaluable to my own mother who I loved unconditionally? My dad and I were fighting because he used to never tell me the whole story about my mom, and my man was, well, not being remotely a mom. So I was so, so sad, I was in grade 10, covid was hitting, I couldnt see my friends, My mom was gone, and had ran away with my future education fund, and everything was terrible. Now I am 17, living with the sadness to this day. Every minor inconvenience in my life is detrimental to my mental health. I feel like life is a constant loop of pain, so it isnt worth getting out of bed to experience, I just want to curl up in a ball and lay there in my bed, completely silent, alone. I began cutting myself a week ago. Ever since then it has been calling me. It literally feels as if the razor blade that is currently in eyeshot, speaks to me, tells me that it can help me feel something. My arm is currently riddled with dry blood from the cutting I did moments before deciding I was going to type out this post. (I never use reddit) and university is coming, I got accepted into the UFV which is the cheapest, closest school in British Columbia to me. But I just cant go to school, I used to be a fantastic, lively student with good grades, I now average a 46% only maintaining a 79% in English 12 because I NEED it to graduate, and my dad would be devastated if I didnt graduate and became a failure after all the work he has done to get me to where I am now.

She claimed to be woke but, ended up cheating on me because my sick was small.\\n\\nTbf, objectively its not small based on the size charts and all that bullshit its average or above average but I still feel small. I tried having sex with someone and it was awful I felt so uncomfortable. \\n\\nOn top of that I had to do everything the other person just kind of laid their til it was over. \\n\\nI felt super gross and inadequate. I'm not necessarily small but I guess I'm like 2 inches above the average but that's only bone pressed I probably only have a few inches of usable length. The reason this has been such a big focus for me is the guy she cheated with was bigger. My truth is im roughly 6.5 inches nbp(7inch if you care about bp) usable length and 5.5 girth. Maybe I have only sqted size queens but I was so inadequate. Its insecurity and its not tied to my depression but it affects my interpersonal relationships\\n\\nI never knew what cuckholding was and not shaming anyone but she practically tried to make me a cuck. When I got upset about the whole thing she threatened to send him(guy she was cheating with and his friends who were fucking her) to beat me up. It was all really weird while telling me she loved me. \\n\\nShe violated my boundaries during sex and everything. The worst thing about it was I would literally have sex with her for hours. I would not get off and have to just jack off in the corner. the bjs wre toothy and shitty. (After we broke up and gave more guys stuff she was better I felt gross knowing how many people she's slept with)\\n\\nWorst part is my dumbass after everything tried to work it out. She then told me I wasn't a man(I have smaller balls due to trauma to my testicles at a young age). Tried to fuck me in the ass cause I didn't have a man's dick.\\n\\nIts embarrassing and shitty but I literally have no one to talk about this with like no one not friends not family saying anon shit that no one will read is the only thing that gives me comfort while I procrastinate on studying.\\n\\nI hate myself. I wish I hadn't lived to this point. \\n\\nI literally almost broke down the last time I had sex thinking about how gross i felt. So fucking worthless. I don't want to be a cuck but I realize I can't be with anyone and it sucks so much. The sweet nothings that people  tell you like its the motion of the ocean and shit don't matter if the girls need a big wave.\\n\\nI don't hate women either its not their fault its my fault for being a pathetic worthless small dicked loser. Im a spineless worthless coward. I may never be a man.\\n\\nFucked up my leg jumping onto a box today infront of a bunch of people at the gym. It was sok embarrassing. Its hard because I'm so ugly most girls don't like me. Also, my ex is right I'm a dad bodded, smalldicked, worthless, skinny legged, stupid, ugly, pathetic dumb fuck. I don't have self esteem because I don't deserve any.\\n\\nI am trying to find some self worth. But until I make 500k a year for a few years im never going to be anything. I hate that I spent time with her. \\n\\n\\nI have a therapist but he's terrible for trauma. All my trauma in life sucjs. R happened in my early years. Molested by bullies in middle school. Groped in highschool. Now I'm violated by my partner in college and its because I'm not a man even though she told me im a crazy person and she hopes all her sleeping around doesn't make me kill myself. She was hoping I died. Its gross. Same with my therapist.\\n\\n\\nThe new girl is an fwb but its roughly the same. Shes nice but is always being so awkward. Idk man.\\n\\nBeing a guy is tough too. Women think its all fun and games. No it sucks over here. Guys are way more lonely. No one cares about us and the world is cold as fuck. \\n\\nI'm such a failure. Been working out 8 years and have gotten so weak and fat. I have a semester left of college and my grades may make it so I never go anywhere else idk. I'm tried. I just neede a place to vent I know the internet is bad but I just want to right it and send it to the abyss. Hell I'm probably going to blocked or some shit I hate that but it happens. This is loneliness and the internet age we have to post it. It only feels real when others see it we no longer feel real to ourselves.\", 'The diary of a recovering trauma victim    I guess like any good group i shall do the usual phrase, hello, i am anonymous and i am not mentally well. I knew I had issues from past therapist, friends and family trying to help, from OCD and anxiety as a child, to manic depression but I thought it was all temporary. Sure i had upset and downs along the way, who doesn\\'t? Family life hell? Completely normal. Abuse of all kinds at some point? Still normal. Unhealthy coping mechanisms? Also normal and the made me feel better.  After being told so many years no matter what I did that I was a freak who should be locked away, was to much for people or scaring people away who loved me..it got to me less and less to a point where I just accepted i was unlovable. I just choose to bury my self in work, still feeling thing? Just get another job for more work to fill the void. \\n   Now for the trigger for all this; 3 years ago I was living with my ex of 8 years, he had been by my side since I started trying trauma therapy for my mom and was still healing so he knew of my issues. He stayed by my side, said he had seen worse in combat when he was enlisted so I felt like he would take care of me, least that\\'s what I thought. It\\'s months before covid lockdown, I am working a meat processing plant making labels, the bread winner of us two and I felt proud as the management but it took a toll on me. I was doing on average 12 hr days 6 days a week for months and slowly it was eating at my sanity but I wanted too prove my worth, show how perfect I could be. Then after a bad email issue while exhausted I messed up a label order since I was losing track of things and was let go being told \"i was a liabily and not working hard enough\". I was mad but unusually calm, I said to myself \"I\\'ll just find a new job it\\'s fine\" all to keep me distracted from my life where against my wishes he had rejoined and got accepted. Because I loved him I figured it was worth the pain. Months pass, covid hits, I can\\'t find work and suddenly everything begins too get blurry as it was the beginning of what would be a 14 month mental break down. Suddenly that drive I had to work died, I manic painted sure but it\\'s like nothing else existed, I began too game more than usual, sleep in more, and of course talk too my ex boyfriend less. All this while trying too deal with the fact I had CPTSD from things involving my mother and I didn\\'t want too deal with them so I ghosted my therapist enevidably making it worse. I became a shell of a person, sleep, maybe eat, computer all day, repeat for months on end....I neve left the apartment, stopped going too my Sunday Market for facepainting, stopped talking too people, stopped interacting with my ex boyfriend much. I was no longer that workaholic he loved, but a hallow shell of a woman finally seeing how sad, depressed she was, and how badly she wished for death to finally stop feeling pain. He tried to \"talk\" but It was more of \"did you find a job yet?\" Rather than \"what\\'s wrong, how can I help?\". Then he got quiet on me, said military was making him go quiet to deal with shipping off away from me easier. I held best I could but I was angry, scared,broken, and didn\\'t understand why sides how much i hated he was leaving.\\n   Months go by, covid in full swing, I\\'m paying rent with state checks as I can\\'t work and we become more distant, we don\\'t have sex as often, he\\'s avoiding me, getting testy. Then he brings in a kitten..thinking it will help and instead after months of bear tragedy and scares I now have a inner hatred for a kitten, and my birthday as stuff happend that hit the nail on the coffin for me( I spend my last recent birthday crying and hating myself, wishing it could be all over and that I could die from ptsd from it) and now he\\'s more distant, I\\'m still a shell...trying to go too school again to help and oddly I find it something I\\'m good at despite my confidence lacking. But the first time it fails and I had to retake it as covid messed with stuff, the second time the last few weeks I\\'ll admit I just sat in a place of my old apartment staring at a wall till it was time to \"come home\" and faked it...I didn\\'t know why I was doing this, it wasnt.like me, I\\'m not like this...till.i realized I had dissociative disorder...specifically DID...I had been In a 14 month spell of no control and some amnesia, only recalling what I had done when it was all too late. That all ended with him sadly having an emotional affair and us ending things cause we were both too broken to really handle each others needs, especially when he saw how horrible mine were deep down. All this resulted in a other 6 months of pain, dissociation, but from my new roommates apartment. They took me in when I had to leave the old place but that\\'s a whole other story. I couldn\\'t work, was let go from jobs, cried till I fell asleep, couldn\\'t eat anything more than small chicken tenders...I was a wreck...then I found out that manic depression was basicly bipolar light, like my mother which made me nearly spiral. I had to learn it was alright but in my mind it was the last bit of hope I had too being cured, as it\\'s genetic. I was doomed in my eyes too being this beast no one would want. \\n    Leading too today....even as life\\'s gotten better it seems I have learned something big about myself on top of all this, all through my school years and some college I had a form a anorexia, started as feeling fat as a 5 ft 1, 110lb woman to If I do it enough I may starve myself since I was too chicken to use instruments. During work I began having a fantasy about how I wished someone would push me enough to get angry so I could get fired from my job so I had a reason too jump into traffic or take pain killers. Along with that same realization that I had been dissociating for almost a month and not eating as a form of punishment after many many years of being clean of it...it hurts so much too feel broken but I\\'m tired of this pain and want too finally take my life back. I vow too work on a regular weekly schedule of chores, working out, shower schedules,as well as water consumption as I also avoided it too harm myself. I will take my life back one day at a time...I will not let this disease take me and I refuse to be a statistic...figured I could journal on my reddit as i go and help anyone else who needs this as much as I do, it does get better, you can heal...it just takes time and also kicking n screaming as stubborn loved ones drag you and remind you too eat and do things...I guess if anyone wants to read along with me feel free otherwise, thank you for letting this poor soul clear her consciousness of guilt and shame she\\'s been holding onto.', 'Emotional Trauma Just recently my depression has been making more sense. After talking to a therapist and doing some research, I found out I suffer emotional trauma from childhood emotional neglect. \\n\\nGrowing up, my parents did a good job providing my sis and I with our basic needs. Food, shelter, and clothing. But not so much our mental needs. My mother is a narcissist and my father is her enabler and also kind of narc too. They had a very dysfunctional marriage. It got violent sometimes. But they often took out their anger at each other on my sister and me. \\n\\nThis explains a lot of why I live in such a painful existence. Through the childhood neglect, my mind learned that I didn’t matter. And so as I got older, my brain was rewired to think this by default about myself, and I lived life accordingly. This ended up with me developing trauma habits and side effects. People pleasing, not taking feedback well, inability to self love or accept love, insomnia, fatigue, irritability. \\n\\nThe people pleasing one is serious. They’ll be times where I’ll do something nice for someone, and I’m not sure why I did it. And then the person would look at me like I just did something weird. I subconsciously do this in hopes to get love in return. I was taught by my upbringing that love is conditional and I must perform in order to receive it. Which is why I developed that habit. \\n\\nI struggle with crippling loneliness. It often times keep me up crying at night. This is because I have self love issues. Because childhood neglect taught me that my feelings and needs weren’t important, my mind by default doesn’t see me as lovable. Which is why self care was also always a struggle for me too. I always feel guilty whenever I do something nice for myself. \\n\\nBut this just goes back to the inability to accept feedback. People always think it’s the negative feedback that’s the hardest to take, but for people like me who have emotional trauma, it’s actually the positive feedback that’s the hardest. Even though we don’t like negative feedback, it at least feels familiar to us due to the often negative feedback I received as a child. This made me develop a habit of self criticism and self sabotage. I’m an art student, and critiques from my classmates and professors are very common. But I did notice a weird common occurrence that happens during critiques. When it’s my turn to explain my work, I tend to be me very critical of my own work. So much that my professor sometimes has to stop me and reassure me. My classmates always gave me concerned looks after moments like this. I didn’t think much of it before I found out trauma makes me do that. \\n\\nI think the saddest habit though is the inability to accept positive feedback. I wasn’t self aware of it but I get nervous whenever someone shows interest in me or gives me a compliment. This is actually the part that makes it hard for me to accept love. Because love counts as positive feedback. Positive feedback gives me dysphoria that feels like guilt. Like I accidentally tricked someone into liking me, or into thinking that I’m capable. Or like they’ll find out how lame I really am and be disappointed. This affects my dating life. I’ve had to turn down a few people due to them showing interest in me. Whenever they show signs of liking me, I get very nervous and try distancing myself from them. My trauma only made me use to people who abuse me, not love me. This also makes me question my friends a lot. They’re always having to remind me that they enjoy me and want me in their lives, but it makes me feel bad whenever they say things like that. Because my trauma convinced me they would be better off without me. \\n\\nBut yeah that’s what I’ve been learning. I’m hoping this means I can heal now. Maybe this would help some of you guys. \\n\\nI’m just tired of my existence being agony.', 'My family gave me trauma and increased my depression So recently my cousin got into a very prestigious college and I’m going to a local one. However, everyone in my family is congratulating her and wishing her the best, but I can already tell that they knew she was gonna succeed either way and they knew that I wasn’t gonna become anything. \\n\\nThis will now follow me my entire life and I can’t help but feel even more… pathetic about who I am. \\n\\nCan you believe that your worth is really depended on which school you go too? \\n\\nHere’s the funnier thing… my parents don’t even think I can pass college. They say I’m dumb and I don’t study enough and that’s why I couldn’t get into any better school. \\n\\nHonestly, I can try to tell myself that its\\nnot a big deal. BUT I’m being constantly reminded every single damn day I’m not smart like her. \\n\\nIt’s whatever…. Just wanted to rant.', '33M I feel like my life lacks meaning and is without happiness.. trauma, unrealized mental health concerns and and overbearing sense of failure Edit: I told my mom tonight that things haven\\'t been going so great at work, and that I really feel like I just don\\'t have the mind for the type of job that it is.. that I have a lot of brain fog, and she knows I don\\'t have a good memory. I don\\'t plan on quitting, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they ended up getting rid of me eventually, and that that thought makes me very anxious and depressed. She seemed mad, and responded with \"  I don\\'t know what to tell ya. If you lose this job your fucked. Guess you\\'ll just work at Cumby\\'s or Walmart then..unbelievable.\" We went to a family party recently..all my cousins are doing really well for themselves. Two of them make 6 figures -- one of which just bought his own house to the tune of 400k. Another is a musical prodigy -- he\\'s been playing guitar semi-profession since he was 8-9, and works for a big company that sells  sound systems to major venues/stadiums. He\\'s getting married and having a baby soon. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI can tell that my mom thinks of me as a failure and a disappointment. Guess that makes two of us..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t really know where to even begin..I\\'m just writing to vent because that\\'s all I feel I can do. My life feels like a pit, void of any happiness. I have no friends. No lover. No kids. I hate my job. I feel like I wasted my time going to college for something that wasn\\'t medical, IT or engineering. I have little to no talent. I have no skills nor hobbies aside from videogames -- which I now find more depressing than fun..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI feel like my depression has gotten worse the last year or so, and I don\\'t know how much longer I can stand to bear it. I\\'m really just not happy with a single aspect of my life..and I fear that I\\'m not able to fix my situation. I\\'m 33M, and for the past..4-5 years now, I\\'ve been living with my mother in her small mobile home. My room is little more than 10x10 ft -- just enough room for a single mattress, a small nightstand and my tv. I don\\'t have any closet space, so I hang my clothes on the shower and just remove them when I need to use it. Due to lack of space, it also doesn\\'t feel like I\\'m able to express myself..the little room I have is used for necessity, not as a showcase for who I am -- though, if I\\'m being honest..I don\\'t really feel like I know that person anyway -shrug.-\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMe and my mother have a bit of a strained relationship..We are very different people, don\\'t share similar beliefs when it comes to a lot of different subjects, and while we love eachother, we really don\\'t \"like\" one another.. she comes off as \"over positive\" at times while I\\'m just miserable.. which wears on both of us. She started seeing an abusive drunk when I was around 9. He would beat her, call her awful names..when I was 10-11 or so, he once had a conversation with me about how much of a whore she was and that I was whore trash. My grandparents got DCF involved at one point and he wasn\\'t suppose to be coming around, but my mom would let him anyway and then tell me to lie to DCF or else they\\'d take me away -- great parenting, I know. He eventually went to jail and stopped drinking for a bit..but even off of alcohol, he was a mean bastard, very jealous and controlling. I suffered years of emotional and psychological abuse as a result.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFor years, I always felt like I was walking on eggshells whenever I was home. From a very early age, I would detach and shelter myself from others, staying in my room with the door closed for hours, occasionally listening to him yelling at her or about me. Because of this, I was also very hesitant to ever bring people in to my life. I had friends and girlfriends, but I hardly ever let them come over -- we would need to hang out at their houses or go elsewhere. One time I had a friend sleep over, just for this piece of shit to start trouble in the middle of the night. Cops were called, and my friend (( who came from a perfectly loving home,)) pretty much stopped talking to me afterwards because they had been scared shitless. Part of me will never forgive her for that..She had plenty of opportunities to get rid of him, and yet always went back to him time and time again. I would think that the ordeal was finally over, just for her to eventually bring him back. Even to this day, despite having gotten divorced they remain \"friends.\" She occasionally buys him groceries or runs him cigarettes and beer. Myself and my grandparents fully suspect they have a secret relationship..I truly do feel that I am the way I am today because of how damaging his presence in my life was. While I am not diagnosed, I fully suspect that I have PTSD, anxiety, social anxiety and mood swings. I also have thought for some time that I may be high functioning autistic or possibly have ADHD.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy father was never really present in my life..he was a drug dealer. When I was a baby, he would take me to the mall with him and sell coke out of the stroller / diaper bag. He ended up going to jail. When he got out, he would visit here and there..he always showed up with an expensive gift for my birthday or xmas. Even as a kid, I knew that these were means by which he was trying to \"buy my love,\" because he couldn\\'t be bothered to gain it by actually being involved. I took it upon myself to start visiting him once a week in my early 20s to try to build a relationship. As a test, I stopped going after so many visits, just to see if he would put in the effort to see where I was. To this day he has never bothered to reach out. He never taught me anything, or mentored me, or introduced me to his passions. I was hardly an afterthought.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI hate my father.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs I\\'ve gotten older, my friend circle has dwindled to the point of being nonexistent. I use to rent with two of my oldest friends, one of which was my best friend growing up. Our mutual interests have grown far and few, and on more than one occasion it became pretty evident that they didn\\'t really see me as much of a friend anymore. I\\'ll never forget the time that they, along with some other friends, went to go see Joker and didn\\'t bother to invite me. I didn\\'t make a big deal out of it, but when they came home later that night and told me they went to go see it, I responded with something like \" Damn man, wish I had gotten an invite! I\\'ve been wanting to see it,\" to which my best friend responded, \" I thought I invited you but I guess not. Sorry, you\\'re just forgettable.\" Nowadays we\\'re more old friends than best friends -- if you can even call us that. We occasionally play games together once and awhile, but the truth is that we really just aren\\'t close anymore, and I think we\\'re both well aware of that.After high school, I ended up meeting a girl who introduced me to the party scene, and a whole new social circle. I dropped out of college because I didn\\'t really know what I wanted to do with my life -- and I still don\\'t. I partied for a few years, started getting in to trouble more often and eventually decided that I needed to fix myself -- so I joined the military. The military pulled me out of the party lifestyle long enough that I never went back, but it also put a strain on a lot of friendships and definitely ruined some relationships..leading to a smaller social circle. I eventually went back to college for communications. At the time, I had hoped to get in to marketing or sales, but I live in a small, dying county in the poor end of Massachusetts, and those types of jobs really just don\\'t exist around here.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI ended up working for a local newspaper for awhile making minimum wage as a night time copy editor. one thing led to another, and I now work for a courthouse making considerably more money -- but I hate the work. I deal with mostly angry people..people who are upset that they can\\'t see their kids, or mad that their child support is so high. There is a lot to learn, and given all my past trauma, I find that I have a lot of brain fog and have a very, very hard time remembered the procedures for everything that I\\'m expected to help with. I did not go to school for law and have virtually 0 interest in it. I don\\'t even like watching court TV. My forgetfulness and need to ask questions has begun wearing on my co-workers, to the point that I fear that someone(s) will eventually speak to management about my poor performance. The anxiety this all produces has led me to have an outburst of frustration at work on more than one occasion. I can tell my boss doesn\\'t like me, and my co-workers feel I am incompetent. At 33, if I were to lose this job, I really don\\'t know what I would even do to earn a comparable salary. Me moving out and having at least some semblance of a normal human life rests on me having this job.My talents are few, and I don\\'t have any hobbies outside of playing videogames.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI use to enjoy making artwork in photoshop, creative writing and photography, but over the years those things have fallen to the way side -- Photoshop is expensive and cracked versions aren\\'t as easy to come by, I feel that I\\'ve literally lost my ability to write creatively, and taking photos just feels awkward and weird when I have no one to tag along.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo..at 33, I have virtually no friends nor the means to meet new people. I have social anxiety and don\\'t have hobbies nor a social circle to help me meet others. I live in a small room, in a trailer, with my mother -- which means that dating has been off the table for awhile. I am ridden with mental problems, am in danger of losing a job that I hate -- but feel the need to keep because it pays better than any other job I\\'ve had, and have nothing to fall back on should that ever happen. I owe about 13k in student loans, with only about 20k in the bank.. I had planned on saving up to 30k before starting to look for a mobile home of my own (( it beats renting..)) but loan forgiveness falling through has put me right back where I started nearly 2 years ago.', 'My story (religious trauma) Story \\n\\n\\nMy story (first post ever)\\n\\nHello, to someone who might read this. \\n\\nIt feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. \\nI\\'m not professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don\\'t tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it\\'s not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the \"phase\" I have. \\n\\nBut I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I\\'m going to. \\nAs long as that is impossible I\\'m trying to figure out what is going on with me on my own. \\n\\nI did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.\\n\\n I thought my issues weren\\'t that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can\\'t call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. \\n\\nGenerally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it\\'s gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. \\n\\nAnd now there are two parts of me fighting. \\nThe one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I\\'m exaggerating, that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. \\n\\nIm torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. \\nI feel like no one could ever get me. \\nBecause my \"trauma\" doesn\\'t feel validated. \\nEven though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. \\n\\nIt still feels like I don\\'t deserve to be heard. \\nBecause on the surface everything was perfectly fine. \\n\\nAnd even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can\\'t. I can\\'t look at the positive aspects and live normally. \\n\\nIt affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can\\'t concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I\\'m constantly on guard and don\\'t feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I\\'m hiding fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I\\'m at my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I\\'m not worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I\\'m not obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don\\'t want them to think that what she does is real love. \\n\\nBut the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a \"myself\" even exist? Can I ever be \"it\"? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. \\n\\nI feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. \\n\\nEverything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. \\nThat\\'s why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can\\'t get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). \\n\\nI feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. \\n\\nIm doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can\\'t do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. \\n\\nThat was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. \\n\\nSo, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?\\n\\n (I\\'ll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I\\'m missing blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) \\n\\nIt all started even before I was born. \\nMy parents found each other through friends and got together. \\n\\nMy mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don\\'t exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle\\'s parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.\\nThey got together and married. \\n\\nThen their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. \\n\\nThen I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. \\nI never knew anything different. \\n\\nAnd as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the \"big\" service. \\n\\nAnd then the indoctrination started. \\n\\nI don\\'t remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? \\n\\nI just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren\\'t much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. \\nNow it\\'s easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. \\nBut at what price? \\n\\nIt\\'s scary to me that my memories are so blurry. \\nI don\\'t even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).\\n\\nI just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god\\'s eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. \\nI wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. \\nAnd I achieved that, I think. \\n\\nBut now I hate my past self for caring so much.\\n \\nSo what where we taught there? \\nGod created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil\\'s work) and even though they didn\\'t say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the \"real\" truth and that every other church doesn\\'t have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. \\n\\nWe were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god\\'s (the church\\'s) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.\\n\\n So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don\\'t have control about anything anyways. \\n\\nBut we\\'re still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a \"free will\" granted from god. \\n\\nWhile writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. \\nAnd it was a core beliefe of mine. \\n\\nWhen an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can\\'t anymore. \\nAnd then everything shatters. \\n\\nLosing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. \\n\\nSo in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you\\'re not saved (because for someone who is \"really\" saved it\\'s physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it\\'s because god did it. \\n\\nYou\\'re never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You\\'re even unable to think in the \"right, good way\". So you\\'re basically nothing and unimportant. \\n\\nBut when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you\\'re worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. \\n\\nAnother bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you\\'re nothing but with god you\\'re worthy. \\nIt makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. \\n\\nWho are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. \\n\\nThat\\'s why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying \"sh*t\" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. \\n\\nBecause of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the \"world\" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). \\n\\nWe weren\\'t allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren\\'t allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. \\n\\nSo if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you \"fall in love\" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren\\'t sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. \\n\\nWe were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner\\'s personality. \\nThey told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.\\n\\nAnother contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think \"wow I really value my partner as a person\". \\nNo, they\\'re s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). \\n\\nNo one is appreciating anything. \\nAnd if they are, they\\'re VERY lucky. \\n\\nBecause there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. \\n\\nGirls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. \\nAnd if you\\'re all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn\\'t want you, wouldn\\'t he? \\n\\nWe were told we were pure glasses of water. \\nAnd if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. \\n\\nBut the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That\\'s why there should be only one guy from the start. \\n\\nSo that you don\\'t end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. \\nNow I know it\\'s bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. \\n\\nWe were told to cover up so guys don\\'t sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren\\'t tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. \\n\\nAnd if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you\\'d get in trouble for it.\\n\\nI was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I\\'m glad mine wasn\\'t as controlling as others and didn\\'t force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. \\n\\nI was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that\\'s the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn\\'t really enjoy). \\n\\nSo there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. \\n\\nWith 12 you move from being with children to the \"big\" service and you\\'re finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. \\n\\nBut then you\\'re also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. \\n\\nWhen I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to \"work\".)\\n\\nBecause in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I\\'d be called that it would curse me. \\n\\nI did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be \"myself\", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn\\'t do that, because no one can ). \\n\\nI thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was \"myself\" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. \\n\\nAnd I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn\\'t notice at the time. \\n\\nPeople abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you\\'re not inviting people. \\n\\nI\\'m so glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. \\nWhich I was for being in that \"church\". \\nAnd they told me early on: it\\'s a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. \\nBut we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. \\n\\nSchool was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. \\nAnd even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn\\'t feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren\\'t allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why my definition of \"home\" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. \\n\\nSo what was living in my \"home\" like? \\n\\nI\\'m the first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I\\'m told is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.\\n\\nWhen I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. \\n\\nSo I just learned to not show my emotions at all at \"home\". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. \\n\\nMy father was in control of everything and to this day he\\'s still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. \\nAnd he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. \\n\\nHe is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. \\n\\nMy parents (more my father) still don\\'t want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can\\'t ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. \\n\\nAs I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn\\'t have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that\\'s what god made us for. \\n\\nPopping out babies, cleaning und cooking. \\n\\nBut I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. \\n\\nAnd then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? \\n\\nIn church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. \\n\\nBecause your husband is by god\\'s law above you and there to \"lead\" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can\\'t decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don\\'t have control anyways. \\n\\nThat\\'s why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what\\'s going on.\\n\\nI idolized my father until the realization that we don\\'t have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. \\n\\nI had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn\\'t find anything. \\n\\nHe wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. \\nIn front of him I am what he wants me to be. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I\\'m honestly sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. \\n\\nI could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. \\n\\nWhenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I\\'m highly dependent. \\n\\nAnother thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife\\'s home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). \\n\\nWhen I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. \\n\\nAnd in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.\\n\\nI know that I was sad but I somehow can\\'t really recall my immediate emotions from that day. \\n\\nAnd I thought I\\'m glad that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn\\'t able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn\\'t cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn\\'t think about it for years. \\n\\nBut when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. \\n\\nIt was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn\\'t I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn\\'t process properly. \\n\\nThen three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. \\n\\nWhen I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). \\n\\nBack to the cult. \\nSo am I still there? No. \\n\\nMy parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September 2018 we drove away and never came back. \\n\\nAnd many others left too. \\nWe still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don\\'t want to confront my parents.\\n \\nI really don\\'t want to be there because every time we\\'re there I\\'m not really there. I\\'m just a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I\\'m always completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can\\'t control it. \\n\\nAnd sometimes I\\'m just sad for no reason, I still can\\'t sleep and still get a massive headache and can\\'t stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn\\'t and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can\\'t stop. \\n\\nAnd it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn\\'t understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am really grateful for. \\n\\nAnd something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. \\n\\nNow I can control if I\\'m going to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.\\n\\nWhen my father is mad at me because I didn\\'t do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it\\'s disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn\\'t stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It\\'s the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. \\n\\nThere are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am and then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I\\'m the best daughter someone could have and that he\\'s so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. \\n\\nBut on the inside I think: \"if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don\\'t of, you wouldn\\'t talk to me anymore\". \\n\\nHe is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. \\n\\nAnd also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: \"I\\'m sorry but it\\'s too late.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. \\n\\nThe first 16 years of my life partly wasted. \\nI feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. \\nAnd I know it\\'s technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. \\n\\nAnd it makes me so mad that I was born because of the \"church\". Because they convinced my father to have children. \\nI was cursed before I even existed. \\n\\nAnd still. \\n\\nI can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. \\n\\nAll of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. \\n\\nThere is no moment in my life where I wasn\\'t afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.\\n\\nAnd it was so frightening, because when it\\'s out that you messed up you can\\'t attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that\\'s when people know. They see that you\\'re not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course \"premarital s*x!!!\" \\n\\nWhen a couple did it (and someone found out) it\\'s made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. \\n\\nAnd I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.\\n\\n I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.\\n\\n My parents and everyone in church who was \"responsible\" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a \"bad influence\" away from me. \\n\\nBut I still watched what I wasn\\'t allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. \\n\\nBasic knowledge like: it\\'s okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.\\n \\nAnd now? I just want to move out and study something so I\\'m always safe. I can\\'t wait for the day where I\\'m finally going to be financially independent and don\\'t have to rely on my father.\\n\\nWow it feels good put all of that in words. \\n\\nWhen you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. \\n\\nI just wish I could get help.\\n\\n\\n\\nupdate: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn\\'t wait any longer (I was stubborn). \\nSo now i\\'m going to therapy. \\nThank you for everyone who commented.

I felt like I was struck by lightening and I\\'m still trying to process everything I have just realized for the first time. \\n\\nA small background - I was sure I had PTSD. During my early to late teenage years I was sexually abused by my step-brother, raped by two work colleagues (I worked in healthcare- more reason I don\\'t trust healthcare workers). I attempted suicide at 17 years old. My mothers response : \"I hate my life too, I might go kill myself.\" \\n\\nI am always trying and finding ways to forget, I hate remembering, I hate flashbacks - I just tell myself to shut up, stick my earphones in attempting to drown out my head. I have never slept well, I\\'m used to getting little to no sleep. \\n\\nHere lies the problem and why I feel how I am was normal: My narcissistic mother.  Of course the history of SA has had an awful impact on my life, soul crushing, something I have tried to address in the past but felt nothing worked. I tried to keep going, I didn\\'t want to kill myself anymore (had thoughts but no plans) because of the guilt and fear my mother put on me. I just don\\'t want to exist. But I didn\\'t realize my mum was the root of my constant low mood and no self esteem. \\n\\nI got to this point in my life: \\n\\n\\\\- I left my job that I wanted to do, I wanted to be a nurse but and just couldn\\'t take it anymore. \\n\\n\\\\- Went back to college, did well - got into university and gave it my all, I\\'ve never worked so hard in an academic setting, did the best I\\'ve ever done. \\n\\n\\\\- Moved into a place with my beloved partner of 4 years. \\n\\nAnd then it all hit at once \"Why do I still feel like this?\" I\\'ve worked hard, I felt like I had done everything I could to lessen the pain. It didn\\'t matter, I don\\'t know who am and feel immense shame and guilt. I thought working hard and progress would give myself confidence, but it didn\\'t. I have never fully looked at myself or tried to understand myself. It was too painful. I wanted to persevere my way to happiness, no matter how miserable I felt during the process. In my mind - I don\\'t matter, others do. If I can make other people happy or help, that\\'s enough for me to be aloud to exist here.   \\n\\nI walked on eggshells my whole childhood. My mum emotionally and physically abused me. I remember feeling like I didn\\'t know what I had done wrong and confused after my mum would scream, cry and throw a desk at me from across the room then leave me alone and not talk to me for days. She would constantly spin everything to be about her and still does but it helps I\\'m no longer a child and \"that\\'s just what mum is like.\"  One thing that really got to me when I was telling the Dr all the things my mum did to me as a child I stopped and said \"Don\\'t get me wrong, it wasn\\'t all bad\" and straight away she informed me: \"Children are incredibly resilient and will find happiness in all types of situations.\" I felt sad hearing that.    \\n\\nMy grandma is my mum, in my mind. She took care of me and gave me a happy and safe environment. I am so thankful and lucky to have her in my life, if it wasn\\'t for her I wouldn\\'t be able to go on. She doesn\\'t hug me like my mum does or say \"I love you\" like my mum does. That doesn\\'t matter, I can just feel the real love she gives. \\n\\nStrangely enough, I care for my mother a lot and feel sorry for her, I have more of a sibling relationship with my mum and I learnt how keep her happy by this age to make my life easier (when my childhood dog died she was hellish to be around, I saved money and used savings to get her a puppy for Christmas, she had also suffered a miscarriage and I just wanted to make her feel happy again) . I do love her, I just don\\'t think she was/is a good mum (single mother and only child) and has issues that have never been addressed.

To anyone reading, if you have similar experiences and have had depression all your life without realizing - \\n\\nGo and get help if you can. It\\'s been an excruciating to get to this point validation and I wish I went sooner. Much sooner. My family and especially my grandmother are against medication and have that attitude to life of \"You just have to keep going\" and \"Laugh and the world with laugh with you, cry and you will cry alone.\" Which is why I did just carry on until I broke. \\n\\nDon\\'t cry alone.', \"I love my parents despite the traumas they cause me I love my parents, and they love me too. They aren't perfect, but they try their best to satisfy me with gifts, especially my father. Even when he doesn't really have money, he tries to give me Jordan's. They're very defensive when people try to attack me even if it’s their siblings joking with me and so on.\\n\\nHowever, I can't get over the trauma of physical and mental abuse I got from them, even though I kind of deserved it. The beatings and the constant name-calling In my family and country, mental health isn't really addressed and even though my parents, especially my father, are very well educated, they still have a very hard time accepting it's a thing. They bullied me, thinking it would make me do something better. For example, calling me fat so I lose weight. Even if I try to do something like lose weight, they always try to intervene and tell me how to do it, which really annoys me and makes me change my mind. In 2020, I proved that if I wanted to lose weight, I could and lost 10 kgs in 2 weeks by legit starving myself and yet they still called me an elephant. But what really annoys me is the fact that I always told them I wanted to speak with a therapist, even since I was 12. Even lately, I've tried to convince them to go to family therapy. They also kept throwing their responsibilities and errands on me since I still hadn't entered university and didn't have a license and I kept mentioning that I hated it. I'm legit a parent to my siblings because they're too lazy to parent when they come back from work. I mean, I get that their jobs are stressful and I don't mind helping, but I don't want to take their jobs as a parent. I really wish I could just get my scholarship accepted so I could leave for 5 years and take a break from this weirdly loving yet dramatic and kind of toxic family.\", \"Depressive Episodes+Mental Trauma (Disclaimer: I'm not suicidal in any way (Yet). There is no need to report this to any emergency service.)\\n\\nI'll give the rundown of what caused this practical relapse into depression (Not diagnosed yet, but at this point, I feel as if it's a relapse). I walked in on my great-grandmother's corpse on Jan 25 of this year. I was the one to make that 911 call. That day was hell on earth. (Mental Trauma aspect)\\n\\nNow, You'd think counseling, working out, cooking, cleaning, listening to music, talking about it with others, going outside, and fighting it off would work now? It never worked. I tried everything for nearly 3 months until April when I finally just gave up on trying to fight off a relapse. Trying to fight it off was too mentally taxing on me (Ultimately fighting it made it worse when it hit).\\n\\nEver since April, I've just been having these episodes that last hours. First comes in the sadness, then the emptiness, then the anger, and pure contempt. This mentally and physically to a point exhausts me.  It's been making me miss classes, and I don't know if I can go to In and do in-school state testing (Forced into physically going by the ISD, and Higher-ups) Even now I just feel sad, and mentally just empty. I maybe have a psychiatrist coming in to study what the fuck is going on with me and to diagnose me. I don't know how long that will take.\\n\\nI've done everything in MY power, I stress that to a very high degree. I've practically done most things you can think of, and it has done fuck all. I just don't know what else to do.\", \"I'm suffering from Religious Trauma Syndrome. I feel trapped. I'm agnostic/atheist or something other than the evangelical christianity I was indoctrinated into growing up.\\n\\nI did not ever have a choice in 'believing' or 'having faith' that was something drilled into me from early childhood. I was a 'good christian' and what's funniest about all this was how early on I had already realized how much of a bunch of crockery it all was but I still tried to make it all work for everyone else, because while I didn't really buy into it all, I honestly thought I should try and help this community of people I was born and raised into. Like, they're people, they're humans like me, I just want everyone to be happy? What could be wrong with that?\\n\\nCue decades later. Turns out it caused immense amounts of psychological trauma due to all the things I forced myself to do for the 'good of everyone' and then was later guilted into believing it was because I wanted to do these things for everyone so of course I couldn't even confront the people who forced me to do these things.\\n\\nMentally I have been traumatized. I'm just finally coming to terms with the full extent of the damage.\\n\\nI think thankfully I've been able to get out of the helplessness phase of things but now I'm just trying to get back so many pieces of my brain that feel locked away from me. It feels like other people have trapped me from having full access to life and it's like I can't live out of fear of some giant rock in the sky that is going to smite me for finally living and being happy.\\n\\nIt's all so much BS. I just wish I could get my brain firing again the right way. I wish I didn't have all these years of trauma built up and self harm caused by being part of a religion I didn't want to be part of but felt guilted by association... Even now I'm not entirely free, I'm still closeted in my lack of faith and frankly I'd feel unsafe if I ever did let anyone know. These people are insane.  \\n\\n\\nI need help....

I had close friends growing up, I was the outsider in a group. \\n\\nIn high school, I was misunderstood for being aware of my sexuality at a young age. Nobody really guided me, but I was shamed and called names even by adults when what I needed at the time was proper knowledge with the changes happening to me and my body.\\n\\nI was sexually abused when I was in high school by my boyfriend at the time.

Context is I have academic trauma, I am atleast a top notcher. While I was in Nursery until Graduation of grade school I am literally your generic anime boy who has good grades and gets to join competitions on maths, etc. Some P.E competitions and being one of the top performers in swimming etc. Now in highschool I have gone shit soooooooooo bad. Imagine the most glorious bridge in history suddenly collapsing. Now whenever my mom says\" How is your grades\", \"Have you contacted your teachers about your grades\" I get intense panic and anxiety that I cant even think straight its so bad tha it once pushed me to the you know option for depressed persons when I was 12 ( Yes I was so young but I cant handle my sanity that time) It failed. Now again fast forward I am going to a university now and the University has grade requirements and I dont even think I am eligible and plus my grades is crap since pandemic class. Idk what to do, I feel like if they will know, Im in a very serious matter and will probably resolve to ending it again.

Context: My senior year of high school (2017- 2018)downloaded a ton of social apps to help with me feeling lonely, over the course of an entire year a ton of events took place that basically ended with me being alone. (Bullying/harassment) It stuck inside of me hard and after only a few weeks or months all my motivation to do anything was completely gone. I remember taking the PSAT online and just looking at the screen my stomach hurting so bad and I just had to stop. \\n\\nI realize it was all online and I could just leave but I’m extremely insecure and vulnerable the entire reason i got the app was to make real friends. Every few months something would happen where I was abused or tell me my depression wasn’t warranted or I didn’t matter after awhile I felt that no one wanted me so well went out of my way to be the person my bully’s told me I was and ended up ruining actually good relationships. This combined with my already present depression and social anxiety to make me do a ton of stupid shit that I can never take back. Like link my address multiple times and tell people to murder me. \\n\\nStarting 2019 I got the sort of persona of I’m beyond all of that and got a superiority type of personality. I drowned myself in basically anything and convinced myself that I had moved on telling myself it took place a year go. I tried to kill myself multiple times but failed so decided to stop being suicidal and focus on remembering my past life. \\n\\nJump until now its 2021 and idk when specifically it came back but after ignoring it for serval years all of a sudden over the course of a week I got confused as I cannot believe it’s already 2021 my mind is stuck in 2018. I felt lonely and started thinking about and trying to get into contact with my older friends. \\n\\nI got one to message me and apologized but for obvious reasons it’s not the same. Other one who blocked me I tried to add back on a alt but they denied me, which is hard because she’s the one I hurt the most and abused the most in all of this. I just wanted to apologize . The rest haven’t responded yet but it feels like my mind has been taken back to 2018 I keep getting the feelings of those days the anxiety the stress I couldn’t even fucking sleep this morning stressed out. I kept thinking while diving slowly into sleep of returning back to 2017. \\n\\nNow thats alI I can think about.  And it’s not even to change ANYTHING. It’s purely to reexperience all of the hurt and pain idk why. There’s nothing I want to change I just want to be trapped in the cycle of 2017-2018. It’s gotten to the point where happy memories of my childhood get blocked out by the trauma and I feel they don’t matter only that pain matters what does this mean how do I get past this????

However, much of what is purported to be factual is actually twisted by inherent racism. For example, the assertion that black people commit more violent crime than white people is false: In fact, black people are arrested/convicted for violent crime more often than white people. The statistic does not represent a fact-based commentary on a racial proclivity; it represents a way in which systemic racism has unfairly maligned a historically marginalized portion of the population.\\n\\nFurthermore, even objective facts can be presented in a manner that promotes (or is promoted by) a racist agenda. It may be factual to state that a given entertainer is Jewish, for instance, but if that point is being raised as a means of insinuating something anti-Semitic, it is nonetheless an example of bigotry. Statements of this sort are referred to as \"dog-whistles;\" as coded phrases that are ostensibly based in fact, but which are being presented with bad-faith intentions.\\n\\nDog-whistles, implied bigotry, and memetic phrases with bigoted subtexts are all forbidden in /r/ThereWasAnAttempt.

He was transferred to the prison he was to serve time at and was only in gen pop for an hour before his throat was slit by a fellow inmate.', nan, nan, 'The DSMP community absolutely desecrating the progress and stigma reduction for DID/OSDD 🥴 For the last few years more and more of these DSMP alters/systems have been popping up and making a mockery of DID/OSDD. There can never just be one and they do these source/canon calls like people do with kin. It\\'s a game to them\\n\\nI\\'m not doubting that these kids have been through things. And there\\'s always a chance of being wrong which is healthy to acknowledge. Growing up in a pandemic, so many political issues, plus whatever personal trauma may cause these behaviors. But it does take repeated, SEVERE early childhood trauma to develop DID/OSDD to an extent most will never experience, even some badly abused kids. A DSMP introject isn\\'t impossible per se but it\\'s not very likely or something that makes sense to happen at this frequency or even close to it. A child likely wouldn\\'t need to develop the whole DSMP cast to survive\\n\\nThe positivity post is wholesome but it does take so much to develop dissociative disorders. Though pwDID do undermine their own trauma oftentimes, a post like that won\\'t likely apply to them unless their trauma came from elsewhere (not parents/family)\\n\\nBut for such a horrendous disorder they treat these alleged introjects like novelties, all acting in character. It\\'s all like one big party trick and not much different from kin to them. This is extremely rare with other fandoms, maybe sometimes BNHA and Homestuck get treated similarly but DSMP is on another level. And if you ever met an introject of any of these sources, they probably wouldn\\'t tell you\\n\\nAnd \"comfort/hyperfixation/ASD\" is not a reason for a bunch of characters to appear with their wacky hijinks and funny banter. Most introjects are of real people, abusers. They can take on persecutory roles, reenacting some of the worst trauma of your life- as opposed to reenacting your favorite Owl House scenes\\n\\nAlters may do horrible things to their bodies and think they are evil, they may sabotage recovery, they may be SEVERELY brainwashed to always return to their abuser(s). They can destroy friendships, relationships, education, and life opportunities. Over 70% of pwDID actively attempt suicide at some point. There are many comorbidities both physical and mental so these people often suffer from many other things they\\'re often not self dxing but have no choice other than to get help/dxed due to how debilitating symptoms are\\n\\nI want the people doing things like this to know all this because I truly mean them no harm but this is dangerous and harms so many people. People who think they\\'re freaks and monsters and crazy as they watch these 15 year olds proudly and openly claim to have dozens of DSMP alters. Read the DSM-V section for DID titled \"Factitious disorder and malingering\" because the consistencies are uncanny', 'Just wanted to share that sometimes seeing a professional can actually create illness fakers, not cure them I just wanted to offer a potential alternate perspective for why some of these people may be misdiagnosing themselves, especially the ones who insist that they were already \"officially diagnosed\" even when their diagnoses clearly make no sense.  Sometimes patients can be misguided by a very unprofessional therapist, and unfortunately, that\\'s what happened to me. I had a therapist who tried to pin every label she could on me without actually going through the diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists can be much the same way, they have such a limited amount of time that they\\'ve become complacent with just assuming you have some garden variety problem without even glancing at your chart and then slap you with whatever prescription they\\'re being told to shill out for the time or wtfever. \\n\\nI\\'d been hit with OCD, OSDD/DID, ADHD, Bipolar II, dependent personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder (which can\\'t even be diagnosed in minors??), avoidant personality disorder, \\'almost schizophrenic yet obviously sane\\' (wtf does that mean???),  gender identity disorder (boy did that one royally fuck me up for a while!), etc etc. At one point my therapist got frustrated and said \"Ugh I just can\\'t figure you out!\" and sent me for a 3 day barrage of testing by a psychologist who clearly had some kind of agenda and convinced me I obviously had gender identity disorder and nothing else. Later a psychiatrist would declare that I also have OCD and ADHD and medicated me for both, and both of the meds just made me feel worse. I was so lost and desperate to understand myself and get my issues treated so I could just have a normal life, that I was compliant and really managed to convince myself (with their pressure, and my parent\\'s pressure since it took the heat off of them) that it was all true. I believed I was the opposite gender and had OCD and ADHD for YEARS until it lead me to an actual nervous breakdown because I was unknowingly living a complete lie. TikTok didn\\'t exist, but I did have a tumblr account where coincidentally I was surrounded by like-minded people who reinforced this in me for a while, and I proudly allowed these labels to become my identity. This isn\\'t a knock against anyone who is transgender btw, just my personal experience with bad doctors. But imagine if I had really gone through with taking hormones and permanently altering my body, which I nearly did... I would have likely ended up suicidal. \\n\\nDeep down I knew something wasn\\'t right, and it turned out, after all that wasted time, I just had really shitty doctors and once I finally changed to a new office that wasn\\'t completely irresponsible, my new therapist and I were able to figure out (over the course of YEARS of slowly sharing my whole life story and deconstructing all my defense mechanisms with her) that I actually had none of those disorders, and am in fact just on the autism spectrum with some PTSD-like symptoms due to childhood neglect and emotional abuse, as well as substance abuse issues due to some of the meds I\\'d been misprescribed. This made SO MUCH MORE SENSE and has vastly improved my mental health and the treatment I\\'m receiving, and I\\'m doing better than ever. My previous therapist never even discussed what was going on at home with me, and I was a minor at the time!\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m just offering a perspective on how sometimes, seeing a professional can actually CREATE illness fakers, not cure them... I wonder how many of the people featured here are in a similar situation? Sorry for rambling, I haven\\'t even had my coffee yet...', nan, 'Roommate apparently have 100+ alters I don’t really know what to think of this, I would like to know y’all´s opinion on the subject. But basically, I recently got put in a mental hospital where I share some kind of small campus with other old teenage/young adult. There’s this one person who claim to be a system with like 100+ alters, many of them are fictives. most Of the alters’s sources are anime or genshin impact. And they are 19. Considering that did is a very complex disorder, based off trauma and that most of people with did are diagnosed in their advanced adulthood, I struggle a bit to fully believe them.   \\nwhat do you guys think?   \\n(please keep in mind that, like many of us in the unity, they’re probably in a hospital for a reason. So they probably don’t do well in life in general. I think many of kids who haves depression or anxiety wants to have more \"fancy\" disorder to feel special? Idk) \\n\\nalso sorry if this post is not in the best English, it’s not my first language', 'faking illness isn\\'t always a sign of mental illness in itself This whole \"a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they\\'re faking\" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they\\'re doing and still want to feel validated for it. \\nLet me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who\\'s probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. \\nOf course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. \\n\\nSee, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. \\nBut while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. \\n\\nIt first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don\\'t need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it\\'s easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing \"depressed\" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today\\'s teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren\\'t. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. \\n\\nThen we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I\\'m not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that\\'s as far as my memory goes and I\\'d appreciate elaboration. \\n\\nNow, it\\'s important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it\\'s not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I\\'m sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as \"damaged\". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. \\n\\nToday, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It\\'s actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you\\'re born with it, it\\'s not developed from trauma... \\nBut anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn\\'t identify as that) you talk to chances are she\\'s gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it\\'s actually so wide spread that it\\'s unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I\\'ve tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It\\'s incredibly depressing, and it\\'s a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word \\'depressing\\' just now, it\\'s no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you\\'d be looked down on it for because you don\\'t have a mental illness that implies that you\\'ve went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don\\'t even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that\\'s developed from lots of trauma and it\\'s kind of just assumed that you\\'re living a \"hellish life\".\\n\\nNow back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they\\'re in. It\\'s just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. \\nYou\\'re not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that\\'s causing you to be an attention seeker. You\\'re faking because it\\'s simply what everyone around you is doing, it\\'s what\\'s deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it\\'s what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. \\nThat does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren\\'t the reason they\\'re faking. \\nAnd that\\'s honestly not even those teens\\' faults. I\\'m sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it\\'s important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. \\n\\nThese people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you\\'ve been struggling with for years. But here\\'s the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;\\nBeing medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you\\'re going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there\\'s actually very few mental illness that cannot be \"fixed\". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. \\nBut all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a \"thropy\" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it\\'s not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what\\'s the point in knowing that you\\'re a DID system if you\\'re not going to take the time to become apart of those \"singlet\" people that you love insulting so much? \\n\\nSelf diagnosis is invalid. Thank you for reading my rant.', 'I think my friend is faking Derealization Hi my names K and I’m not an expert on mental health (not even gonna pretend I know all about did ptsd etc) but my one “friend” has a history of faking things such as depression anxiety and hearing voices or having auditory hallucinations. And right now they say that they are a anime character and they believe that they are Sebastian from black butler and some characters from danganropa and that if anyone says “wow I don’t think that’s how it works” they get defensive and call them ableist. They have shown me pictures of anime characters and claiming that it’s them brings around a copy of black butler and will point out pictures and say that “they look so cute” it’s honestly really cringey. My boyfriend doesn’t believe them at all and of course they bring it up to me complaining and telling me to break up with him because he’s a terrible person. I knew exactly what he texted their friend and I have no problem with it but I really don’t know if their faking this because as I do have depersonalization and DID I honestly can’t tell because mine has never been like this and was hoping for some insight also sorry if my grammar or spelling is wrong English isn’t my first language.', 'Some possibly-overlooked points I know that there’s already tons of discussion threads about self-diagnosis already, but I want to talk about a few points I think get inadequate attention:\\n\\n“Diagnosis” implies *certainty*; doctors only make a diagnosis when they are *reasonably* *certain* of the situation. But if you’re evaluating yourself, you cannot ever be *reasonably* certain, as self-bias is unavoidable (professionals can’t even treat their friends and family because that’d be a conflict of interest). You can say you *suspect* you have something because “suspect” means you are open to the opinion of the professionals.\\n\\nWhen it comes to psychology and neurology, self-diagnosis is *never* okay. Not even for the “simpler” diagnoses like depression or anxiety. Simple physical ailments can be okay to self-diagnose as the evidence is more tangible, but psychology can be so intangible and convoluted that you can very easily be steered wrong. Think about it; how can you tell *for* *sure* if what you have is clinical depression or a bout of sadness? An anxiety disorder or an abnormal amount of stress? AVPD or apprehension towards social situations? You have no baseline to compare your experience to! \\n“But what about DSM-5 criteria?” You can stare at the criteria all you want—you’ll never be able to overcome self-bias. It’s disturbingly easy to see yourself in the criteria. You’d need to have someone else who can view your situation though an objective lens and analyze it with the DSM-5. The DSM is helpful and informative, but it omits a lot of the nuance around the disorders that professionals can keep in mind.\\n\\nIf you defend self-diagnosis because you believe that professionals are misguided and cold-hearted, you should stop relying on the DSM-5 to evaluate yourself. Because guess who’s responsible for it? And while we’re at it, guess who’s responsible for all the research on the very same disorders you believe you have?\\n\\nAnother defense of self-diagnosis is that you know your mind better than the professionals. And that’s half-true; you know your personality and habits better than anyone, and that’s why therapy sessions are spent asking and answering questions like in an interview. Professionals know much more about how minds work *in* *general*. You might know what your personality and habits are, but professionals know more about what might be happening behind the scenes that explains them.\\n\\nThe most common grievance people voice to back self-diagnosis is that professional intervention is expensive. One option being inaccessible doesn’t automatically make the other option okay.\\n\\nHow self-diagnosis and psychology misinformation harms actual sufferers gets lots of attention, but I think we overlook how it harms disorder fakers themselves. Self-diagnosing can put them in boy-who-cried-wolf situations, meaning that when real problems crop up, they may not be taken seriously. No matter how the internet can make it look, self-diagnosis is still unpopular in the grand scheme of things, especially among older adults and professionals. In general, professionals have lost patience and empathy towards their patients/clients because of all this, which affects everybody, not just actual sufferers. \\n\\n**A few extra things:**\\n\\n“Disabled” is not an ableist slur. I’m Deaf (which, of course, means I’m disabled), and I think it’s a perfectly fitting descriptor of people with **disabilities**, which include psychological disorders. (And if you think “disorder” is ableist, take a good look at the disorders you might claim to have: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity **Disorder**, Autism Spectrum **Disorder**, Obsessive Compulsive **Disorder**, Dissociative Identity **Disorder**, and so on.) Disabilities are called so because they make it harder to get by in life in some way—this is the common denominator of **all** disabilities. If your supposed disorder does not get in the way of life, it’s very unlikely you have a disorder. \\nThis is why it irks me to see people describing their “disorders” or other “disabilities” like they’re superpowers. There can be advantages, but they’re outweighed by the disadvantages. Also, if you say your disorder isn’t a disability, why do you consider it ableist for others to speak out against you?\\n\\nYour fyp on TikTok isn’t showing videos relating to whatever disorder you think you have because you have it; it’s simply the algorithm showing you videos on topics you’ve shown interest in. And no, being interested in it doesn’t mean you have it. If that were true, professionals would be the ones with all those disorders.\\n\\nDisorder fakers and otherwise misinformed people will push the notion that professionals are cold-hearted and careless. A few here and there can be, but the vast majority of them became professionals in the first place because of a desire to learn about psychology and help people.', \"Bitches be like (copypasta) I have OCD, I have ADHD, I have ADD, I have Bi Polar, I have Depression, I have STDs, I have AIDS, I have broken bones, I have a spider bite, I have a rolled ankle, I have Autism, I have Aspergers, I have a bump on my head, I have rabies, I have diabetes, I have a cleft lip, I have a tapeworm, I have foot odour, I have dwarfism, I have migraines, I have anxiety, I have dementia, I have schizophrenia, I have PTSD, I have DID, I have munchausen's syndrome, I have water on the brain, I have a glass eye, I have smooth brain, I have three balls, I have one kidney, I have half brain, I have occasional thirst, I have tiredness at night, I have a unibrow, I have melanoma, I have osteoporosis, I have lack of white blood cells, I have acidic blood, I have lycanthropy, I have vampirism, I have rock joint, I have deafness in one ear, I have no sense of taste, I have a peg leg, I have scurvy, I have frostbite, I have third degree burns, I have a knife in my abdomen, I have a hook for a hand, I have a displaced anus, I have different coloured eyes, I have illiteracy, I have anorexia, I have bulimia, I have a horse-sized penis, I have the attention span of a three year old, I have a Reddit account, I have PhD, I have CBT, I have BBW, I have BBC, I have an extra finger, I have an extra toe, I have vertical asscheeks, I have a third arm, I have receding hairline, I have lack of testosterone, I have abundance of estrogen, I have a fedora, I have an anime figure collection, I have amiibos, I have a $15,000 gaming PC, I have the mind of a dinosaur, I have a lightbulb up my ass, I have bladder stones, I have kidney stones, I have impotency, I have cloven feet, I have calluses, I have 12 children, I have a snake bite, I have distasteful tattoos, I have piercings on every inch of my skin, I have IKEA furniture, and finally, I have a dislike of tomatoes.\", 'About Eizawolfe and Stigma If you\\'re here on this subreddit from her recent TikTok, I want you to hear me out.

However, you cannot receive treatment if you have not been diagnosed by someone that\\'s QUALIFIED to make a diagnosis. YOU are not qualified to diagnose yourself. Even if you were a doctor, you could not diagnose yourself. Even if you have a family member who is a doctor, they cannot diagnose you. This is because of ethics, which are purposefully put in place to protect patients. \\n\\nThere is a reason why doctors have to go through such rigorous schooling. There is a reason why they need to be updated on research. There is a reason why many of them conduct research themselves. This is so they can learn to properly DIAGNOSE and TREAT patients. \\n\\nAre there bad doctors out there? Yep. Can doctors make mistakes? Yep. Can doctors be unsure of what to do? Yep. Does one type of doctor not know everything? Yep. \\n\\nThis is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.\\n\\n(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you\\'d think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it\\'s not.)\\n\\nNow that I\\'m done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I\\'m going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you\\'re reading this, perhaps you\\'d be willing to clear a few things up. \\n\\n(I\\'m going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)\\n\\n1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I\\'m not saying you can\\'t look up your symptoms and go, \"Hey maybe I\\'ve got this!\" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, \"But my therapist thinks I\\'m autistic and other doctors too!\" Doesn\\'t matter, they\\'re apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That\\'s why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. \\n\\n2. It\\'s entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn\\'t real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn\\'t have. What doesn\\'t make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. \\n\\n3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver\\'s test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. \\n\\n4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you\\'re paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I\\'m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn\\'t make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I\\'m likely to get bombarded with, \"but her health insurance doesn\\'t cover anyone else!!!!\" Definitely possible, but it\\'d be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that\\'s willing to diagnose you for that much money. \\n\\n5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you\\'re sitting in front of what you said was \"some random woman sleeping behind you.\" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there\\'s a whole lot of you going outside so... ???\\n\\nI can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I\\'ll save you some time. Yes, it\\'s possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn\\'t talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn\\'t make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that\\'d clear things up. It\\'s public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. \\n\\nNote: Don\\'t go harass her on Instagram. \\n\\nA lot of things to make this long post even longer: \\nEizawolfe, you took people\\'s money for a diagnosis, I hope that\\'s actually what you\\'re using it for. I also hope you squash everyone\\'s suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you\\'re autistic, it\\'s not right to be speaking like you\\'re a part of a mistreated group of people when you don\\'t truly know if you\\'re a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we\\'re all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can\\'t speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren\\'t lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol \\n\\nIf anyone\\'s wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I\\'ve been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. \\n\\nAnd if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it\\'s 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don\\'t be shy. :\\') \\n\\nStay strong guys.', 'I used to have a friend who faked disorders and also faked being bsfs with my deceased friend. This would’ve been about 4-5 years ago. However to this day I still hear about her faking mental disorders. \\n\\nI met her (I’ll call her Z) through a mutual back in middle school and we became acquaintances at the time. She would sit in the corner and act all depressed and when I asked my (ex)friend what was wrong she said “oh yeah Z has cancer so she’s in pain right now,” which I mean, middle schoolers are stupid. The fact she is still doing this current day is more ridiculous than anything. \\n\\nA year after the “cancer incident” we became close friends and had a pretty big friend group because we all shared a class and started hanging out during lunch together. Z was fine until I went on a trip to California to see my grandparents and suddenly she confessed she liked me. I didn’t know what to say at the time so I just said “okay that’s cool.” She warned me and said that she had DID (she called it something else) and said she had multiple alters that would come out at different points and make her act different. I thought nothing of it at the time and just thought it was weird. I quietly rejected her, though. \\nZ used to tell my friend that we were holding hands and kissing on the bus despite us never having ever been on a bus together and she lived farther than me and used to have her parents drive her to school. She also used to confess her love to everyone else in the friend group, and saying the exact thing she did to me— DID and all. She convinced one of my friends so bad that it severely fucked her up for the next few years. I still think that she has trauma from the event. \\n\\nShe blamed her bad behavior and bullying within the friend group on her alters and mental disorders. So once one of my friends couldn’t take it anymore she decided to drop Z as a friend. A while after this, she passed away unexpectedly on a Saturday. I saw her about 6 hours before she passed away to get school work done. \\nZ decided to capitalize on her passing and use it as a way to garner attention, saying that she “was her best friend and used to hang out all the time,” which I and many others knew that wasn’t the case. They didn’t really hang out much after middle school. Z used to make fun of her and verbally abuse her in middle school, sucked that I couldn’t do anything about it. \\n\\nZ also used my friend’s death as a way to write college essays to schools, one of my friends proofread her paper and said it was one of the most putrid things he’s ever read. Really sucks that she’s been trying to garner attention by not only faking mental illness but by also using my friend’s death for sympathy points. \\n\\nZ also began to fake autism 2-3 years after my friend passed away, flaunting it around my friends and many others saying she had high functioning autism. She was completely aware that I had an autistic brother. There was one time I was at the library and I discussed my brother’s autism and she scoffed, “not like you’d know anything about that,” which… she’s the one faking so I’m sure I don’t know much but go off. \\n\\nShe then started to fake ADHD, taking pills and all. Apparently Z used to get all jittery and distracted when taking them which is not supposed to happen on those specific medications. \\n\\nWhen those were not giving her attention and people saw through, they just left her for good reason. She began faking DID again up til a few months ago. Not sure where she is now but I know she’s just going back full circle. \\n\\nWe made amends a while ago, though I don’t think I’ll ever forgive her for pretending to be best friends with my deceased friend and disrespecting her memory. Genuinely the worst thing she’s ever done is that and I can’t forgive her for that. Because we as a friend group knew what she did to her yet she continued to use her memory as a way to garner attention and get into colleges.\\n\\nThis is pretty long. Very all over the place. I feel the need to say something now because this is something that affected a lot of people not just myself. I hope Z grows but knowing she did all these things doesn’t give me much hope she’s gonna change and be better.', \"i'm going to be writing a paper on the faking of disorders and it's effect on the mental health community i just wanted to say that !! the content on this subreddit is INCREDIBLY valuable and important to my paper, im going to be working with some professors at my college on it, so we'll see how it goes!! keep posting y'all , help a girl out 💜\\n\\nquick addendum: if y'all have any videos or documents you know of by doctors who speak on this, send em my way please !!!!!! thank you all SO SO SO much for the support!!!!!\\n\\nedit 2: YALL ARE GONNA MAKE ME CRYYYYY the positivity and help y'all are giving me means. just the world to me, seriously. i'm so thankful. i hope i can write a paper y'all are proud of!!\\n\\nedit 3: I DID ACTUALLY CRY!! the support has been something out of like. a dream. there really are no words for how thankful i am for that. though the paper might take a bit, i am very happy AND excited to begin note taking as soon as possible. again, thank you all so so SO much.\", 'Can we please stop spreading misinformation? Just to clarify: absolutely none of this is to give any justification towards what fakers do. My only goal here is to provide correct information and sources so that when people do call out their bullshit behavior, it’s not done with incorrect information that negatively impacts the people that *do* suffer from whatever disease or mental illness these fakers have chosen to show how neurospicy they are.\\n\\nListen. I get it. People who are very obviously faking these disorders are extremely frustrating and cringe, and what they’re doing causes very real damage by contributing to negative stigma that already plagues people who actually *do* suffer with these illnesses. \\n\\nBut here’s the thing; when people make posts or comments here about how it’s not possible for BPD/DID/OSDD/whateverthefuck to be diagnosed at a specific age/as a comorbidity/doesn’t look like what is being presented, that’s doing the same damage and harm because *it’s not necessarily true*. \\n\\nFor those who may not know, health professionals in psychiatry utilize tools alongside tests for diagnosis criteria for mental disorders. DSM-V, ICD, PDM, HiTOP, RDoC, and the PTMF, but the most commonly used guide is the DSM-V. The DSM-V is the one most commonly used in the US, where as ICD is used in other parts of the world (these are used for communication between doctors and insurance billing as well). *Note: DSM-V is thought to be controversial, and as a correction from my previous statement, it is not used as a diagnostic tool, but moreso as a resource. Diagnosis is made after performing tests issued by doctors, but the results and measurements often align with the criteria listed within these guidelines*. \\n\\nHere’s the thing: While a mental disorder may be *rarely* be diagnosed at a specific age past typical age of onset, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible for someone to be diagnosed at that point. Additionally, [50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.](https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions) \\n\\nPlease, for the love of all that is holy, do your research. I get that Reddit is the dictionary definition of hivemind™️, but when you have the wealth of information at your fingertips, there’s little excuse for not doing your own research. Which for the record, is actually one of the rules of this subreddit. \\n\\nI understand that not many people are going to be spending $250 to obtain a record of the DSM-V, and nor would I recommend doing that. Because at the end of the day, unless you’re a trained doctor with more than a decade of education to understand the additional context that goes hand in hand with the diagnostic criteria, much of it will be gibberish to you anyways. But that doesn’t mean that you also can’t at the very least Google whatever information it is that your parroting. \\n\\nSome great resources to check out:\\n- [Child Mind](https://childmind.org/article/borderline-personality-disorder/)\\n\\n- [Peer reviewed psychiatric journals](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/)', \"I (kind of) faked a disorder for a short time a long while ago (former faker Friday if that's still a thing) I would like to mention before I begin that I was never really a full blown faker, never trying to play to the characteristics of my 'disorders', or talking about them to people (much). For a better explanation, just read it I guess :)\\n\\nSo, did anyone ever use [Quotev](https://www.quotev.com/)? Mostly it was a quiz site, where people could make quizzes of all types and share them. There was also a large portion of the user base that wrote stories, fanfiction, ect. However, it was behind the scenes where it started to get... odd.\\n\\nIn order to post, you had to make an account. In order to 'do' (take quizzes, read stories, ect) you didn't have to. So naturally, most people didn't. However, I was active on it and decided I'd like to make an account in order to comment on quizzes/stories, and interact with others. Naturally I won't be sharing the name of my old account, but a basic idea is that all account pages were extremely customizable, something along the lines of a MySpace page if you will. Observing other account pages, I noticed all of them involved long and detailed introductions to each person involving\\n\\n* Name(s)\\n* Pronouns\\n* Gender/sexuality\\n* Favourite colours\\n* Pets\\n* Personal details/facts (but not too personal to make it unsafe, more things like fun facts)\\n* A quote of some sort (to make the page creator look intelligent haha)\\n* An I/DNI list\\n* Links to the page of a friend or two\\n\\nSo, I tried my best to do this. I listed all of this information to the degree I was comfortable with, and then began to explore. And what I discovered was the fakest, cringiest, most toxic community I'd ever run across. Behind the scenes, you could do all sorts - make groups (similar to subreddits, actually) with friends, or join groups with people with common interests. I immediately joined several groups, with anything from 5-8,000+ members. On some of the largest groups, I can still remember the usernames of about 10 people who, I swear, used the platform for 15+ hours a day. I would make a post, and ALWAYS, they would just be there, to comment or to argue. Anyway, I was reasonably happy. It was fun, for a while. Until I started to go deeper.\\n\\nNow, as much younger as I was, I didn't really understand the concept of faking. All I saw, was people, all around me, all the time, constantly talking about their several complex mental disorders, even when it wasn't relevant to the conversation. Now, I had already listed my mental disorders, in a desire to copy the profiles of others I'd seen. I'd like to note here that I am clinically diagnosed with several moderate to severe mental disorders. Naturally, again, in the interests of privacy I will not be listing them all - only mentioning the ones relative to the story when they are. Anyway, almost every profile I saw started with an extensive list of mental disorders. I also saw a huge amount of pro self-dx, and DNI fakeclaimers/anti self-dx. So, not knowing better, I believed it, and began preaching these views to others. And, as time went on, I began to notice how sad my profile looked - how empty and plain. And, again younger as I was, I had only the foggiest clue of what different disorders meant/entailed. I have always experienced very distinct mood swings, due to severe ADHD. However, I didn't know at the time that that was the reason, so I presumed that it must be something else. As all the people around me were pro self-dx, I figured how bad could it possibly be? Therefore, I did MINIMAL research, and decided (more for the purpose of fleshing out my disorder list than anything else) that I must have bipolar, borderline personality, and for a short time, DID. DID turned out to be far too much work to fake, so I took that one off quickly. However, for a long time bipolar and borderline sat happily at the top of my list.\\n\\nFast forward, I never use Quotev anymore. It was toxic, everyone on there faked at least 3 mental disorders, and it was just generally awful. It also had a direct messaging system, where I know that many people were groomed. I recently deleted the fake disorders from my account, which is now completely dormant. The reason it took me so long was that I quite simply forgot. I am now very regretful of this short era of my life, and wish I could wipe it from my history forever. I hope that if anyone has bothered to read to the end that you can understand why I did what I did - simple peer pressure. Feeling like I wasn't 'disabled enough', like I wasn't good enough to be a part of this community. I think that my story sheds a bit of light on the reasons that some people may have for faking -  that thing of peer pressure and not belonging. I hope that in the future this kind of thing can not be allowed to go on.\", 'I faked being in a system and having psychosis. (VERY Long Post) I know this somewhat common a post and common a situation, but I believe everyone\\'s a fan of some change in pace here and enjoy seeing someone realize and admit that they were wrong. I will try to not give many details here, because I am VERY paranoid as this is a pretty recent development that I acknowledge I am a faker and have cut off those who encouraged me so I do not wish to give out any particular details. This is really embarrassing but I personally believe it\\'s healthy for me to write this down and let it go. I hope that writing this allows other former fakers to come out with stories of their own or helps someone realize it\\'s okay to admit you\\'re faking it and they can start to recover.\\n\\n**I am a former system faker and former faker of psychosis.**\\n\\nTo start off, I was a very chronically online kid and I learned about DID and systems from tumblr. **I was very eager as a lonely and bored kid so I had been very intrigued by the idea of being able to have basically what were imaginary friends that I could talk to. I studied up on all the system terms and information I could find on tumblr, teaching myself everything that came from people who glorified systems and misinformation.** I had known about systems and kin for a bit then and I believe at some point in middle school when I was about 13 I learned about systems and then learned about tulpamancy and tried to force myself to have alters calling them \"tulpas\" by just pretending I had them to talk to. My \"headmates\" as I called them were actually Jeff the Killer, Geno!Sans the skeleton, Killer!Sans the skeleton. I would draw Jeff the killer, calling him my older brother and pretend I was talking back and forth with Geno!Sans the skeleton in my head. **Eventually after about a week I quickly dropped them because it was really tiring to keep pretending to talk to nothing because it was so much work when I knew I could not really convince myself.**\\n\\nThen as of late since 2020 or 2021 as you can see the internet has quickly popularized the idea of \"IRLS\" and \"Delusional Attatchments\" or \"D/As\". **Of course, I like everyone else leapt gladly on the opportunity to find a way to be unique and different by claiming I was a unique fictional character and the only one there was.** I knew very much that I was faking this, but my first lie was in a new kin server that I had decided to join where they had a rather long \"No doubles IRL\" list. **It was at a time where a certain character had came out very recently and I wanted to \\'claim\\' him in my mind so other people wouldn\\'t do it first, so I had pretended that I was a IRL of him despite knowing I had no psychosis symptoms and was not psychotic. Since everyone else was an IRL and when you were an IRL in that server you were the ONLY person who could be that character, which made you unique. I had decided I needed to be one too since I wanted to be unique and fit in with this group because I liked talking to them so much.** When I made my friends refer to me as him I always felt super uncomfortable being called him because I knew I was not him and it was very weird to have it validated without question. Then with another character I wanted to be very unique in liking so I had claimed to be a \"IRL\" of him as well. I had picked this character because he was quite minor a character in the fandom (he was a rather unpopular Homestuck character) because I wanted to fit in and I knew that I could not pick to be an IRL or a Delusional Attatchment to another character as they were all already on the no doubles list, which to me meant that someone else had \\'claimed\\' them and they were \\'taken\\' so I and no one else could not have them. **I would lie about my psychosis and try to force myself into psychosis. I would search online for excuses for how I was \"psychotic\" despite having no real symptoms.** Claiming anything I saw was a hallucination and since the character was an animal I\\'d try to literally force myself to think that I was him and force myself to behave like an animal despite knowing that I was not. **I would purposely endanger myself and try to force my thoughts because I wanted so badly to be psychotic and knew that I was not. I would spend time googling disorders that had psychosis to say I could possibly self diagnose myself with to validate myself and my \"delusion\" and \"psychosis\" that I did not have. Incredibly unsurprisingly, once I left this server because it grew very inactive, I no longer felt the need to claim I was psychotic anymore nor was I an IRL or a D/A of the character and never mentioned any of it again.**\\n\\nOnce again since this was quarantine with lots more focus on the internet, more and more people started claiming to be systems even more widespread on twitter, tumblr and TikTok. **I knew that I had an ACTUAL dissociative disorder and once again I was a very lonely person who enjoyed fitting in. I would spend time researching information to self-diagnose and I would come across resources that I could only have one dissociative disorder and not multiple and be very angry because the information I found went against what I WANTED which was to be validated for the disorder I did not have. All found information supported me having an entirely different dissociative disorder (DR/DP disorder, and if you have DR/DP then you automatically cannot have DID or OSDD) but I would ignore it because it did not validate and agree with my desire for being a system.** At this time I was friends with a new group of people who I had enjoyed spending time with who most of them were claiming to be systems. I saw them bond over being a \"system\" and bond over their alters. I saw them fit in together having DSMP alters, undertale alters and FNAF alters. Being a system to them was a very important personality trait and was their main personality traits. **I wanted to belong. I knew that I was not a system, I could not be, but I claimed that my symptoms were OSDD. I claimed OSDD because I knew I did not fit the amnesia part of DID because I did not have DID and never did.** However soon I found myself using letter sign offs like \"-V\" at the end of my messages. I was aware that I was nervous to use pluralkit because I knew that I did not really think I should be using it. **However this friend group and other \"system\" servers that I was joining encouraged me to use pluralkit and call myself a system. When people started agreeing with my desire and validating it, I eagerly did not look back and quickly called myself a system.**\\n\\n**Like psychosis I quickly tried to FORCE myself to fit what I was told was a system.**  **I started to try to talk to nothing in my head, having back and forth conversations with \"voices\" in my head. I started trying to make them feel differently. I started having \"switches\" to characters that I never had before.** I will preface this by admitting that yes I AM an actual victim of abuse. When I would be yelled at and cried, I would hold myself and start telling myself that this was fine because it was an alter of Spinel from Steven Universe who was taking over and it was okay because we were \"switching\" now, and then get very frustrated and angry when nothing actually happened because there was no way for it to actually happen. **Despite knowing that I did not have DID I told myself I did because it made it easier to accept my life and how terrible my situation actually was.** **I started off very slowly, claiming to have only a few small amount of alters. Then very quickly I started to \"split\" more alters (all of which were fictives and factives)**. I had a \"factive\" of a popular artist on instagram (who was funnily enough an actual diagnosed system themself and I believe actually really a system so I had claimed that I had two factives of their already existing alters) and I know that I made them very uncomfortable with it (because I told them personally about it). **The \"factive\" I had of them was only because I thought that their aesthetic, appearance and art was very cool and I wanted it but didn\\'t know how to, so claiming to literally have them as a separate person in my head was a quick solution.**\\n\\nIn school and when I was bored I would tell myself I could instead pretend to be someone else fronting. I would tell my friends that I was a different alter and switching. I **started using those yellow \"nonverbal stim emotes\" because everyone else used them in servers and now all of a sudden I would claim that now I was nonverbal, age regressed or a little alter.** I dated someone who ALSO claimed to be a system with DSMP fictives. I claimed to have fictives of every Dream SMP character in my system, dream, technoblade, tommy, ranboo, tubbo, all of it. I claimed to have alters of Junko, Miu, Kokichi and Nagito. I claimed to have several sans the skeleton alters, chara, frisk, gaster and grillby alters. I claimed to have sollux, gamzee, jade, john and dave alters. **Most of my \"alters\" would \"front\" for only a day or two and then I\\'d move onto a new one, splitting instantly when I wanted to and then forget them. I found myself from a system with 4 members to over 80 in mere MONTHS, calling myself \"polyfragmented\" (when I had \"fragments\" only because I didn\\'t actually have alters). I would invent OCs and characters on the spot and then claim they were alters I had just discovered.** I would talk to other \"alters\" with the same \"source\" as me. I would claim my alters were speaking to each other and tell everyone the stories and things they said. My friends started talking to my \"alters\" and telling me how much they liked them. I started telling everyone I was a system, having statuses with our fronters and writing down things about them.  **I knew I had no \"headspace\", but I made one up because everyone else talked about how giant their \"headspace\" was and how they saw their alters interacting with each other and it was common in system spaces to talk about what fake activities your alters were somehow doing. I would get angry with myself because I had told myself I was a system, and the internet said all systems had magical headspaces, but I did not have one and I knew this. I could not make a headspace that I fully believed in and I knew this.**\\n\\n**As I said I am an actual victim of abuse and I am actually mentally ill, awkward and autistic. (just like most fakers likely are).** The only disorders that I mainly truly had were autism (making me feel very weird and like I did not fit in), OCD (causing my compulsions and mental health paranoia) DR/DP (causing 99% of my dissasociation symptoms), bipolar and BPD **(making my emotions feeling so very extreme I would say they were my \"alters and that my emotions were different people). I wanted to fit in and as I had never really had much of a certain identity (because I was a young uncertain teen discovering myself that wanted to join in the trends that everyone else did combined with actually having no sense of myself from my BPD). I was a very lonely kid who\\'s main comfort was the internet and spent hours and hours daily on it and using discord and tumblr, so I was beyond deeply influenced by it. I wanted to know what was \"wrong\" with me, so spending my time self diagnosing mental disorders was very coinvent for me and something I relied on. I would hyperfixate on researching one mental disorder and slowly convincing myself that clearly I had it. I did this for SPD, SzPD, ASPD, OSDD, DID and BPD where I would research to the point I started gaslighting myself unintentionally that I had these disorders because their symptoms \"made sense\" and it gave me comfort. I wanted an \"answer\" to what was wrong with me so badly, and I wanted a way to be unique and stand out in a way that was my identity that I so often would self diagnose myself. I did not use self diagnosis for anything except to reassure myself in my faking and what I knew was wrong. I had no interest in actually healing or getting better, I just used them as a way to fit in.**\\n\\nI felt after saying I was a system that I could never go back to before. **No one ever talks about what you\\'re supposed to do if you realize that you\\'re not a system after all. They tell you how to find out that you\\'re a system, or what to do about it. They talk to your new alters and coddle you and make you feel good and make you feel as if you only matter and fit in when you\\'re one of them. I felt like I couldn\\'t do anything, because now that I had said I was a system I could not go back. I felt as if I told people I didn\\'t think I was a system after all that I would be humiliated and that they wouldn\\'t want to speak to me anymore because I wouldn\\'t \"fit in\" with them anymore. I had so many friends and servers where the only thing we had in common was our \"mental illness\" and if I didn\\'t have that, then they would realize I had no use to be talking to them anymore and that nothing would matter after all, because all our interests, conversations, rants, jokes and memories involved about how mentally ill we were and how we were so different from \"singlets\" and unique.**\\n\\nNow I am nearing my age of adulthood and have no interest in things like this anymore. I use this subreddit to make sure that I accept that I could never see myself going back to living like that anymore. I have left all friends who influenced me to claim the disorders, left all communities and spaces for being a system, left all system information behind and started meeting new friends who are not calling themselves systems and who will call out fakers and do not validate just anyone at random. I\\'m soon to be in recovery as well. I am excited to genuinely start therapy and medication and I no longer have interest to start collecting my mental illness self diagnoses like pokemon cards and am very excited for professional diagnosis. I have started finding interests and parts of my identity that make up me as one entire person instead of using my mental illness as my only trait. I look back on this very shamefully and am deeply embarrassed admitting all of this. I am fully staying away from anyone who looks to be doing the same things I did and picking my friends and communities very carefully.\\n\\n**I hope anyone in a similar situation knows it\\'s okay to want to change it. You can take the first steps you need to, no matter how slowly. You can leave all the people who encouraged you behind (because that community is beyond toxic of a space to be in, take it from me), or tell real friends that you don\\'t think you actually have these disorders anymore and they should accept you for it and praise you for taking that step of self admittance. Get better. Be honest right now, and notice that people in these spaces NEVER recover or push for recovery and healing for themselves or for others. All they do is echo each other\\'s opinions, encourage their disorders to be worse to be better than one each other and refuse to change. I could not heal and recover until I cut all of this out and decided to change for myself. You can and will find yourself as a person in what you really like and are interested in and what you enjoy doing, not in your mental illness. You do not have to live like this forever, and it will get better! I am beyond happy with what I\\'ve done, and I cannot see myself doing that ever again.

This is the trajectory of a medical fad. DID was based on poorly conceived theories and used potentially damaging treatment methods. The problem continues, given that the DSM-5 includes DID and accords dissociative disorders a separate chapter in its manual.\\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sybil Exposed\": Memory, lies and therapy\\nhttps://www.salon.com/2011/10/16/sybil_exposed_memory_lies_and_therapy/\\n\\nHow three women fabricated the most famous case of multiple personality disorder and damaged thousands of lives\\n\\n_______________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy DID or MPD is a Bogus Diagnosis\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-well/201112/why-did-or-mpd-is-bogus-diagnosis\\n\\nThe fact that the mental health establishment reclassified MPD as DID indicates that the very concept of the disorder is unstable, open to debate, and hard to pin down.

I\\'m always amazed at seeing how many diagnosed individuals seemingly support this behaviour, excusing it with the extremely flawed \"they don\\'t cause any harm\" sentiment. Misinformation is so common nowadays, and there is already enough stigmata on mental illnesses and neurodevelopmental disorders in existence. Fakers just love speaking for everyone sharing their \"diagnosis\" (e.g. \"Infantillisation doesn\\'t affect me, it\\'s just an inside joke/\"I want to be infantilised\"), and calling them out is forbidden in some of these subreddits, because it\\'s of course ableistic behaviour. They are also the ones spreading toxic positivity, such as calling their disorder a super power, using \"neurospicy\", as well as blaming our modern/western/capitalist society for all of their issues. They don\\'t give a duck about the harm their opinions may cause affected individuals. Because once their puberty ends and they realise that they in fact do not suffer from DID, BPD, ASPD, ADHD or autism (but from being chronically online, boredom, identity instability), most of them will be able to just walk away and never look back.\\n\\nWhat\\'s worse, I\\'ve seen people advocating for self-diagnosing via TikTok, portraying it as a legitimate source of information, in these communities. There\\'s seemingly no space for people with a more \"mature\" view on this issue, you either have to co-exist with people larping as the bane of your existence or gtfo out of all supportive groups. Do you guys think that the acceptance and tolerance for self-dx\\'ing will fade away? I\\'m feeling pretty pessimistic myself lol', 'An observation about fakers. **Recently someone posted a survey on this sub in which they asked why we think people fake disorders/illnesses. I wanted to share my response to this question with a wider audience, and ask your opinion(s) on it.**\\n\\n**My mini-essay is as follows:**\\n\\nWhen it comes to adolescents (the primary group of people faking), I believe a large majority of it is actually unintentional faking. While there are certainly a numerous amount of people who fake illnesses for attention, there is an even larger amount of people who have deluded themselves into genuinely believing they suffer from said illnesses. Since it is currently among the most commonly faked illnesses and I also have personal experience with people who are faking it or have faked it in the past, I\\'ll use (fake) Dissociative Identity Disorder in adolescents as an example:\\n\\nMost people spend a huge portion of their teenage years trying to figure out who they are. This often results in lots of change, — whether intentional or not — to oneself in order to fit into a group and/or be socially accepted. They don\\'t feel like themselves, and they\\'re confused, so they look around online to get an idea of what\\'s \"wrong\" with them, and among the results find DID.  Because of their exposure to the internet\\'s limitless information, alongside (inaccurate) media portrayals such as the movie *Split*, they have likely already been introduced to Dissociative Identity Disorder and are more likely to gravitate towards it because it\\'s familiar. So, they pull up a symptoms checklist — and when they check off all or most of said symptoms, they assume they have the disorder because they don\\'t have enough experience nor education in the medical field to understand that having symptoms doesn\\'t necessarily mean you have a specific disorder (as an example, people commonly check off every symptom of a concussion even if they\\'ve never had one).\\n\\nTeenagers who grew up on the internet have a tendency to latch onto labels due to the fact that the internet is so heavily segregated into communities. An example of this is sexual orientation and gender; people will cycle through a multitude of labels because they crave somewhere to fit in and be accepted. The same goes for DID — the universal fear of the unknown (\"what\\'s wrong with me\"), in combination with a fixation on labels, leads them to the idea of having DID.  As a result of latching onto these labels, they begin feeling a need to amplify their \"symptoms\" in public as proof that they have the disorder. This results in the heavily exaggerated stereotypes often seen on TikTok and other social media platforms where people tend to fake disorders.\\n\\nAnother issue stemming from these children growing up online is the fact that making a mistake, big or small, is treated as a cardinal sin because it is permanently attached to your character; everything is permanent on the internet. General teenage mistakes we used to take for granted are no longer possible for these teenagers. They can\\'t learn from their mistakes because they aren\\'t allowed to make any. They don\\'t have the life experience necessary to reflect on what they\\'re doing and admit their faults. Their primary role models tend to consist of influencers who have taught them that finding excuses and moving on is better than finding explanations and changing their behaviour.\\n\\nAll of these factors combined result in the faker drawing out the act for as long as they possibly can, which often leads to them being mocked, which further leads to an even stronger desire to stay in this delusion. When the validity of a faker\\'s disorder is inevitably brought into question, they naturally tend to lash out because admitting that they were wrong would send them back to square one (not to mention that it is much more comforting for someone — especially an adolescent who is rarely taken seriously by adults — to remain wilfully ignorant than to confront the idea that they might be wrong about something). This is why the influx of social echo chambers is so prominent on social media right now, especially Reddit and TikTok.\\n\\nOverall, *none of these things* excuse the misinformation and mockery created by fakers. It\\'s incredibly disappointing to see and I sincerely hope that they can learn to accept when they make mistakes, admit their faults, and learn from them. This is simply an observation I\\'ve made, and it could possibly serve as an explanation as to why faking mental disorders is such a widely spread phenomenon on the internet.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m curious as to what you guys think of this. Do you think faking is a result of these factors, or something else? Would you argue that most online faking is intentional/malicious? If so, why?Hoping to spark some insightful discussion :)\\n\\n*^(edited to fix a grammatical error)*\\n\\n*edit: thank you for the gold!*', \"Rant about a faker in my school's neurodiversity society TL;DR Faker keeps showing up to my school's neurodiversity society and expects us to coddle her and agree that she struggles so much more than us.\\n\\nMy school has an invite-only (diagnosis = invite) neurodiversity society with around 8 regular members that meet each week to talk about coping strategies for learning disabilities, what we're up to and stuff like that. The invites are managed by staff but it's student-run. For the past few weeks, a faker (with ASD, ADHD, OCD, anxiety and dyslexia - all self-diagnosed) has been showing up unprompted and derailing any chance of actual conversation. She harassed my friend until he told her where we met and when we suggested she leave (very politely considering), she said we were all classist and homophobic, and she wasn't going to move. Afterwards, she complained to my friend that we didn't understand how hard she has it and that we didn't ask any questions - was she expecting to show up and recount her life story?\\n\\nEven though we've gotten teachers to speak to her several times, she keeps showing up. We changed the meeting place but she complained to the head of student support that by excluding her we were breaking the law (by discriminating against her disability...). For the record, she isn't looking for a diagnosis, because she thinks doctors are misinformed and she understands more about mental illnesses than they do. \\n\\nIn the meetings, she constantly complains about how hard her disorders make her life and whenever someone suggests a management strategy she always shoots them down with 'Oh I've already tried that, but my \\\\[insert disorder here\\\\] is *much* worse than yours.' She accused me of cheating on exams for having access arrangements because she doesn't have them and she suffers so much more than me. I walked out and she tried to have me banned from the group because it really upset her when I didn't sit there and let her insult me. Ugh. Whenever anyone else speaks, she either interrupts to talk about herself or acts as bored as possible which means others are way less likely to contribute. The society is for ages 11-18 and it's really disheartening to see this 17-year-old take away a space 12-year-olds use to open up about their experiences and get advice...\\n\\nAnother thing - when she found out I was on medication she's been hounding me about giving her my prescription and just saying I lost it which- I don't have the words for how much it annoys me.

Some really interesting stuff and reinforcement that there is some investigation going on out there.', 'This is alarming Hi. I have a masters in clinical psych and am new here. First couple of publications were hilarious but as I was scrolling through this subreddit, the posts are getting more and more alarming. Even though it is *not* DID, these children do suffer from a mental health disorder, some sort of shared psychosis. I feel like this content could serve a study or something.\\n\\nEdit : you can read about “folie à deux”. Found that super interesting in this context.', 'faking illness isn\\'t always a sign of mental illness in itself This whole \"a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they\\'re faking\" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they\\'re doing and still want to feel validated for it. \\nLet me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who\\'s probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. \\nOf course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. \\n\\nSee, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. \\nBut while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. \\n\\nIt first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don\\'t need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it\\'s easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing \"depressed\" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today\\'s teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren\\'t. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. \\n\\nThen we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I\\'m not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that\\'s as far as my memory goes and I\\'d appreciate elaboration. \\n\\nNow, it\\'s important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it\\'s not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I\\'m sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as \"damaged\". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. \\n\\nToday, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It\\'s actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you\\'re born with it, it\\'s not developed from trauma... \\nBut anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn\\'t identify as that) you talk to chances are she\\'s gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it\\'s actually so wide spread that it\\'s unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I\\'ve tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It\\'s incredibly depressing, and it\\'s a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word \\'depressing\\' just now, it\\'s no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you\\'d be looked down on it for because you don\\'t have a mental illness that implies that you\\'ve went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don\\'t even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that\\'s developed from lots of trauma and it\\'s kind of just assumed that you\\'re living a \"hellish life\".\\n\\nNow back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they\\'re in. It\\'s just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. \\nYou\\'re not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that\\'s causing you to be an attention seeker. You\\'re faking because it\\'s simply what everyone around you is doing, it\\'s what\\'s deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it\\'s what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. \\nThat does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren\\'t the reason they\\'re faking. \\nAnd that\\'s honestly not even those teens\\' faults. I\\'m sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it\\'s important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. \\n\\nThese people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you\\'ve been struggling with for years. But here\\'s the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;\\nBeing medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you\\'re going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there\\'s actually very few mental illness that cannot be \"fixed\". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. \\nBut all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a \"thropy\" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it\\'s not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what\\'s the point in knowing that you\\'re a DID system if you\\'re not going to take the time to become apart of those \"singlet\" people that you love insulting so much? \\n\\nSelf diagnosis is invalid. Thank you for reading my rant.', 'No, not every quirky person is automatically neurodivergent First off, I\\'m aware that representation can be extremely important to some people, and of course personal headcanons are mostly fine. That said, has anyone else noticed the trend where popular, somewhat quirky, weird or \"outcast\" characters are diagnosed to have some sort of neurodivergency (in particular autism) by the internet? It may seem like innocent fun, but it\\'s actually pretty harmful, as it stereotypes neurodivergent people as being edgy weirdo loners, while also being an incentive for impressionable folks (especially younger individuals) who find a certain character relatable to take a deep dive into the world of self-diagnosing and mental health tiktok/twitter. Behaviours and characteristica that may be present in disordered individuals to a pathological degree, but are also common in neurotypical people (yes, even a neurotypical Nancy can be eccentric or introverted), are seen as stereotypical traits for neurodivergent people, and any popular fictive (and even real) person exhibiting them will automatically be interpreted as \"having a bit of the \\'tism\", while they completely ignore that neurodivergent and mentally ill people come in all shapes. Another issue associated with this is the infantillisation of nd people. Perhaps I\\'m taking it a bit too seriously, but it bothers me so much how obvious stereotypes are being reinforced before my eyes. Representation matters, but not every quirky and non-conforming character is automatically disordered. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry if this topic isn\\'t relevant enough to this subreddit, but there\\'s an enormous overlap between people who self-diagnose and people who behave like that. Both behaviours are partly built on extreme stereotypes, and both reinforce these stereotypes in people\\'s heads.', 'Roommate apparently have 100+ alters I don’t really know what to think of this, I would like to know y’all´s opinion on the subject.

The year is 2003. \\n\\nAt the time, our jr. high school goes from grades 7-9. \\n\\nWe have a 7th grader who I will refer to as Vic. I don\\'t know his full story but he lives with foster parents and has DID and possibly a slew of other problems. \\n\\nVic has a secondary identity named \"Skippy\". When Skippy comes out (Fronted, according to Tumblr) then Vic basically loses that whole day. Skippy is violent. Very violent. He once put a kid in the hospital, and Vic remembers none of this. \\n\\nBut because Vic does not get in trouble for things that he does as Skippy, people get an idea. \\n\\nOver the course of 2004-2006, a bizarre mental phenomenon occurs in the Jr. High. Students with no history of mental illness suddenly start developing dissociative identity disorder. They would misbehave and then tell the principal and teachers something like \"No that wasn\\'t me. That was Louis\", or suddenly start claiming they were another person entirely who had no memory of what they did.\\n\\nThe best one was, according to our friend the Biology teacher, Rosa. Suddenly a girl stands up and starts leaving class. When the teacher asks what the heck she is doing, the girl speaks in Spanish with an American accent and insists she is really a 20 year old Mexican woman. \\n\\nIf I recall correctly there was a south park episode about Tourettes syndrome where cartman faked it. This may have spurred on the outbreak of Munchausen\\'s Disorder that manifested in fake DID, since after all... Vic didn\\'t get in trouble for things Skippy did. At least once a year during the mid-late 00s, you would hear some kid randomly scream swear words and insist it was Tourette\\'s. \\n\\nFortunately the faculty had absolutely none of this. Because these kids all had an almost Tumblresque understanding of their alternative identities. Kids had as many as eight identities that they would wear at any time. But no matter what they would get in trouble because they would find some way to justify punishing \"The body\" and not the \"identity\" who was responsible for misbehaving. \\n\\n\\nThis sadly does not have a happy ending for Vic. :( Last I heard he had flunked 9th grade (Hence why I did not see him in my senior year of high school.) because he apparently started to lose entire weeks. People bullied the snot out of him. He apparently got worse and worse and last I heard lives in a mental care facility. \\n\\nbut he would live on as causing a DID outbreak.', 'Have these kids really done no research about DID? I’m not a medical professional. take anything i say with a grain of salt. \\n\\nFirst of all, they all claim to know exactly who their alters are with some depth at about 14-20. This is a major sign that they are faking. Personality states do not become distinct or fully formed until much later in life, if at all. Therapy usually slows down the process of this if the person struggling with it realises they might have something wrong with them and seeks help. Because of the amnesia barriers, they still wouldn’t know who the alters are and wouldn’t be able to communicate with them. So, they wouldn’t know their gender identity or pronouns or mental illness or whatnot. (Note: There can be some level of communication between alters, but that is also really rare because of the amnesia).\\n\\nAnother thing these fakers do is claim each alter has different mental illnesses or conditions. Again, this is a red flag. Although not much research has gone into this disorder because of how incredibly fucking rare it is, the research that has been done shows that a personality state could have a different mental illness than what the “body” has, but not neurological conditions. The brain is incredibly unique, but it has the same structure no matter who’s fronting. Since tourette’s syndrome, for example, is a result of the brain structure being different or “warped”, another alter would still have it. The alter may cause amnesia/memory loss but there is an extremely minuscule chance it would change the brain structure every time they fronted too. I have seen some people posted on this subreddit who also claim different alters can be paralysed from the waist/neck down when other alters don’t.. and wtf? Were they not taught body autonomy? \\n\\nThis is basic knowledge, but no, you can’t transfer your alters to another system. It’s not pokémon cards. You can’t trade them, you can’t have copies of them, just no. \\n\\nAnother thing that’s widely debated amongst medical professionals is fictives or irls or whatever these “systems” call them. Fictives do exist, but they are extremely rare and if one were to form, it would be before or around the age of 8 and would’ve taken multiple years, no Arson, not two years, two years isn’t long enough for your dream smp alters to form, it would’ve taken from around 8 years or more to form them. Fictives are formed when the brain latches onto a character that it thinks could protect them from harm and from the trauma that even caused their disorder. \\n\\nThis brings me onto my last point: endogenic systems. To put it simply; they aren’t real. You can have an imagination without claiming to have a severe lifelong traumatic disorder (minus the trauma in endogenic systems) and no one is going to attack you. DID is formed by multiple years of severe trauma, around or before the age of 8. It’s not your mom yelling at you to do your chores, it’s severe trauma. It’s trauma severe enough that the brain believes the original personality state would only be of harm if they remembered it, so it created other personality states that could take in the trauma. \\n\\nOne teensy last thing worth noting, you can’t switch alters on command. Alters switch when there is a negative trigger, that is a trauma response. It is kind of like how if someone with PTSD had a trigger of their trauma then they’d have a breakdown, except someone with DID would switch alters really subtly and then switch back when the threat is gone or over. You just can’t have a positive trigger either, because you wouldn’t know what each alter likes unless you were informed by a family member or your therapist. \\n\\nBefore I post this I wanted to say that every DID system is of course different, and if any GENUINE ones need to fix something i’ve said in the comments I will change my wording. I, myself, do not have DID so i can’t speak on behalf of the community, but this is just what i’ve found through research. \\n\\nSources: \\nDissociative disorders - NHS \\n\\nhttps://www.mind.org.uk › dissociati...What are dissociative disorders? - Mind \\n\\nhttps://www.sane.org › dissociative-i...Dissociative identity disorder (DID)\\n\\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com › dis...Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID): Symptoms, Traits, Causes, Treatment\\n\\nEDITS: \\n\\nFictives can form in the space of a year or more, but the amount of trauma that would’ve been caused then would’ve not allowed them to realise.

A large amount of trauma.', 'diagnosing factitious disorder I’ll start this post by saying I lurk in this sub way too frequently….both out of interest and sheer horror. I’m an undergrad psych student who’s interested in pursuing a career in therapy, and seeing how prevalent it’s become for teens / young adults to essentially put on an elaborate façade that they’re struggling with a dissociative disorder is concerning to say the least. I’m just wondering how a mental health professional would address a client behaving like this? There’s obviously some form of mental turbulence underlying these people’s desire to fake having d.i.d (whether it be attention seeking or lacking a sense of identity) but how would a counselor attempt to convince them that’s not the disorder they actually have? We’ve discussed the concept of “reactance” in my counseling classes, which makes me concerned that they would essentially double down on their unfounded belief of having d.i.d when confronted that they’ve been faking. Do you guys have any thoughts / ideas about this? Thanks!!:)', 'The DSMP community absolutely desecrating the progress and stigma reduction for DID/OSDD 🥴 For the last few years more and more of these DSMP alters/systems have been popping up and making a mockery of DID/OSDD. There can never just be one and they do these source/canon calls like people do with kin. It\\'s a game to them\\n\\nI\\'m not doubting that these kids have been through things. And there\\'s always a chance of being wrong which is healthy to acknowledge. Growing up in a pandemic, so many political issues, plus whatever personal trauma may cause these behaviors. But it does take repeated, SEVERE early childhood trauma to develop DID/OSDD to an extent most will never experience, even some badly abused kids. A DSMP introject isn\\'t impossible per se but it\\'s not very likely or something that makes sense to happen at this frequency or even close to it. A child likely wouldn\\'t need to develop the whole DSMP cast to survive\\n\\nThe positivity post is wholesome but it does take so much to develop dissociative disorders. Though pwDID do undermine their own trauma oftentimes, a post like that won\\'t likely apply to them unless their trauma came from elsewhere (not parents/family)\\n\\nBut for such a horrendous disorder they treat these alleged introjects like novelties, all acting in character. It\\'s all like one big party trick and not much different from kin to them. This is extremely rare with other fandoms, maybe sometimes BNHA and Homestuck get treated similarly but DSMP is on another level. And if you ever met an introject of any of these sources, they probably wouldn\\'t tell you\\n\\nAnd \"comfort/hyperfixation/ASD\" is not a reason for a bunch of characters to appear with their wacky hijinks and funny banter. Most introjects are of real people, abusers. They can take on persecutory roles, reenacting some of the worst trauma of your life- as opposed to reenacting your favorite Owl House scenes\\n\\nAlters may do horrible things to their bodies and think they are evil, they may sabotage recovery, they may be SEVERELY brainwashed to always return to their abuser(s). They can destroy friendships, relationships, education, and life opportunities. Over 70% of pwDID actively attempt suicide at some point. There are many comorbidities both physical and mental so these people often suffer from many other things they\\'re often not self dxing but have no choice other than to get help/dxed due to how debilitating symptoms are\\n\\nI want the people doing things like this to know all this because I truly mean them no harm but this is dangerous and harms so many people. People who think they\\'re freaks and monsters and crazy as they watch these 15 year olds proudly and openly claim to have dozens of DSMP alters. Read the DSM-V section for DID titled \"Factitious disorder and malingering\" because the consistencies are uncanny', 'Why there are so many people who are endogenic or faking DID/OSDD (speculation) From witnessing one too many instances of endos/\"non-disordered systems\" twisting medical words and their meanings, all using outdated resources that casually cite racist ideologies within it, I decided to dive more into the terms they\\'ve thrown around when \"proving validity\".\\n\\nMost of their terms they sprinkle into their arguments are \"multiplicity, plural; non-traumagenic, non-disordered, and no-amnesia\". With the latest 2020s flood of \"systems\", endos took this opportunity to whittle down their self-identified terms to \"multiplicity, plural; no memory of trauma\" to convert impressionable youth into their pro-endo ideology while the DID/OSDD community take the fall.\\n\\nWhy I believe this is due to taking note of these repeated terms. I first find them in these \"sources proving endo validity\" they share in the masses, and then do research into those terms within the context of \"systems\". Their \"plurality\" flows with normal socialized human behavior, meaning they\\'re already trying to blur the line between normal and complex disorder. Unfortunately being successful from how many vulnerable youth they\\'ve tricked and the large amount of fakers.\\n\\nThe concept that these people are describing is called \"multiple self-aspects\". Multiple self-aspects is the normal flow of human life everyone has. A \"non-disordered system\" (endos and fakers) would have a constant normal and expected flow between places, relationships, and scenarios (ex: Sarah is a student and timid when at school, Sarah is a lover and flirty to her partner, Sarah is calm and reserved at a restaurant, etc.). A DID/OSDD system would have varied results due to the amnesia and different selves formed from trauma, especially if there\\'s trauma relating to specific places, relationships, and scenarios. Those with other disorders may also have a choppy or lightly unpredictable flow, but that itself doesn\\'t mean they\\'re the same as a DID/OSDD system. I suggest reading a bit of the document below for starters.\\n\\n[multiple self-aspects](http://allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/whatistheself-soccog-2012.pdf)', 'DID Faker who\\'s alters also played LARP as themselves? Long time lurker here and I have a lovely story of a LARPER (Live Action RolePlayer) who spontaneously developed \"D.I.D.\" and subsequently created characters for them to play in the games. \\n\\nOkay so a little background info on what this LARP group was. Without naming the company, it was a relatively small LARPing group where you created a character within their medieval story. About 50 odd people who show up at a football field and would pretend to be fairies, elves, orcs and much more while playing out a sort of plot.\\n\\nI worked for this company for about a year and through that time I watched the progression of this particular person\\'s (let\\'s call them Rose) supposed D.I.D. For the first 6-8 months they showed absolutely ZERO signs of any sort of dissociative disorder but they did get into lots or \"drama\" with others players as they always found something to be pissy about. Whether it be a person who roleplayed incorrectly or that people didn\\'t take any photos for them for the gallery, Rose was always the centre of many of the biffs within the community. \\n\\nRight at the peak of the tiktok D.I.D. trend (God I hate calling a mental disorder a trend 😒) Rose suddenly came out that they had D.I.D. They never saw a doctor or got an official diagnosis but insisted that they did indeed have this disorder. Within the first week of claiming this they said that they had 5 different personalities, not including themselves (the \"host\") and coincidentally, 3 of these personalities were three characters they had made already for LARP. They began demanding that we make a new sign in name for each of their alters within our system and would show up as their alter and be this alter both in and out of the game. \\n\\nThere was at least 5 occasions where they would be in the middle of the field (keep in mind this is a combat sport, everybody has foam weapons they use to battle) and would \"dissociate\" by staring off and ignoring the world around them. They had one friend who fed their delusion and would run over and yell at everyone that \"They\\'re dissociating! Back off! I\\'ve gotta take them off field!\" And would make a huge scene for this attention seeker. They would then go sit by the side of the field until they realised noone was paying them any mind and then run back on field again. \\n\\nIf anyone was wondering the alters consisted of a pink cat girl who was a travelling merchant, an Irish elven archer, a British all powerful demon, a Nordic Viking barbarian and a shapeshifting orc warlock. \\n\\nI left the company after a year because it was an extremely uncomfortable environment filled with grown adults having little drama biffs like highschoolers and of course, our little D.I.D. faker. I checked their socials recently and they no longer claim to have D.I.D. but they still LARP. \\n\\nMy advice? Don\\'t join a LARPING community in Australia, it\\'s fucking cringe.', 'Adults who defend self-diagnosing Minors. I personally find it so weird and alarming when grown adults will do anything in their power to defend and protect a self diagnosing minor(s) from being outed for being a faker. They\\'re always the same type of adults too - that have numerous \"quirky\" mental illnesses (self diagnosed of course) in their bios or have made 12 videos about it. I saw some comments last night on a TikTok where kids were openly admitting to being self diagnosed with DID and a grown person, who happens to be the creator of the post, was supporting them. When people would come out and expose the fact that the kids are lying, the creator would throw insults and get creepily defensive over the kids who are clear as day lying. The creator had claimed they know nothing about DID and don\\'t have it yet shamed anyone who did know about DID and would attempt to educate the creator which would cause the creator to delete peoples comments in an attempt to not let these self diagnosing minors who are lying see the reality of the disorder they\\'re faking. I don\\'t understand why some grown adults refuse to acknowledge this type of faking behavior and stop supporting it all together. What do they get from this? The approval of little kids online? It\\'s weird how this creator (who claims to be 25) strived for the approval and attention  from little 13+ years olds who are lying about having a rare disorder while supporting their delusional behavior. \\n\\nWhat do these grown people gain from this truly? I feel like there\\'s something a bit creepy about that.', \"I blame the increase of disorder fakers on Social Media Before I start rambling, I want to preface the following by saying I usually don't make statements as to whether or not people are faking disorders/illnesses (unless it's REALLY obvious), especially with autism seeing as it's a spectrum. But in some cases that's where the problem starts, the fact that because it's a spectrum or that the disorder is still not completely understood, it leaves the so called 'aesthetic' parts of the disorder open for serious exploitation, which is made infinitely easier through social media.\\n\\nIt's easier to believe your own lies when you have affirmation from others. And of course, most people are usually sympathetic when it comes to mental illnesses/disorders/disabilities, so there will always be people to validate them (often the fakers themselves). This results in a vicious circle of lies believed to be truth because of the constant affirmation through tik tok/twitter/tumblr comments sections. Then it no longer becomes a lie, it becomes a phase.\\n\\nThen there are those who will 'play up' certain symptoms for 'validation' until they fully believe it's a disorder. For eg) Getting goosebumps at a certain part of a song, then doing a little happy dance thinking it's a stim. Then get further influenced by researching ADHD/Autism etc, now they're buying fidget toys and thinking their favorite singer/movie/tv show is a hyper-fixation of sorts.\\n\\nNow, I understand the last part is actually how a lot of people discovered they were on the spectrum but there's a difference between discovering small behaviors over the years that (with proper research) turned out to be autism, and taking a particular behavior and exaggerating it to seem similar to the symptoms after research.These people are easier to spot because they usually tend to mimic the lower part of the spectrum despite being visibly a functional person. Obviously because it's more convincing to make an overt display of the lower spectrum symptoms rather than the more discreet symptoms which doesn't really come across much when they're recording themselves on Tik Tok.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'm not really sure how all this will come across, but I needed to put feelings on the influx of DID systems, Tourette's, Autism, ADHD/OCD etc videos into words. I know some might say it's because they're trying to normalize or to educate people on disorders, but that excuse is hard to believe when:\\n\\n1. They all have a particular look to them (art girls, colored hair, white, teens-mid 20s)\\n2. All of it is the positive/aesthetic/cute/child like aspects of the disorder and NOTHING else(I mean, in terms of autism, for something that's called a SPECTRUM, these girls all act the same)\\n3. Most of them are self-diagnosed.\\n\\nAll of this being said, I do appreciate those who do genuinely try to educate people on ALL aspects of mental illness and not just the parts that 'look good'. I'm probably saying what everyone has already said but I really had to put it in words for myself. It is annoying knowing that these people will eventually grow out of this phase while the damage to the credibility of mental illness has already been done to those who can't call it a phase. It puts everyone in a difficult situation especially now that people are trying to justify self-diagnosis. In VERY FEW cases, I can understand where it's necessary but I still disagree that it's a valid method.If you disagree or agree, please let me know your side. I'm always eager to see from other perspectives.\", \"I'm pretty sure one of my old friends is faking being a system So, for background, I have this friend who I've known since 4th grade. We'll call them 'J'. For the past couple years I've grown more distant from them because they're super toxic and have abused me in the past, but last week J contacted me and we started talking again and that's when they said they were a system. They also noted that they recently formed this system after one traumatic event... when they were 16...\\nI don't believe them at all. For one, I study psychology and mental illnesses and it is pretty much impossible to develop a system at 16. DID and OSDD are Dissociative disorders developed during early childhood from traumatic events. \\nAlthough most people believe it can develop later on in life, it doesn't. Most of the time people who are systems figure it out later in life since the brain makes it so that you live without knowing you are a system. It's really complicated and most psychologists debate about whether it's real or not, but it is. I've met people with DID and OSDD and I may get some crap about this but I'm also a system. A small one, and I don't brag about it because it sucks.\\nBut back to J. Since they said they found out recently, and they developed it at 16 (they're about to turn 17), I don’t believe them. I've known them for years and used to be at their house every day, and I have never noticed a personality switch or voice change at all. So that just makes it harder for me to believe their a system. And to add on to that, they are attention seeking because they never really got all the love they needed during childhood. I know they do actually have some real mental disorders, which I believe, but DID/OSDD-\\nyeah no. I don't believe it for a second. I even brought this issue up with one of my friends who is a system, and they also agreed it's a bit fishy and just sus over all.\\nSo yeah. That's my complaint.\", 'No Words, Just Disappointment A friend from high school reached out to me for the first time in a while. We weren\\'t close friends (and I use \"friend\" lightly), we just knew each other and talked occasionally. For the sake of privacy in this story, I\\'ll call my friend \"Marcus\". Marcus was an okay guy. We\\'ve had our ups and downs and fights. He had a bit of a short fuse in school and usually got fired up for any small inconvenience or when people called him out for being in the wrong. I\\'ve managed to keep contact with some people from high school to this day. Marcus reached out some time ago to catch up. We struck up a conversation about our plans for college and that he was going into his second year. Naturally, I ask him what he was majoring in and he replies \"psychology\". Hey, what a surprise. I\\'m also planning on majoring in psychology, so we talk about that. Somewhere in our conversation, we end up on the topic of mental disorders and I bring up the rise in people on TikTok faking serious disorders. In hindsight, I should\\'ve stopped the conversation at our majors and moved on to something else because Marcus began to try and diagnose me.\\n\\nI told him that I recently found out that my diagnosis for Bipolar Disorder was a misdiagnosis, and it turned out that I actually have BPD He tried to convince me if I had DID instead because of my \"personality changes\" in high school. To be frank, I don\\'t remember most of high school. I do remember some highlights where I just wasn\\'t myself or I shifted moods/\"personalities\" in an instant, but I\\'m very certain it isn\\'t because I have DID. I tell him that I don\\'t have DID and that it is a rare disorder, which led to what happened next.  \\nI know there\\'s a huge debate about whether DID is as rare as people say or if it isn\\'t, but that ignited the following conversation. He says it isn\\'t that rare anymore, which might be true but then again, I\\'m still studying so what do I know? He goes on to say that he had DID in high school and that he knew all about it and the signs and whatnot; how truly difficult it was to live with such a disorder and how I \"helped him get rid of it\".\\n\\nYep. You read that correctly. I \"helped him get rid\" of his DID. In high school, he never really brought up the topic of DID. A lot of us didn\\'t even know what it was at the time. And like I said before, we weren\\'t very close. We just talked here and there. He said he was so thankful to me for helping him through hard times and how I helped him \"climb out of DID\". I may not have a degree in anything at the moment, but I\\'m very certain that once you have a disorder like BPD or DID, it never, ever, ever goes away. It is lifelong and you have it until you die. Sure, it can get better over time with help, but it isn\\'t like the flu and disappears after a few days. I was so puzzled, I thought he had me legit confused for someone else at first, but no. He \\\\*was\\\\* talking towards me. I wanted to say right then and there that DID can\\'t go away just like that but I couldn\\'t. I don\\'t know what possessed me to bite my tongue but I had to leave the conversation just to process what I was just told.', 'Farewell to the Awareness Flair and Low Effort Text Posts - RULE CHANGES Hi everyone! There have been two important changes to our rules.\\n\\n# Low Effort Text Posts\\n\\nSince allowing text posts on this subreddit, we\\'ve heard some really interesting stories! :) We have also heard some extremely uninteresting and pointless stories. :( In order to cut down on some of the low-effort posts we\\'ve been seeing, we have made some guidelines regarding text posts.\\n\\nGoing forward, **all storytime posts MUST follow a legitimate storyline**. That means beginning, middle and end. \"My friend is faking, what do I do?\" is not a story. You also must provide insight into how you know the person being discussed is a faker.\\n\\n**All discussion threads must actually start a discussion**. \"Fakers are always white/trans/dyed hair/alt/etc\" is not a discussion, it is an observation. Do not make title-only posts, body text is required for a reason. If you want to start a discussion you need to start it by giving your own thoughts and opinions.\\n\\n# Awareness Posts\\n\\nAfter recent discussions among our mod team, it has been decided that we will no longer allow \"awareness\" style posts on the subreddit.\\n\\nThis means that you **cannot post yourself or others experiencing symptoms of a real disorder** to show \"what it really looks like.\" People can experience different presentations of the same disorder, so it is not really valuable to look at only one case. Also, many people feel that the only reason someone would post themselves on this subreddit is for a form of validation that they are not faking, which isn\\'t our job.\\n\\nThis also means you **cannot post informational videos or infographics about disorders**. Again, these are not credible sources and allowing them to be spread here contributes to the misinformation surrounding mental health.\\n\\nIn terms of text posts, we **will not allow any posts that do not discuss fakers directly.** No posts outlining real symptoms or what it is really like to live with a disorder. There are places where these types of posts would be welcomed and valuable, however, they just do not fit here.\\n\\nThe only exception to this rule is awareness posts that directly relate to faking disorders. For example, statistics about fakers, studies about fakers, news stories about fakers, etc, would all be welcomed on this subreddit. You can use disorder-specific flairs or the \"discussion thread\" flair when making these types of posts. \\n\\nFrom now on, any posts that do not have to do with fakers will be removed for breaking rule #1. Stay on Topic.\\n\\n# Why are These Changes Happening?\\n\\nWe know that awareness posts are a hot topic on the subreddit. Some people want this subreddit to be educational. We hear you, but **we encourage you to seek credible information outside of Reddit** instead. Our mod team is not entirely made up of medical professionals. It is not our responsibility or our place to be the gatekeepers of medical information. At the end of the day, even professionals do not all agree on certain aspects of disorders like DID. Please do your own research outside of this subreddit and listen to professionals. There are many medical journals and studies that are available to the public if you are interested in learning in-depth information.\\n\\nWe are here to call out faking and misinformation, so of course, we do encourage people to discuss and correct misinformation. In the comments, you are still more than welcome to talk about real disorders and how they work. It is always preferred that you include a link to the credible source where you got your information, but this is not a hard rule. As always, no blogging or trauma dumping; personal experience is not a credible source.', 'I used to have a friend who faked disorders and also faked being bsfs with my deceased friend. This would’ve been about 4-5 years ago. However to this day I still hear about her faking mental disorders. \\n\\nI met her (I’ll call her Z) through a mutual back in middle school and we became acquaintances at the time. She would sit in the corner and act all depressed and when I asked my (ex)friend what was wrong she said “oh yeah Z has cancer so she’s in pain right now,” which I mean, middle schoolers are stupid. The fact she is still doing this current day is more ridiculous than anything. \\n\\nA year after the “cancer incident” we became close friends and had a pretty big friend group because we all shared a class and started hanging out during lunch together. Z was fine until I went on a trip to California to see my grandparents and suddenly she confessed she liked me. I didn’t know what to say at the time so I just said “okay that’s cool.” She warned me and said that she had DID (she called it something else) and said she had multiple alters that would come out at different points and make her act different. I thought nothing of it at the time and just thought it was weird. I quietly rejected her, though. \\nZ used to tell my friend that we were holding hands and kissing on the bus despite us never having ever been on a bus together and she lived farther than me and used to have her parents drive her to school. She also used to confess her love to everyone else in the friend group, and saying the exact thing she did to me— DID and all. She convinced one of my friends so bad that it severely fucked her up for the next few years. I still think that she has trauma from the event. \\n\\nShe blamed her bad behavior and bullying within the friend group on her alters and mental disorders. So once one of my friends couldn’t take it anymore she decided to drop Z as a friend. A while after this, she passed away unexpectedly on a Saturday. I saw her about 6 hours before she passed away to get school work done. \\nZ decided to capitalize on her passing and use it as a way to garner attention, saying that she “was her best friend and used to hang out all the time,” which I and many others knew that wasn’t the case. They didn’t really hang out much after middle school. Z used to make fun of her and verbally abuse her in middle school, sucked that I couldn’t do anything about it. \\n\\nZ also used my friend’s death as a way to write college essays to schools, one of my friends proofread her paper and said it was one of the most putrid things he’s ever read. Really sucks that she’s been trying to garner attention by not only faking mental illness but by also using my friend’s death for sympathy points. \\n\\nZ also began to fake autism 2-3 years after my friend passed away, flaunting it around my friends and many others saying she had high functioning autism. She was completely aware that I had an autistic brother. There was one time I was at the library and I discussed my brother’s autism and she scoffed, “not like you’d know anything about that,” which… she’s the one faking so I’m sure I don’t know much but go off. \\n\\nShe then started to fake ADHD, taking pills and all. Apparently Z used to get all jittery and distracted when taking them which is not supposed to happen on those specific medications. \\n\\nWhen those were not giving her attention and people saw through, they just left her for good reason. She began faking DID again up til a few months ago. Not sure where she is now but I know she’s just going back full circle. \\n\\nWe made amends a while ago, though I don’t think I’ll ever forgive her for pretending to be best friends with my deceased friend and disrespecting her memory. Genuinely the worst thing she’s ever done is that and I can’t forgive her for that. Because we as a friend group knew what she did to her yet she continued to use her memory as a way to garner attention and get into colleges.\\n\\nThis is pretty long. Very all over the place. I feel the need to say something now because this is something that affected a lot of people not just myself. I hope Z grows but knowing she did all these things doesn’t give me much hope she’s gonna change and be better.', 'Thoughts on faking I find it very fascinating on why do people fake disorders. I mean i get it that with the rise of social media and everyone wanting to be different and validated by strangers, you want attention, you want people to tell you that you are a special person who everyone should pay attention to and everyone should give you special privilege, just because you have it so hard. But it is interesting to see the mentality and the behavior of these people. \\n\\nIn general there are some very basic patterns in all of them:\\n\\n1) Must have some form of out of the ordinary appearance (dyed hair, piercings, haircut, makeup). Anything to seem different.\\n\\n2) Whatever disorder is trendy (if the disorder was trendy when you started but it isn\\'t now, make sure that you keep up the old disorder but somehow progress into a trendy one, or just start faking the new disorder as well, blame it on \"newly developed\", \"i feel safe to share\", etc.)\\n\\n3) \"My disorder has to be worse than yours\" - mentality. You cannot be unique if 5 others have the same issue as you, yours has to be worse than anyone else.\\n\\n4) \"i did the research\", thing is that people will eventually catch on and confront you, so if you just double down on \"research you did\" then you can just spew out BS as people at call them haters without going further into the subject. The more technical jargon you can throw in, the more believable you become right!!!.   \\n\\n5) Somehow the LGBTQ has to be involved in your claims, cause you know, you need all the ammo you can get if you want to double down on your claims. Somehow everyone is queer, has their pronouns ready in a heartbeat, pronouns for their alters and their sexuality. Bonus points for any ambiguous sexuality or pronouns so that you can seem even more unique and special. \"Guys it is hard as a non-human, ze/xe/zer, polymorphical lizard who suffers from OCD/DID/ADHD/ODD to find a partner\".\\n\\nWhile i find this somewhat annoying, yet entertaining to watch these people, I can\\'t help but think what happens when the camera goes down? Of course the act drops and they go on like a regular person, only assuming the lie again when they interact with other people. However, it must be such a sad existence, since in your real life you will never get that kind of validation and attention to you got used to. People in real life will never give you special treatment, no matter how much you yell \"special needs\", it might work once or twice, but people catch on and start to avoid you. As time passes by, your \"fame\" fades and keeping up the act is no longer interesting as you always have to one up yourself to stay relevant. Then what happens? You have no skills, no prospects and your time in the light will stay forever on the internet. No one wants to associate with you due to your previous behavior and you have not cultivated any relationships which will help you make a carrier or help you do something with your life. What will your options be then? Pick up the pieces and move somewhere else, hope that you can start fresh? Live in fear that perhaps someone will find out who you used to be and call you out? Problem is, people don\\'t look very kindly on this type of behavior. Making mistakes is normal, faking illnesses makes people doubt you and automatically associate you with a horrible person. Alternatively, become yet another person dependent on the system since you have missed your time to make something of yourself.', 'Just wanted to share that sometimes seeing a professional can actually create illness fakers, not cure them I just wanted to offer a potential alternate perspective for why some of these people may be misdiagnosing themselves, especially the ones who insist that they were already \"officially diagnosed\" even when their diagnoses clearly make no sense.  Sometimes patients can be misguided by a very unprofessional therapist, and unfortunately, that\\'s what happened to me. I had a therapist who tried to pin every label she could on me without actually going through the diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists can be much the same way, they have such a limited amount of time that they\\'ve become complacent with just assuming you have some garden variety problem without even glancing at your chart and then slap you with whatever prescription they\\'re being told to shill out for the time or wtfever. \\n\\nI\\'d been hit with OCD, OSDD/DID, ADHD, Bipolar II, dependent personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder (which can\\'t even be diagnosed in minors??), avoidant personality disorder, \\'almost schizophrenic yet obviously sane\\' (wtf does that mean???),  gender identity disorder (boy did that one royally fuck me up for a while!), etc etc. At one point my therapist got frustrated and said \"Ugh I just can\\'t figure you out!\" and sent me for a 3 day barrage of testing by a psychologist who clearly had some kind of agenda and convinced me I obviously had gender identity disorder and nothing else. Later a psychiatrist would declare that I also have OCD and ADHD and medicated me for both, and both of the meds just made me feel worse. I was so lost and desperate to understand myself and get my issues treated so I could just have a normal life, that I was compliant and really managed to convince myself (with their pressure, and my parent\\'s pressure since it took the heat off of them) that it was all true. I believed I was the opposite gender and had OCD and ADHD for YEARS until it lead me to an actual nervous breakdown because I was unknowingly living a complete lie. TikTok didn\\'t exist, but I did have a tumblr account where coincidentally I was surrounded by like-minded people who reinforced this in me for a while, and I proudly allowed these labels to become my identity. This isn\\'t a knock against anyone who is transgender btw, just my personal experience with bad doctors. But imagine if I had really gone through with taking hormones and permanently altering my body, which I nearly did... I would have likely ended up suicidal. \\n\\nDeep down I knew something wasn\\'t right, and it turned out, after all that wasted time, I just had really shitty doctors and once I finally changed to a new office that wasn\\'t completely irresponsible, my new therapist and I were able to figure out (over the course of YEARS of slowly sharing my whole life story and deconstructing all my defense mechanisms with her) that I actually had none of those disorders, and am in fact just on the autism spectrum with some PTSD-like symptoms due to childhood neglect and emotional abuse, as well as substance abuse issues due to some of the meds I\\'d been misprescribed. This made SO MUCH MORE SENSE and has vastly improved my mental health and the treatment I\\'m receiving, and I\\'m doing better than ever. My previous therapist never even discussed what was going on at home with me, and I was a minor at the time!\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m just offering a perspective on how sometimes, seeing a professional can actually CREATE illness fakers, not cure them... I wonder how many of the people featured here are in a similar situation?

I saw Adults and teens older than me talking about this mental illness and how anyone could have it just because they own a fidget toy. I was convinced that I have adhd. Me getting distracted easily, getting tired or suddenly very energetic was because of my adhd, getting bad marks was because of my adhd, literally everything I did was because of adhd. \\nCuz it all made sense, it gave me an advantage, I could now blame something other than me for all the bad habits I had, and not even be the bad guy for it. \\nI convinced my mother to take me to a doctor for diagnosis, and I did get diagnosed with adhd but also other mental illnesses that was caused by external factors, but obviously I only paid attention to my adhd. I did not care about getting better. I did not care about my mental health. No I only cared about the attention I got and being able to do anything without consequences. \\nBut then TikTok got banned in my country, I lost my main supporters, I started feeling lonely and unvalid.\\nMy mother had had enough, she had a big conversation with me and it made me realise how toxic my life had been the previous year, but I still kept blaming everything on my adhd only now I was trying to get better. But no matter how hard I tried it was only getting worse. my health was deteriorating and I was getting worse and worse marks in my exams.\\n6 months ago my parents took me to get a blood test done and turns out I actually have a life threatening auto immune disorder and had I not gone to the doctors then the illness could have very well gotten to the point of no return which could have even lead to death.the symptoms of this illness are very similar to the symptoms of adhd. These tiktokers made me so convinced that I have adhd that I didn’t even try to find other reasons for my health conditions.\\n\\nI truly hate these people for ruining almost 4 years of my life. I lost my chance at getting merit in my 10th grade which I know I could have gotten if I  had not been basically manipulated into not getting any help and thinking that my problems will never get solved and my bad habits will never go away since I have adhd and that I just have to accept it and that it will all work out once I do. \\nI have wasted my parents money, made my mother feel bad and guilty every time I shouted at her for no reason and justifying it with me having adhd. I lost the time I could have spent with my sister instead of calling her the worst sister ever just because she tried to find other reasons to my problems other than adhd. \\n\\nSorry if this felt like I was trauma dumping but truly these people on TikTok especially the adults need to understand how terribly misleading and dangerous their posts can be to  kids and even naive adults.', 'What is this \"blind react\" thing I keep seeing? I just found out about this sub, and as someone with lifelong mental health issues, it\\'s pretty sad. But what is this, \"They say you\\'ll blind react if you have XYZ?\" Like what does \"blind react\" mean? I have way too many diagnoses, and I\\'ve even taken a higher level psychology course that dealt solely with mental illness, but I never came across that term before. What even is it? Is it a real thing at all? And if so, what disorders is it associated with?\\n\\nI even saw one that said, \"You\\'ll blind react if you have ADHD\". I\\'ve done a shit-ton of reading on ADHD, and involuntarily reacting to music is definitely not something I\\'ve remotely heard of as a symptom.\\n\\nCan anyone shed some light on what they\\'re referring to?', 'About Eizawolfe and Stigma If you\\'re here on this subreddit from her recent TikTok, I want you to hear me out. Before anything else, I want to make perfectly clear I do not wish any harm on this young lady and I do not know whether or not she actually has autism. No one in this subreddit knows for certain because none of us have properly assessed her in the ways only a doctor can. I will say, however, that the information she has given to the public does not make sense and has therefore caused suspicion that she is not telling the truth. I will be talking about why this suspicion came about, but before getting into that, I want to talk about why what she is doing is harmful not only to her but also to other people regardless of whether or not she actually has autism.\\n\\nThe majority of the people on this subreddit have been diagnosed with disorders, disabilities, and/or mental illnesses. We have experienced first-hand the consequences of other people self-diagnosing and seeking attention. There are people who have been bullied, assaulted, refused treatment, refused medication, and yes, there are people who have died because of this problem. What self-diagnosers and attention-seekers do is add to the stigma associated with disorders and mental illness. Some of you might be thinking I\\'m blowing this way out of proportion, but those of you who have been properly diagnosed will understand I am not, and I\\'d greatly appreciate you telling your story in the comments and/or providing references you may have to further educate these people who do not understand. \\n\\nHere\\'s one reference on combatting the stigma of mental illness: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477\\n\\nNotice how receiving treatment is one of the ways to combat the stigma. However, you cannot receive treatment if you have not been diagnosed by someone that\\'s QUALIFIED to make a diagnosis. YOU are not qualified to diagnose yourself. Even if you were a doctor, you could not diagnose yourself. Even if you have a family member who is a doctor, they cannot diagnose you. This is because of ethics, which are purposefully put in place to protect patients. \\n\\nThere is a reason why doctors have to go through such rigorous schooling. There is a reason why they need to be updated on research. There is a reason why many of them conduct research themselves. This is so they can learn to properly DIAGNOSE and TREAT patients. \\n\\nAre there bad doctors out there? Yep. Can doctors make mistakes? Yep. Can doctors be unsure of what to do? Yep. Does one type of doctor not know everything? Yep. \\n\\nThis is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.\\n\\n(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you\\'d think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it\\'s not.)\\n\\nNow that I\\'m done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I\\'m going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you\\'re reading this, perhaps you\\'d be willing to clear a few things up. \\n\\n(I\\'m going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)\\n\\n1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I\\'m not saying you can\\'t look up your symptoms and go, \"Hey maybe I\\'ve got this!\" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, \"But my therapist thinks I\\'m autistic and other doctors too!\" Doesn\\'t matter, they\\'re apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That\\'s why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. \\n\\n2. It\\'s entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn\\'t real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn\\'t have. What doesn\\'t make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. \\n\\n3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver\\'s test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. \\n\\n4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you\\'re paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I\\'m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn\\'t make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I\\'m likely to get bombarded with, \"but her health insurance doesn\\'t cover anyone else!!!!\" Definitely possible, but it\\'d be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that\\'s willing to diagnose you for that much money. \\n\\n5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you\\'re sitting in front of what you said was \"some random woman sleeping behind you.\" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there\\'s a whole lot of you going outside so... ???\\n\\nI can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I\\'ll save you some time. Yes, it\\'s possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn\\'t talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn\\'t make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that\\'d clear things up. It\\'s public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. \\n\\nNote: Don\\'t go harass her on Instagram. \\n\\nA lot of things to make this long post even longer: \\nEizawolfe, you took people\\'s money for a diagnosis, I hope that\\'s actually what you\\'re using it for. I also hope you squash everyone\\'s suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you\\'re autistic, it\\'s not right to be speaking like you\\'re a part of a mistreated group of people when you don\\'t truly know if you\\'re a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we\\'re all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can\\'t speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren\\'t lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol \\n\\nIf anyone\\'s wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I\\'ve been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. \\n\\nAnd if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it\\'s 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don\\'t be shy. :\\') \\n\\nStay strong guys.', 'My Ex Faked ADHD and got a half-arsed \\'diagnosis\\' for it... 😭 So, as the title says, my ex-partner faked ADHD as a way to get easier marking on exams and a \\'diagnosis\\' as he called it. \\n\\nI\\'m just going to set the scene a little here, my partner (at the time FTM 14y/o) he\\'s older now, I\\'m 16 has always been obsessed with his trauma stories... He would call me and his friend late at night \\'drunk\\' (we all know that\\'s not what happened), when we\\'d ask him what he\\'d had to drink, or what he\\'d done, he\\'d always avoid the question and interrupt on text with keyboard spam like \"ommgg i hagd sucjh aj bhdaf cdayy todgayy\", which always made us cringe, but we\\'d let it slide, cause, who cares right?\\n\\nWell, a few months back, he texted me one afternoon with \"Omg!! I met with \\\\[school counsellor\\\\] and she diagnosed me with ADHD!!!! Finally!\", something along those lines... Now, I\\'m not sure how diagnoses work in other countries, but school counsellors here are not even close to qualified enough to diagnose mental health conditions, only to help kids through them. \\n\\nSo, I was curious as to *how* he was diagnosed, so I asked \"when did you start thinking you had ADHD? I\\'ve never seen you exhibit symptoms lol\", and you would\\'ve thought I had\\'ve like murdered his whole family, he got so offended like \"you wouldn\\'t understand\" and \"you ableist pr\\\\*ck\". \\n\\nWell, that was a short-lived relationship, and I\\'m glad I\\'m out of it - one funny thing is, now he\\'s going to the \\'special exam room\\' for kids with attention deficit disorders; he is not medicated, he does not have a diagnosis (other than his self-diagnosis), nor is he seeing someone for it.

Im an especially socially anxious person, and it keeps me up at night thinking about not only how horrid it was of me to do that but how much my friends might be disappointed in me.\\n\\nAs of now i am especially fearful of if, because of my ill informed decision to fake DID for that week or so, they may think im exaggerating when i say i have other conditions. Sort of like, what if its a boy who cried wolf situation?\\n\\nAt 12 when i had faked this disorder, i had a conversation with my mum about a couple weeks or so after i startedthat of course DID isn’t something that id have and its much more serious. Around then i realised the gravity of what i was doing and i stopped then and there, but at the time i felt really guilty about it - still do - and i lied to my friends that it was mistaken and “after a talk with a psychologist” (which i didn’t have at the time) it turns out it was just drastic mood swings. I was scared at the time to admit that i faked it, because i realised that it was an absolutely awful thing to do and it made me feel sick to my stomach!\\n\\nIts been a long time since then and i really do want to address this to my friends.

There can never just be one and they do these source/canon calls like people do with kin. It\\'s a game to them\\n\\nI\\'m not doubting that these kids have been through things. And there\\'s always a chance of being wrong which is healthy to acknowledge. Growing up in a pandemic, so many political issues, plus whatever personal trauma may cause these behaviors. But it does take repeated, SEVERE early childhood trauma to develop DID/OSDD to an extent most will never experience, even some badly abused kids. A DSMP introject isn\\'t impossible per se but it\\'s not very likely or something that makes sense to happen at this frequency or even close to it. A child likely wouldn\\'t need to develop the whole DSMP cast to survive\\n\\nThe positivity post is wholesome but it does take so much to develop dissociative disorders. Though pwDID do undermine their own trauma oftentimes, a post like that won\\'t likely apply to them unless their trauma came from elsewhere (not parents/family)\\n\\nBut for such a horrendous disorder they treat these alleged introjects like novelties, all acting in character. It\\'s all like one big party trick and not much different from kin to them. This is extremely rare with other fandoms, maybe sometimes BNHA and Homestuck get treated similarly but DSMP is on another level. And if you ever met an introject of any of these sources, they probably wouldn\\'t tell you\\n\\nAnd \"comfort/hyperfixation/ASD\" is not a reason for a bunch of characters to appear with their wacky hijinks and funny banter. Most introjects are of real people, abusers. They can take on persecutory roles, reenacting some of the worst trauma of your life- as opposed to reenacting your favorite Owl House scenes\\n\\nAlters may do horrible things to their bodies and think they are evil, they may sabotage recovery, they may be SEVERELY brainwashed to always return to their abuser(s). They can destroy friendships, relationships, education, and life opportunities. Over 70% of pwDID actively attempt suicide at some point. There are many comorbidities both physical and mental so these people often suffer from many other things they\\'re often not self dxing but have no choice other than to get help/dxed due to how debilitating symptoms are\\n\\nI want the people doing things like this to know all this because I truly mean them no harm but this is dangerous and harms so many people. People who think they\\'re freaks and monsters and crazy as they watch these 15 year olds proudly and openly claim to have dozens of DSMP alters. Read the DSM-V section for DID titled \"Factitious disorder and malingering\" because the consistencies are uncanny', 'Just wanted to share that sometimes seeing a professional can actually create illness fakers, not cure them I just wanted to offer a potential alternate perspective for why some of these people may be misdiagnosing themselves, especially the ones who insist that they were already \"officially diagnosed\" even when their diagnoses clearly make no sense.  Sometimes patients can be misguided by a very unprofessional therapist, and unfortunately, that\\'s what happened to me. I had a therapist who tried to pin every label she could on me without actually going through the diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists can be much the same way, they have such a limited amount of time that they\\'ve become complacent with just assuming you have some garden variety problem without even glancing at your chart and then slap you with whatever prescription they\\'re being told to shill out for the time or wtfever. \\n\\nI\\'d been hit with OCD, OSDD/DID, ADHD, Bipolar II, dependent personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder (which can\\'t even be diagnosed in minors??), avoidant personality disorder, \\'almost schizophrenic yet obviously sane\\' (wtf does that mean???),  gender identity disorder (boy did that one royally fuck me up for a while!), etc etc. At one point my therapist got frustrated and said \"Ugh I just can\\'t figure you out!\" and sent me for a 3 day barrage of testing by a psychologist who clearly had some kind of agenda and convinced me I obviously had gender identity disorder and nothing else. Later a psychiatrist would declare that I also have OCD and ADHD and medicated me for both, and both of the meds just made me feel worse. I was so lost and desperate to understand myself and get my issues treated so I could just have a normal life, that I was compliant and really managed to convince myself (with their pressure, and my parent\\'s pressure since it took the heat off of them) that it was all true. I believed I was the opposite gender and had OCD and ADHD for YEARS until it lead me to an actual nervous breakdown because I was unknowingly living a complete lie. TikTok didn\\'t exist, but I did have a tumblr account where coincidentally I was surrounded by like-minded people who reinforced this in me for a while, and I proudly allowed these labels to become my identity. This isn\\'t a knock against anyone who is transgender btw, just my personal experience with bad doctors. But imagine if I had really gone through with taking hormones and permanently altering my body, which I nearly did... I would have likely ended up suicidal. \\n\\nDeep down I knew something wasn\\'t right, and it turned out, after all that wasted time, I just had really shitty doctors and once I finally changed to a new office that wasn\\'t completely irresponsible, my new therapist and I were able to figure out (over the course of YEARS of slowly sharing my whole life story and deconstructing all my defense mechanisms with her) that I actually had none of those disorders, and am in fact just on the autism spectrum with some PTSD-like symptoms due to childhood neglect and emotional abuse, as well as substance abuse issues due to some of the meds I\\'d been misprescribed. This made SO MUCH MORE SENSE and has vastly improved my mental health and the treatment I\\'m receiving, and I\\'m doing better than ever. My previous therapist never even discussed what was going on at home with me, and I was a minor at the time!\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m just offering a perspective on how sometimes, seeing a professional can actually CREATE illness fakers, not cure them... I wonder how many of the people featured here are in a similar situation? Sorry for rambling, I haven\\'t even had my coffee yet...', nan, nan, \"Rant about a faker in my school's neurodiversity society TL;DR Faker keeps showing up to my school's neurodiversity society and expects us to coddle her and agree that she struggles so much more than us.\\n\\nMy school has an invite-only (diagnosis = invite) neurodiversity society with around 8 regular members that meet each week to talk about coping strategies for learning disabilities, what we're up to and stuff like that. The invites are managed by staff but it's student-run. For the past few weeks, a faker (with ASD, ADHD, OCD, anxiety and dyslexia - all self-diagnosed) has been showing up unprompted and derailing any chance of actual conversation. She harassed my friend until he told her where we met and when we suggested she leave (very politely considering), she said we were all classist and homophobic, and she wasn't going to move. Afterwards, she complained to my friend that we didn't understand how hard she has it and that we didn't ask any questions - was she expecting to show up and recount her life story?\\n\\nEven though we've gotten teachers to speak to her several times, she keeps showing up. We changed the meeting place but she complained to the head of student support that by excluding her we were breaking the law (by discriminating against her disability...). For the record, she isn't looking for a diagnosis, because she thinks doctors are misinformed and she understands more about mental illnesses than they do. \\n\\nIn the meetings, she constantly complains about how hard her disorders make her life and whenever someone suggests a management strategy she always shoots them down with 'Oh I've already tried that, but my \\\\[insert disorder here\\\\] is *much* worse than yours.' She accused me of cheating on exams for having access arrangements because she doesn't have them and she suffers so much more than me. I walked out and she tried to have me banned from the group because it really upset her when I didn't sit there and let her insult me. Ugh. Whenever anyone else speaks, she either interrupts to talk about herself or acts as bored as possible which means others are way less likely to contribute. The society is for ages 11-18 and it's really disheartening to see this 17-year-old take away a space 12-year-olds use to open up about their experiences and get advice...\\n\\nAnother thing - when she found out I was on medication she's been hounding me about giving her my prescription and just saying I lost it which- I don't have the words for how much it annoys me. Rant over.\", 'When people fake ADHD/Autism/Mood disorders/Psychotic disorders, it makes actually diagnosed folks feel like they are faking, too. (Rant) I\\'m diagnosed with ADHD, and have been ever since 2nd grade. SZA, and Generalized Anxiety. These are real diagnoses, not something to be \\'proud\\' of or try to make it seem \\'cute\\' on the internet for attention. With how people on tiktok/instagram portray our conditions, it makes me feel like how I cope is invalid/fake. \\n\\nSpecifically the sensory necklaces/ fidget tools. I love these, because as someone that sensation seeks often, especially with my mouth and with textured objects. They help to such a degree that has been a blessing. I have stims too, rolling my wrists around, pulling on my knuckles and tapping my fingertips together, stroking my own hair. I don\\'t talk about this stim but when I get extremely frustrated with a task, I do flap my hands/shake them aggressively, this feels like a release of anger/physical tension when it does happen. These stims are often very involuntary. I don\\'t even realize it.  \\n\\nThe way the ADHD/Autistic stims are faked on tiktok is often with the \\'happy stim\\' you\\'ll see that they will flail their arms around along with other actions that are not typical or even seen with real diagnosed individuals. Ive had a lot of friends with ADHD/Autism (coming from special education schools ive been in) and we do not display in that manner. Our \\'happy\\' stims are often more along the lines of head bopping, and rocking side to side. Not acting unhinged like the imposters on tiktok. \\n\\nWhen I see people acting like this on tiktok, it makes me think \"what if how I stim is fake, too? am I invalid?\" it\\'s awful. People like us have gotten a bad name due to these imposters. I\\'ve seen some comments on here (this subreddit) about the people on tiktok with the necklaces and fidgets \"but people that are actually diagnosed do not use those\" some of us do, and like you know, to each their own.  \\n\\nWell that is the end of this rant, if you read the whole thing, thank you!

But basically, I recently got put in a mental hospital where I share some kind of small campus with other old teenage/young adult. There’s this one person who claim to be a system with like 100+ alters, many of them are fictives. most Of the alters’s sources are anime or genshin impact. And they are 19.

And right now they say that they are a anime character and they believe that they are Sebastian from black butler and some characters from danganropa and that if anyone says “wow I don’t think that’s how it works” they get defensive and call them ableist. They have shown me pictures of anime characters and claiming that it’s them brings around a copy of black butler and will point out pictures and say that “they look so cute” it’s honestly really cringey. My boyfriend doesn’t believe them at all and of course they bring it up to me complaining and telling me to break up with him because he’s a terrible person. I knew exactly what he texted their friend and I have no problem with it but I really don’t know if their faking this because as I do have depersonalization and DID I honestly can’t tell because mine has never been like this and was hoping for some insight also sorry if my grammar or spelling is wrong English isn’t my first language.', 'Some possibly-overlooked points I know that there’s already tons of discussion threads about self-diagnosis already, but I want to talk about a few points I think get inadequate attention:\\n\\n“Diagnosis” implies *certainty*; doctors only make a diagnosis when they are *reasonably* *certain* of the situation. But if you’re evaluating yourself, you cannot ever be *reasonably* certain, as self-bias is unavoidable (professionals can’t even treat their friends and family because that’d be a conflict of interest). You can say you *suspect* you have something because “suspect” means you are open to the opinion of the professionals.\\n\\nWhen it comes to psychology and neurology, self-diagnosis is *never* okay. Not even for the “simpler” diagnoses like depression or anxiety. Simple physical ailments can be okay to self-diagnose as the evidence is more tangible, but psychology can be so intangible and convoluted that you can very easily be steered wrong. Think about it; how can you tell *for* *sure* if what you have is clinical depression or a bout of sadness? An anxiety disorder or an abnormal amount of stress? AVPD or apprehension towards social situations? You have no baseline to compare your experience to! \\n“But what about DSM-5 criteria?” You can stare at the criteria all you want—you’ll never be able to overcome self-bias. It’s disturbingly easy to see yourself in the criteria. You’d need to have someone else who can view your situation though an objective lens and analyze it with the DSM-5. The DSM is helpful and informative, but it omits a lot of the nuance around the disorders that professionals can keep in mind.\\n\\nIf you defend self-diagnosis because you believe that professionals are misguided and cold-hearted, you should stop relying on the DSM-5 to evaluate yourself. Because guess who’s responsible for it? And while we’re at it, guess who’s responsible for all the research on the very same disorders you believe you have?\\n\\nAnother defense of self-diagnosis is that you know your mind better than the professionals. And that’s half-true; you know your personality and habits better than anyone, and that’s why therapy sessions are spent asking and answering questions like in an interview. Professionals know much more about how minds work *in* *general*. You might know what your personality and habits are, but professionals know more about what might be happening behind the scenes that explains them.\\n\\nThe most common grievance people voice to back self-diagnosis is that professional intervention is expensive. One option being inaccessible doesn’t automatically make the other option okay.\\n\\nHow self-diagnosis and psychology misinformation harms actual sufferers gets lots of attention, but I think we overlook how it harms disorder fakers themselves. Self-diagnosing can put them in boy-who-cried-wolf situations, meaning that when real problems crop up, they may not be taken seriously. No matter how the internet can make it look, self-diagnosis is still unpopular in the grand scheme of things, especially among older adults and professionals. In general, professionals have lost patience and empathy towards their patients/clients because of all this, which affects everybody, not just actual sufferers. \\n\\n**A few extra things:**\\n\\n“Disabled” is not an ableist slur. I’m Deaf (which, of course, means I’m disabled), and I think it’s a perfectly fitting descriptor of people with **disabilities**, which include psychological disorders. (And if you think “disorder” is ableist, take a good look at the disorders you might claim to have: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity **Disorder**, Autism Spectrum **Disorder**, Obsessive Compulsive **Disorder**, Dissociative Identity **Disorder**, and so on.) Disabilities are called so because they make it harder to get by in life in some way—this is the common denominator of **all** disabilities. If your supposed disorder does not get in the way of life, it’s very unlikely you have a disorder. \\nThis is why it irks me to see people describing their “disorders” or other “disabilities” like they’re superpowers. There can be advantages, but they’re outweighed by the disadvantages. Also, if you say your disorder isn’t a disability, why do you consider it ableist for others to speak out against you?\\n\\nYour fyp on TikTok isn’t showing videos relating to whatever disorder you think you have because you have it; it’s simply the algorithm showing you videos on topics you’ve shown interest in. And no, being interested in it doesn’t mean you have it. If that were true, professionals would be the ones with all those disorders.\\n\\nDisorder fakers and otherwise misinformed people will push the notion that professionals are cold-hearted and careless. A few here and there can be, but the vast majority of them became professionals in the first place because of a desire to learn about psychology and help people.', 'faking illness isn\\'t always a sign of mental illness in itself This whole \"a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they\\'re faking\" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they\\'re doing and still want to feel validated for it. \\nLet me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who\\'s probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. \\nOf course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. \\n\\nSee, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. \\nBut while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. \\n\\nIt first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don\\'t need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it\\'s easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing \"depressed\" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today\\'s teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren\\'t. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. \\n\\nThen we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I\\'m not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that\\'s as far as my memory goes and I\\'d appreciate elaboration. \\n\\nNow, it\\'s important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it\\'s not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I\\'m sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as \"damaged\". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. \\n\\nToday, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It\\'s actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you\\'re born with it, it\\'s not developed from trauma... \\nBut anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn\\'t identify as that) you talk to chances are she\\'s gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it\\'s actually so wide spread that it\\'s unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I\\'ve tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It\\'s incredibly depressing, and it\\'s a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word \\'depressing\\' just now, it\\'s no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you\\'d be looked down on it for because you don\\'t have a mental illness that implies that you\\'ve went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don\\'t even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that\\'s developed from lots of trauma and it\\'s kind of just assumed that you\\'re living a \"hellish life\".\\n\\nNow back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they\\'re in. It\\'s just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. \\nYou\\'re not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that\\'s causing you to be an attention seeker. You\\'re faking because it\\'s simply what everyone around you is doing, it\\'s what\\'s deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it\\'s what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. \\nThat does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren\\'t the reason they\\'re faking. \\nAnd that\\'s honestly not even those teens\\' faults. I\\'m sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it\\'s important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. \\n\\nThese people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you\\'ve been struggling with for years. But here\\'s the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;\\nBeing medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you\\'re going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there\\'s actually very few mental illness that cannot be \"fixed\". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. \\nBut all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a \"thropy\" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it\\'s not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what\\'s the point in knowing that you\\'re a DID system if you\\'re not going to take the time to become apart of those \"singlet\" people that you love insulting so much? \\n\\nSelf diagnosis is invalid.

Before anything else, I want to make perfectly clear I do not wish any harm on this young lady and I do not know whether or not she actually has autism. No one in this subreddit knows for certain because none of us have properly assessed her in the ways only a doctor can. I will say, however, that the information she has given to the public does not make sense and has therefore caused suspicion that she is not telling the truth. I will be talking about why this suspicion came about, but before getting into that, I want to talk about why what she is doing is harmful not only to her but also to other people regardless of whether or not she actually has autism.\\n\\nThe majority of the people on this subreddit have been diagnosed with disorders, disabilities, and/or mental illnesses. We have experienced first-hand the consequences of other people self-diagnosing and seeking attention. There are people who have been bullied, assaulted, refused treatment, refused medication, and yes, there are people who have died because of this problem. What self-diagnosers and attention-seekers do is add to the stigma associated with disorders and mental illness.

Yep. \\n\\nThis is why there are multiple doctors, specialists, referrals, and a sweet little thing called a second opinion.\\n\\n(I can feel some of you rolling your eyes at some of this because you\\'d think some of this stuff would be obvious but apparently it\\'s not.)\\n\\nNow that I\\'m done covering a few things in the most basic way I can think of, I\\'m going to get into what eizawolfe has to do with this, and since some of you probably forgot I will say again: I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE HAS AUTISM OR NOT. I am merely explaining why people are suspicious this is being faked. Eizawolfe, if you\\'re reading this, perhaps you\\'d be willing to clear a few things up. \\n\\n(I\\'m going to put this in a list to try and make it more organized)\\n\\n1. People who properly understand mental illness, disorders, or even basic psychology know that self-diagnosis is NOT OKAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I\\'m not saying you can\\'t look up your symptoms and go, \"Hey maybe I\\'ve got this!\" But to take this as a fact and state you have autism without a diagnosis is the equivalent of someone having a headache, googling it, and then telling everybody they have cancer. You might be thinking, \"But my therapist thinks I\\'m autistic and other doctors too!\" Doesn\\'t matter, they\\'re apparently not qualified to make a diagnosis. That\\'s why you were likely referred to a psychiatrist who is qualified to diagnose you. \\n\\n2. It\\'s entirely possible your psychiatrist is a fucking idiot. Hell, a psychology professor at my college told my friend depression isn\\'t real. There are a lot of stupid people out there with jobs they shouldn\\'t have. What doesn\\'t make sense, however, is why none of the doctorS (Not one. Plural. Your words not mine.) or your therapist can refer you to someone else who can diagnose you. It also makes no sense for you or your therapist not to report this psychiatrist. \\n\\n3. If you/your parents are able to afford therapy and multiple doctors, either via insurance or other means, why did you have to create a go fund me to find someone to diagnose you? You also mentioned a therapy dog as well as being able to drive. How are you going to afford a therapy dog, all of its care, a car, car insurance, gas, a driver\\'s test, and possibly someone to teach you how to drive? All those doctors and therapist and everything I just listed cost WAY MORE than the diagnosis you cannot afford. Please explain. \\n\\n4. Speaking of diagnosis, who is it you\\'re paying to diagnose you? Your wording was very strange and made it seem like you were paying someone to say you have autism without properly diagnosing you. I\\'m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you were being unclear, but adding onto point 3, it still doesn\\'t make sense why you have to pay someone if you either have health insurance or enough money for all those other doctor visits. This is where I\\'m likely to get bombarded with, \"but her health insurance doesn\\'t cover anyone else!!!!\" Definitely possible, but it\\'d be a hell of a coincidence and very odd since you found some random that\\'s willing to diagnose you for that much money. \\n\\n5. You mentioned looking forward to being able to go outside. According to Instagram, there are pictures of you at the beach, playing different instruments in front of people, even one where you\\'re sitting in front of what you said was \"some random woman sleeping behind you.\" There are also pictures of photographs you took outside of buildings and flowers, you went on some ride in Hawaii, had something to do with a spelling bee (not sure if participating or in charge of beind the scenes stuff). ANYWAYS, there\\'s a whole lot of you going outside so... ???\\n\\nI can already picture how people are going to yell at me or others about this so I\\'ll save you some time. Yes, it\\'s possible for neurodivergent people to go outside, have hobbies, participate in extracurricular activities, go on vacation, take pretty pictures of themselves, etc. But a point was made in her TikTok of how she longed to go outside (no she wasn\\'t talking about corona virus) so the fact there are THIS MANY pictures of her outside from the past two years when she seemed so in despair about it doesn\\'t make any sense to me. I might get called a creepy stalker for looking up her Instagram but she has quite a few TikTok followers so I thought maybe she had more social media where there could be info that\\'d clear things up. It\\'s public (duh) but the account seems to be more... Personal, I suppose. \\n\\nNote: Don\\'t go harass her on Instagram. \\n\\nA lot of things to make this long post even longer: \\nEizawolfe, you took people\\'s money for a diagnosis, I hope that\\'s actually what you\\'re using it for. I also hope you squash everyone\\'s suspicions and show proof of all of this. It might upset you and others for me to mention you needing proof, but you put all of this information on the internet for anyone to go see and then you took it further and started a go fund me. At the very least, the people who generously donated to you deserve to know you used the money you said you would. Regardless of whether or not you\\'re autistic, it\\'s not right to be speaking like you\\'re a part of a mistreated group of people when you don\\'t truly know if you\\'re a part of them. If you get a diagnosis from a qualified professional, then go ahead and talk about your journey, your struggles, and help end the stigma we\\'re all trying to fight against in this subreddit. I can\\'t speak for everyone, but I truly hope you aren\\'t lying and this was a misunderstanding. Hopefully you even read this post to begin with lol \\n\\nIf anyone\\'s wondering, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about ten years ago, and I\\'ve been on medication ever since. I recently got my BA in psychology, so I believe I at least know some shit about this kind of stuff. \\n\\nAnd if anyone has more info on this situation or I messed something up in the post (I likely did it\\'s 2 am why am I awake) or anyone would like to share their experiences... Don\\'t be shy. :\\') \\n\\nStay strong guys.', nan, 'Faking trauma & severe abuse I hope this is allowed, it’s a topic that’s been on my mind for weeks and I’d just like to hear opinions or even facts about current happenings.\\n\\nSo over the past several months I’ve noticed kind of an influx of people talking about surviving cults, and escaping from severe ritual abuse. I’ve seen more videos discussing the topic, and of course the popular YouTube interview with a survivor of ritual abuse. I don’t want to start saying people are all faking and making things up, it just really makes me wonder how many people would be willing to lie about things like that, and how many of them ARE lying about it currently.\\n\\nIt’s really difficult without actual proof to just accuse people of lying about things like that, trauma -especially that’s so horrific- isn’t something that can easily be judged without a doctor and therapist working with the person closely. A couple of things kind of stand out to me about some of these people, and I hope I don’t sound mean when I say these, again I don’t want to outright accuse people for no reason.\\n\\nSeveral of the videos I’ve seen of people coming out about their abuse have been on tiktok, which is a red flag in general for mental health issues, but it weirds me out more the way it’s talked about. The person I just watched for example was being very theatrical about it, claiming “well the villain always has an origin story” and talking in a way that a lot of people who experienced those things do not talk. Sometimes it almost feels like bragging about how horrific it was sometimes.\\n\\nAm I just noticing a pattern that’s not there? Could it just be that now is a safer time for these people to come forward? I also worry that, like the DID video said youtuber made, this could also become something “popular” or “trendy”.\\n\\nThank you guys and I hope this made sense.', nan, 'The DSMP community absolutely desecrating the progress and stigma reduction for DID/OSDD 🥴 For the last few years more and more of these DSMP alters/systems have been popping up and making a mockery of DID/OSDD. There can never just be one and they do these source/canon calls like people do with kin. It\\'s a game to them\\n\\nI\\'m not doubting that these kids have been through things. And there\\'s always a chance of being wrong which is healthy to acknowledge. Growing up in a pandemic, so many political issues, plus whatever personal trauma may cause these behaviors. But it does take repeated, SEVERE early childhood trauma to develop DID/OSDD to an extent most will never experience, even some badly abused kids. A DSMP introject isn\\'t impossible per se but it\\'s not very likely or something that makes sense to happen at this frequency or even close to it. A child likely wouldn\\'t need to develop the whole DSMP cast to survive\\n\\nThe positivity post is wholesome but it does take so much to develop dissociative disorders. Though pwDID do undermine their own trauma oftentimes, a post like that won\\'t likely apply to them unless their trauma came from elsewhere (not parents/family)\\n\\nBut for such a horrendous disorder they treat these alleged introjects like novelties, all acting in character. It\\'s all like one big party trick and not much different from kin to them. This is extremely rare with other fandoms, maybe sometimes BNHA and Homestuck get treated similarly but DSMP is on another level. And if you ever met an introject of any of these sources, they probably wouldn\\'t tell you\\n\\nAnd \"comfort/hyperfixation/ASD\" is not a reason for a bunch of characters to appear with their wacky hijinks and funny banter. Most introjects are of real people, abusers. They can take on persecutory roles, reenacting some of the worst trauma of your life- as opposed to reenacting your favorite Owl House scenes\\n\\nAlters may do horrible things to their bodies and think they are evil, they may sabotage recovery, they may be SEVERELY brainwashed to always return to their abuser(s). They can destroy friendships, relationships, education, and life opportunities. Over 70% of pwDID actively attempt suicide at some point. There are many comorbidities both physical and mental so these people often suffer from many other things they\\'re often not self dxing but have no choice other than to get help/dxed due to how debilitating symptoms are\\n\\nI want the people doing things like this to know all this because I truly mean them no harm but this is dangerous and harms so many people. People who think they\\'re freaks and monsters and crazy as they watch these 15 year olds proudly and openly claim to have dozens of DSMP alters. Read the DSM-V section for DID titled \"Factitious disorder and malingering\" because the consistencies are uncanny', 'Just say you like roleplaying Like why can’t they just roleplay or say they like it because that’s what they’re doing. I did online fantasy role playing when I was around the general age group of most of these people, I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nEdit to add since I fell down a hole last night: What the fuck is up with fictives. This brings me back to role playing; like just roleplay them. Fictives are so fucking stupid and it’s hard to believe they’re even remotely a real thing. What do fakers do when someone has the same fictives as them and are friends? Like battle out which one is the REAL fictive\\n\\nEdit 2: once again fell down a deeper hole into plural. I ended up on pluralityresource.org and the glossary… mind numbing. \\n\\n“Dissociative Identity Disorder – The ‘official’ diagnosis for plurality. This applies to some plurals but not all. It is a state in which a person’s mind ‘dissociates’ and becomes several different minds. Sometimes this is caused by trauma, sometimes not. Psychology believes this is the only cause for plurality, but most plurals beg to differ. Symptoms include extreme memory loss and losing time. Formerly called Multiple Personality Disorder. You can find an official definition in the DSM-IV. [Multiple Personality Disorder]”\\n\\nThis specific one is wild because “most plurals beg to differ” regarding needing trauma to have DID- like that TRULY is just roleplaying and fanfiction. No doubt people can have DID, but plurality is truly just roleplaying. Also, like, why would you take the opinions of self-proclaimed “plurals” to heart over actual science? Like of course they’re gonna say that bc they’re having fun and want to do this. I’m losing my mind', 'Have these kids really done no research about DID? I’m not a medical professional. take anything i say with a grain of salt. \\n\\nFirst of all, they all claim to know exactly who their alters are with some depth at about 14-20. This is a major sign that they are faking. Personality states do not become distinct or fully formed until much later in life, if at all. Therapy usually slows down the process of this if the person struggling with it realises they might have something wrong with them and seeks help. Because of the amnesia barriers, they still wouldn’t know who the alters are and wouldn’t be able to communicate with them. So, they wouldn’t know their gender identity or pronouns or mental illness or whatnot. (Note: There can be some level of communication between alters, but that is also really rare because of the amnesia).\\n\\nAnother thing these fakers do is claim each alter has different mental illnesses or conditions. Again, this is a red flag. Although not much research has gone into this disorder because of how incredibly fucking rare it is, the research that has been done shows that a personality state could have a different mental illness than what the “body” has, but not neurological conditions. The brain is incredibly unique, but it has the same structure no matter who’s fronting. Since tourette’s syndrome, for example, is a result of the brain structure being different or “warped”, another alter would still have it. The alter may cause amnesia/memory loss but there is an extremely minuscule chance it would change the brain structure every time they fronted too. I have seen some people posted on this subreddit who also claim different alters can be paralysed from the waist/neck down when other alters don’t.. and wtf? Were they not taught body autonomy? \\n\\nThis is basic knowledge, but no, you can’t transfer your alters to another system. It’s not pokémon cards. You can’t trade them, you can’t have copies of them, just no. \\n\\nAnother thing that’s widely debated amongst medical professionals is fictives or irls or whatever these “systems” call them. Fictives do exist, but they are extremely rare and if one were to form, it would be before or around the age of 8 and would’ve taken multiple years, no Arson, not two years, two years isn’t long enough for your dream smp alters to form, it would’ve taken from around 8 years or more to form them. Fictives are formed when the brain latches onto a character that it thinks could protect them from harm and from the trauma that even caused their disorder. \\n\\nThis brings me onto my last point: endogenic systems. To put it simply; they aren’t real. You can have an imagination without claiming to have a severe lifelong traumatic disorder (minus the trauma in endogenic systems) and no one is going to attack you. DID is formed by multiple years of severe trauma, around or before the age of 8. It’s not your mom yelling at you to do your chores, it’s severe trauma. It’s trauma severe enough that the brain believes the original personality state would only be of harm if they remembered it, so it created other personality states that could take in the trauma. \\n\\nOne teensy last thing worth noting, you can’t switch alters on command. Alters switch when there is a negative trigger, that is a trauma response. It is kind of like how if someone with PTSD had a trigger of their trauma then they’d have a breakdown, except someone with DID would switch alters really subtly and then switch back when the threat is gone or over. You just can’t have a positive trigger either, because you wouldn’t know what each alter likes unless you were informed by a family member or your therapist. \\n\\nBefore I post this I wanted to say that every DID system is of course different, and if any GENUINE ones need to fix something i’ve said in the comments I will change my wording. I, myself, do not have DID so i can’t speak on behalf of the community, but this is just what i’ve found through research. \\n\\nSources: \\nDissociative disorders - NHS \\n\\nhttps://www.mind.org.uk › dissociati...What are dissociative disorders? - Mind \\n\\nhttps://www.sane.org › dissociative-i...Dissociative identity disorder (DID)\\n\\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com › dis...Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID): Symptoms, Traits, Causes, Treatment\\n\\nEDITS: \\n\\nFictives can form in the space of a year or more, but the amount of trauma that would’ve been caused then would’ve not allowed them to realise.

But I’m desperately looking for some help sorting out my past to make a better future. I’m a 23 year old male. \\nMy senior year of highschool, when it came to picking my college I really didn’t give nearly enough thought and I only looked at a few schools. The school I picked was a small conservative liberal arts catholic university a bit out of town. I honestly just picked it because of all the scholarships that I received and I was familiar with a small school. However, from the very beginning it didn’t feel right and I felt a deep dread inside me. I felt unworthy to have received scholarships and the school in general was cliquey with upper middle class students. I felt out of place and my freshmen year I made very little friends and I spent an extreme amount of time isolated and lonely. I felt out of my element and overwhelmed by the academics and social scene. I remember I would go weeks without talking to my roommate and looking back a feel like a total psychopath. I come from a lower middle class family and my parents both were working two jobs at the time. I felt an extreme amount of pressure to please them and not let them down. Sophomore year went a little better. Again I had a roommate who I didn’t speak to much and I ignored. I felt I couldn’t connect with him. It was another random roommate because I didn’t make any real connections my first year. I did join a rugby club and it felt good. I played football in highschool and it kept me busy and I made a good group of friends. I felt I missed that my freshmen year and I was happy to be apart of something again. My junior year fall semester went okay, again I never really felt deserving of being there. A few occasions I remember I isolated myself and I feel like i missed out on some opportunities because of how much I was in my head. That spring semester I was sent home because of covid and it felt good to be home and I didn’t mind online class too much. Fall semester senior year  I really lost control of my mental health. I seriously had a mental break down. I felt like a failure. I was back on campus in a sophomore dorm with a random because I didn’t make any really connections. I felt so bad like every thing I’ve done was a failure. I felt so lonely and pathetic. How could someone be at the same school for four years and still eat every meal alone? Then one week I started obsessing over my student loans. About 43,000 to be exact. And I kept thinking what happened to the deal I was getting. Also, I kept thinking 40 ground to be miserable. So, a few weeks into the semester I got some mental health help and I was put on a depression pill. One little hint of a suicidal thought and I attempted suicide. Obviously, I’m alive but it was more serious then I anticipated. Two weeks in a hospital room and 3 days in a psychiatric ward. I took a leave of absence on a medical leave and I’ve never went back. It’s been three semesters and I’m still enrolled as a student. I’ve been working full time the whole time I’ve been off at an entry level position at a manufacturing plant. I make about $20 bucks an hour and live at home. I have a few friends who I talk with and sit at lunch with and I get along well with management. I’m starting to think about going back to my academics and starting somewhere else. Fingers crossed that I get enough credits transferred to be at least a junior somewhere else. I know hindsight is 2020 and it’s easier to look back at things with rose colored glasses. However, highschool I never felt alone, I had a good group of friends. I went out on the weekends and I was involved in football and a few clubs. In college I felt like the outsider looking in and I felt like the geek from all the highschool films eating lunch in the bathroom. I know it’s not all about social life but I felt like such a loser. I feel good taking to the kids my age at work and even some of the older men and women. I feel good now working 40 plus hours and I feel good about my relationships at work. However, I feeling of dread is starting to happen. I feel crazy for throwing my college away and yet wanting to start somewhere else so late seems like lunacy when I think about it. I also know I could be more than I am now and this wasn’t the plan or the career path I wanted. I know I’ll be very unhappy if I wake Up 30 years from now and I’m still doing manual labor. Please help me sort out these overwhelming feelings. I’ll be about 24 in the next few months. Since I’ve been off these three semesters I’ve been with a psychiatrist and I’ve changed my meds a few times. The medicine I’m on now is helping and I feel like I have a clearer head. I was diagnosed with major depression and social anxiety. I feel like I have it under control. Thank you for reading this and taking the time to help me sort some of my thoughts and feelings out. I was a accounting major but it really stressed me out and I didn’t enjoy it nor did it come natural to me. Last time I checked I had a 3.2 gap.

However, my roommate (19F) keeps talking to her boyfriend loud on the phone at 1am, like it’s happening right now and it’s driving me insane. And I’m saying loud because even our neighbours have come knocking on our door telling us to quiet down.

I’m feeling a lot of shame over my performance and lack of responsibility as a student and feel lost on how to get back on track.\\n\\nThere’s been a lot going on family wise. One of my older siblings has severe OCD that manifested over the pandemic. Although their tsymptoms have improved since the start it is rather hard to watch a family member deteriorate so much and be unable to help. They, understandably, find exposure therapy difficult to bear, and we cannot afford in-patient as we lack health insurance. I find myself constantly worried about them. Selfishly, I mourn the way I can no longer rely on them emotionally, as they were always a pillar of support for me.\\n\\nThis is an ongoing problem, and one I struggled with for a while, but it reached its peak this semester with the suicide attempt of my older sibling. It was more an impulsive call for help (with, thank god, no lasting medical consequences) and my sibling has admitted they didn’t actually want to die. I am still very much haunted by it: I had to tell my family to get out of the emergency room they were in as soon as possible and wait to head to urgent care instead, which was a horrible choice to make. At the time it happened, I missed all my classes for more than a week, and did not communicate with most of my professors (I am usually good on this point, but I simply could not bring myself to).\\n\\nI made attempts to recover since then, but I find that I cannot cope with the slightest emotional difficulty or inconvenience. Missing classes have become an unfortunate pattern. I have missed class over trivial things such as:\\n- students criticizing the way an event I was heavily involved in was run (long wait times)\\n- my advisor of two years mistaking me for the fourth time (but only twice this semester/year) of another student of the same race (last year it was with another person)\\n- feeling like it’s too late for me to succeed in class\\n- not wanting to work on a group project in class with my limited progress\\n\\nAfter a botched midterm, I have decided to withdraw from one of my class. For the others, I am upset at how irresponsible I’ve been, my lack of contributions to the class, my continued failure to meet deadlines, my lack of communication. I have a paper I have not turned in for a month, and I have ignored emails from my professor asking to meet for no logical reason I can give.

My mom wanted me safe at home, they even got me a care during my semester off. My mom said “I want you to have this car so you do not feel like you have to do online school. You can commute” Anyways I came to the conclusion I want to go back to Rowan(2 hours away from home).**\\n\\n**I told my dad about it and he said it’s your future and if that’s what you wanna do I’m OK with it. I told my mom about it and she was not OK with it. She said she would take my car away and that last year was a hard time for her and she basically can’t handle me going back to Rowan. She said knowing me I’m probably going to come back home eventually. I told her to be more optimistic and if she keeps thinking like I can’t do anything in my life.** \\n\\n**I understand where she’s coming from though, she is my mom and she is worried. I really want to go back to Rowan University because Like before I can able to focus on school work more. The main problems I had my freshman and sophomore year was living with other people and I would typically run away to be by myself. If I were to go back I would make sure to have my own room and I also now receive accommodations from the University since I was diagnosed.** \\n\\n**i’d also like to mention that I’ve been on and off for therapy just because it’s hard to find one that is right for me. I feel like since I’m not going to therapy currently that also gives her a reason for me to not go back to Rowan. She says “You never like anyone and change therapist so easily”.**\\n\\n**Being at home stresses me out more. I live in a Hispanic family and they have get togethers every weekend and I’m expected to always be there. But when I was at college, dooming, the expectation was gone because the first thing that came up in there mind was that I was studying. But if I were at home they would assume that I can fit everything in my schedule from studying to being with my family and work. There’s just so much expectation staying at home.

I destroyed my body and mind to get through school and it’s done nothing for me but traumatize me. \\n\\nI had issues with depression and anxiety before school but it just made everything so much worse. I went to a largish school that was really focused on Greek life for the degree programs (a terrible decision by 18yo me, from a very small town). I remained an outsider there and never really made friends, failed to click with any clubs or groups. \\n\\nMy whole life my family’s dream for me was to go to college, so I felt like I couldn’t fail them or go to them when I was struggling. I also have commitment issues so I didn’t feel like I could switch schools. \\n\\nI became extremely, extremely isolated. I would go weeks without talking to anyone except for an older lady who would check me into the cafeteria. I didn’t have a car the first two years so I couldn’t really go home, I was just stuck up there except for thanksgiving and winter breaks. I was too mentally to work so I didn’t have any extra money. Also, I didn’t understand how my meal plan worked so I was just eating 1 meal a day for a long time. \\n\\nI became extremely depressed, anxiety skyrocketed to the point of daily panic attacks, touch starved, and suicidal. I just wanted the pain to stop. I buried myself in school work, escaped through social media, and basically shut off all emotion and went into survival mode so I could push through. Never made a true friend, never had a relationship, never went to a party. \\n\\nThings got better once I had a car for the last 2 1/2 years and I could visit home. For two semesters during COVID lockdown I actually got to work on school from home, which helped a lot, but then my last semester we were back in person. There it all came back and it got worse again. \\n\\nI feel like I was a ghost, no one ever noticed me or knew I existed. After graduation I basically had a nervous breakdown and I moved back in with my family. I would constantly have panic attacks even after leaving and every night in my nightmares I would be back there working on endless projects and stressing about tests I didn’t study for, or back in the dorm bunk beds wishing I wouldn’t wake up. Certain smells or things would also take me back. Even driving through the city the college is in I break out in a cold sweat. I feel like I’m still mentally stuck there and still mentally 18 years old. \\n\\nLuckily my family intervened and got me medication and therapy, but other than stopping the panic attacks the meds didn’t do much for my mental health and my social anxiety was too much for talk therapy.\\n\\nAfter all that I sacrificed and all I destroyed in my health I’m still in my hometown barely holding onto a job that only requires a high school diploma. I can’t move out due to financial reasons and I can’t go to another city because my whole support  system is here. \\n\\nAlso, I’m still deeply lonely. I feel like I have a void or a brokenness inside me that will never be better. I feel numb and like I’m not an active part in my own life. I’m still hurting. I’ve been really impulsive lately and I’ve been spending more money on stupid things I don’t need. I’m wanting more and more to just numb out with alcohol and weed (I haven’t actually gone that far yet but it’s harder to resist). I really want a relationship and to have my own family but all of this is in the way and I can barely care for myself. \\n\\nI feel like there was no reason for me to go through what I did, and the school can just keep on churning students through like nothing happened. What was all of this for? How do I stop feeling this way?\\n\\nThis diploma is nothing but a piece of paper that says I did what others told me to do for four years of my life and my youth that I will never get back', 'Supporting Friend My son’s good friend since preschool chose to go to the same local college as my son, and they both live in the dorms.

I fell too far behind in several classes and had to drop some of them.\\n\\n\\nIn high school I studied so, so much and got amazing grades. However, I lost motivation in the second half of my last semester after I got into my dream school and program, and I still haven't gotten it back even though it's almost been a year. I failed every quiz in one of my math classes - even though it used to be my best subject - and I had to drop it so it wouldn't show up on my transcript.\\n\\n\\nIt's not the fact that my grades are worse than high school. That doesn't bother me in the least bit. It's the fact that I hate everything about school and the program that I'm in. I find no joy in any of it. The subject I really wanted to pursue I wasn't allowed to (understandably, since there's not a very good job outlook for it). I can't really switch into anything else because I'm not very good in other subjects due to covid-19 and not truly learning as much as I usually would.\\n\\n\\nI stopped doing extracurriculars after 1.5 months because I was too depressed to go, and going to them brought me more stress and dread than not going even though I enjoyed them.\\n\\n\\nI would wake up and cry every morning and cry myself to sleep. I'd spend everyday alone in my dorm because I don't want to leave. I'd sleep through every lecture because I couldn't sleep during the night, and when I woke up in the morning, my lectures were already finished.\\n\\n\\nI've seen guidance counsellors and I saw doctors about depression and am on medication for it. I'm currently on a wait-list for mental health counselling.\\n\\n\\nEven after all that, I still hate everything about university. I haven't made any friends since I don't leave my dorm much anymore, but that doesn't bother me since I like being alone, and I call with my high school friends everyday. Even though I'm in one of the best programs in Canada, I hate it. The campus and the city is dull, the dorm feels more like a prison building, I find no joy in anything related to school, and I don't want to go back. I would rather throw myself off of a building and die instead of go back.\\n\\n\\nI don't have the option to take a leave of absence, and I certainly can't drop out.

I’m from Malaysia, and the pandemic hit right when I graduated from highschool. Throughout lockdown, I took A-Levels locally, but a lot of mental health issues came up and long story short, I’m currently on anti-depressants after a suicide attempt.\\n\\nI reached out to my teachers during this time and while they were sympathetic, they didn’t offer accommodations or anything that could help me. I missed a lot of online classes and failed to digest a lot of information during this time. While most A-Levels take 2 years, the institutes here offer an accelerated course for 1.5 years only.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, I failed most of my exams and my predicted grades are E’s and U’s. I really want to study Biomedicine in the University of Sheffield, UK, but I don’t have the grades for it. It’s also expensive and I would only be able to study in the UK if I could get something like a partial scholarship. Is it worth sitting for A-Levels again? I really hate the idea of sitting for those exams again, but I will if it’s the best choice. I’m also 19, and far older than most of my peers. Feeling a bit hopeless right now.\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, I’ve been thinking about doing a transfer programme in Taylor’s University, a private uni in Kuala Lumpur. I would be able to do 1 year in KL and finish my Bachelors in University of Sheffield. The reason why I am thinking this is a possibility is because I can get a scholarship in Taylor’s. However, I am worried about job prospects as I wish to migrate to the UK and work there, becoming a permanent resident. Would they look down on my degree, if I did this? \\n\\nFYI, I also plan on studying until I at least get a Master’s. Any advice would be helpful, thanks!', \"How do I do well in college as an adult? I'm 25 years old and I've decided to go back to school. Long story short, I didnt do well in high school. At all. My mom had stage 4 kidney disease and my sister was depressed/suicidal, both of these things occurred the minute I became a freshman and lasted well into my early 20's. I put school off after I graduated to take care of my mom and forgot about myself up until recently. I have a GPA of 2.0 and my grades were abysmal. Despite how bad that looks, I'm actually a good student, which makes my high school transcript all the more painful to look at.

I still struggle and have my good and bad times but I think I’m finally one step ahead and actually want to live my life and be happy.  But now I have no idea wtf to do and how to live lol.  So this is the plan I came out with so far —- I am homeschooled and use the Abeka program.  I want to finish these last 2 years the same way I previously done them.  With their program I will not be able to graduate with a hs diploma because I will be too old and also not have enough credits.  But I want to continue doing that because I don’t want to let myself down and prove to myself I can finish what I started and regain some control back of the years I lost to my mental illnesses.  So then after that I want to get my GED.  I have a passion for makeup and art and combining those together.  So meanwhile I’m finishing hs I want to get that rolling with creative and expressive makeup on social media.  Then I can I can get my bachelor’s or associate’s with cosmetology specializing in makeup.  I would probably also take some English/Literature and psychology classes cause those are my other interests.  Then I can start my own makeup artist program as an entrepreneur and do either your basic makeup or stage/movie/special effect.

Studied hard and did a lot of stuff in high school and followed the rules to get into a good undergrad college. In reality, not so much. As any typical high-achieving child of parents who moved to the US for work/business, I had a high GPA. I started undergrad as hopeful as any other student. As a warning, I will mention serious mental health issues, including suicide. \\n\\nTo sum it up super quickly, a lot of stuff happened, and my grades tanked. Mental health went down the drain, and I even tried to end it permanently. So because of this, I took some time off and went home. I finished two years of college. My grades were great, but that one bad semester has plummeted my GPA. And it’s not like I was focused on extracurriculars when I was fighting to literally survive. I have basically one activity I can put on my college resume. But I am going to go back.\\n\\nExcept I don’t know what to do now for grad school. I realize how ironic it is that I’m worried about my future given the above. But now that my GPA has been lowered greatly, and I have only one notable activity that isn’t even related to my major, I don’t know what to do. Currently, I can’t work for legal reasons in another long story involving immigration laws, so anything paid is out of the question.  I sabotaged my own future. My mental health was so bad I tried to end everything because I wanted to stop being a burden on my family and I wanted the pain to stop. I was so tired. I just wanted everything to stop. Now that it has, having withdrawn from school, I just feel worthless and stupid.

I have a number of mental issues that are ESA-applicable. I don\\'t plan on bringing a \"traditional\" support animal like a dog or cat but a gecko I already have.

I've tried to get treatment but it really doesn't do much. I've never been depressed, though, and this situation is the first time I've ever felt suicidal. I've had shitty living conditions before, but nothing this hostile.\\n\\nMy dorm is medium sized, only housing around 80 people. As a result, we have a dorm group chat to discuss any situation that arises. There's been a lot of issues with cleanliness, but honestly those don't bother me very much. It's not so much that the people in the chat are unreasonable, because everyone deserves to be able to live their life without facing constant interruptions and noises. No, its more that the dorm itself isn't conductive to living with other people. Its one of those buildings where a mouse on the third floor sounds like an elephant in the second. Between that and a lot of other issues, the people in the chat have gotten really agressive, which again, I get. Still, everything is an issue. A single strand of hair in the sink turns into a thirty minute argument. Theres constant bickering over quiet hours. Walking around late at night gets you yelled at. Throwing away hair in the trash but not covering it up is gross, stuff like that. \\n\\nI've also gotten a noise complaint from my roomate for listening to music with my earphones, even though it was at less than half the volume. I hear her wake up and sigh every time I walk in at night to get my stuff to shower. I'm really trying my best to be quiet, but I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and have bad night vision, so I know I'm being way louder than is reasonable. I know I'm a terrible roomate, which is part of the reason I tried getting a single room this year.\\n\\nAnd the chat is a constant reminder that I'm really not fit to live in shared accomodations. I've only fucked up once or twice, but its a constant reminder that my continued existence in the dorm is a bad thing for the people around me. I'm  scared to breathe too loud when I hide in the bathroom because I feel like they'll hear me and they'll hate me. I recognize that this isn't a healthy thinking pattern, but after I absentmindedly made some noise yesterday night in the shower and got told off for it, I started to actually contemplate suicide for the first time in my life. I feel like a burden of everyone, and like an impediment to their ability to enjoy their dorm life. I feel like I'm too loud and too weird to derve to be here. I know I don't deserve to live here, because if I was a good dormmate I wouldn't have to constantly remind myself that I'm not allowed to make noise and that I can't talk or pace or make my weird little mouth noises that I make when I'm exited. I know when I'm happy I'm too loud, so I don't deserve to be happy is it's impacting everyone elses ability to be happy.\\n\\nIt feels like I'm trapped in solitary confinement at the panopticon, where I'm surronded by people that are always watching my every move and want me dead. I'm alone here, except I'm  never alone, because I can't even cry when I hide in the bathroom because it's too loud and I'm afraid of getting yelled at. Everywhere I feel eyes on me, like people are maliciously trying to get me to mess up so they can punish me. I feel like I'm under constant survellaince until they find out how weird I am and that I'm an impostor and a predator and deserve to die. I know this is irrational becausr no one cares that much about me anyways, but I can't continue on like this. I just want to die.\\n\\nAnyways, I know there's not really a solution. Residential Services are trying to move me to a different dorm, but I don't think that will help much. I'm still going to be intruding on my roomates life. I'm still going to have to constantly remind myself that my happiness is actively damaging to the people around me. There's a severe housing shortage, to the point that there's not even emergency accomodations available. I know Im not going to get a single. I can't sleep because people are watching. I can't cry or I'm a bad person. I'm already hogging up the bathroom too much because I lock myself in there all night so I can hide from how awful I am at not making my roomate's sleep miserable. I know this isn't rational, but my brain knows it to be true. I feel like my only two options are to die or drop out of college. I'm not cut out for this like how normal people are, so it feels like it's a better choice to just give up instead of putting a burden on people.\", 'What’s the worst professor you’ve ever had? What’s the best? What did they do to make them the best or worst?\\n\\n**edit:** I have another HORRIBLE professor story I wanted to add in.  I was taking a probability class over summer last year and also working on campus.  I ended up reporting my boss for sexual harassment and my department did an investigation and found enough stuff on his PC to warrant him being immediately fired and banned from campus.  The same day they fired him, he was found dead by suicide.  I had a lot of issues handling this, emotionally, and the Dean of Students and campus counseling came to my aid to support me through it.  I was very grateful towards them.  The same week this happened, I had a midterm in my probability class.  The dean personally spoke to my teacher to ask him to be mindful of my circumstances and give me extra time to prepare for the test and to take it later in the week.  He refused, told me to not be lazy and to \"hire a tutor if the class is so hard for you\" and gave me a list of tutors starting off at $50/hr.  I didn\\'t need help studying, I just needed more time and considering I quit my job after what happened, I definitely didn\\'t have $50/hr to throw at anyone anyway..... I ended up getting a C+ in the class and therapy, no thanks to how much of an asshole the teacher was.  I\\'ve since told all my fellow math students to not take any classes from him because he has no sympathy for students and he wasn\\'t even a good teacher to begin with.\\n\\n**worst**: I took a CS - based discrete math course, and the teacher for that was the fucking worst. It was a large class (auditorium-sizes class), and so the teacher had a teaching assistant. It became pretty clear early on that she had no like or respect for students and I’m pretty sure she was only teaching because she had to, but she was more interested in her research work. She often rushed lecture, she refused to slow down for anyone that asked (and would openly mock them for asking), and she was very unforgiving with grades. As in, if a problem was a multi-parter with parts (a) to (d) and you partially got (c) incorrect, the entire problem would be marked zero.  At the first midterm, she started the test by saying she put some common mathematic formulas on the back of the exams for “all the morons in the room who never bothered to learn basic math”. I left that test, reported her to the CS department, and dropped the class. \\n\\n**best**: On the flip side, the next semester, I took a math-based discrete math course from a strict but very fair mathematician who was very knowledgeable and had a good way to help students understand difficult concepts in more basic terms. I had to work my ass off in that class, but I learned so much and I really respect the teacher.\\n\\nI ended up switching majors from cs to math/stats, partially as a result of these two teachers.', \"Well paying job for young parent doing part time schooling.   19M with a baby boy due in less than a month, living in rural Florida (Okeechobee).

I'm a high school senior who's starting university soon. It's one of my most desired goals to study abroad to get quality education and meet new people from different backgrounds in new different environments.

My gpa dropped to a 2.9. so I decided to take a semester off, thinking things would be better. \\n\\nAfter the semester off, I went back to school Fall 2019. I had ANOTHER suicide attempt (did not end up in the hospital) and ended up medically withdrawing from all classes.\\n\\nThis seems to happen every fall.

One of my professors also told me that i should not suffer this much during my academic journey. \\nAlso I know my dad would be so disappointed because, If I drop out, that means his 3 children have tried and have dropped out. \\nAlso, It scares me the idea of regretting it in the future.

Remember that college grades are just grades and that our lives are precious, stay safe everyone.', \"How bad is it that I pursued research fellowships instead of internships in college? A little background on me. I will receive my degree in January, graduating a semester early. When starting college, I struggled a lot, and the past year was the only really good year of college that I had in a decent mental state. It has been a journey, but I am here. I have an in demand degree (Applied Mathematics/Data Analytics) and also picked up three minors in biology, chemistry, and biostatistics. I have a very high GPA (3.85), as I was planning for a while to attend medical school or grad school if that did not pan out. Now, I am thinking about working in industry for a little bit doing something else before I go onto further education due to financial circumstances. \\n\\nBeing that I wanted to go to med school (I decided this during my junior year, so kind of late), I focused A LOT on my grades. I took a research fellowship (was told they were just as good, especially for STEM majors) the last two summers instead of internships because that felt more practical for where I was going. I have three poster presentations (2 at national conferences) and my first paper is in review to get published right now. I'm worried that because of this, I will be limited in the job search because I did research instead of internships. I have had a myriad of other jobs during college including being a full-time nanny, tutor, orientation leader, and teaching assistant for a chem lab. I also have a bunch of different volunteer experiences, including working for a suicide line once a week for the last year. I did a summer internship in high school through my community, and they liked me so much that they kept me on during the school year and summers for three years. I'm not sure I can list that as relevant anymore, though. It also doesn't necessarily pertain to STEM at all. I've got a LinkedIn with a few hundred connections, my family has additional connections in several fields, and every professor I have ever had has liked me. So, I am hoping I can use that as an advantage (also that I went to a smaller school and was able to build real relationships with my professors easier). \\n\\nAre there any people who have been in this situation and still found luck? Any advice? I am just worried that I may have screwed myself a little bit because my plan isn't going exactly as I laid it out initially. I think that I will offer a lot to different companies, but I am worried they won't see that because I didn't do an internship. \", 'I don’t know how much more of this shit I can take man It’s the beginning of the semester and I’m already stressed, family problems at home, in life in general, I couldn’t even pass a plagiarism test worth five points though it was hard as shit.

The going out scene was all frat based, in which you always had to know like 3 or 4 girls to even get into most parties. People there were cliquey, dismissive, most of the people I met were generally just pieces of shit. Ended the first year with a 2.9 GPA, not great but passable; choosing a degree that my parents wanted for me and not something I actually enjoyed was probably part of it.\\n\\nTransferred my sophomore year and things radically improved, despite COVID hitting. Ended with a 3.2 after I switched to English (my passion), met a good group of friends. Only issue was that I started going out more, and thus got sucked into an insidious form of functioning alcoholism that I'm still digging myself out of.\\n\\nJunior year I bombed all of my classes. I was depressed, I lived far away from all my other friends off campus and my alcohol use got even worse. Switched my major to psychology at the request of my parents. Absolutely destroyed my GPA from a 3.2 to a 2.5. Had a suicide attempt and a bunch of failed relationships which annihilated my self confidence.\\n\\nNow this year. I've managed to bring my GPA back up to a 2.7 but it's still so shit. I convinced my parents to let me stay with English mostly by the fact that I would probably flunk out of school if I didn't. Have been working on myself this year and kicked a lot of bad habits but it's made me realize how screwed I am for the future. I wasted so much money and time not having a backbone to not only push back my parents but also to live a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nI'm so terrified of having to work a retail job or similar my whole life, having no grad school or internship prospects. My GPA is terrible and my major isn't like CS or engineering where a low GPA can still get you decent jobs. I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck for decades and it's all because of my poor choices and my parent's influence. At the retail job I work now nearly all of the graduates who work there were all on a humanities and it scares me that this is just going to be my life until I (hopefully) can retire and die.\", \"Can my university psychiatrist do this? So at the beginning of the semester I was regularly talking to a referral person/psychiatrist about some stuff. About two weeks ago I emailed both to discontinue services because it wasn't very helpful and caused me more stress. I got a call on tuesday from my psychiatrist who basically told me that if I didn't get full lab work/ekg to assess my health she would report me to the dean of students? Can she do that? Also, I said I was not suicidal nor have I been considering self harm so that can't be her reason for wanting to tell the dean of students. If there's a better sub for this, let me know. If you need more specific information about my situation, dm me, I don't mind giving more details\", 'Transferring from community college I am 19, a comp sci major, and am class of 25’. I failed my first semester of community college due to my mental health deteriorating. This is severely bringing down my gpa because one of the classes I failed was a five credit course. Second semester I did much better but I have a 1.6 gpa. In the summer I decided to take two courses that I ended up receiving an “NA” grade because i was dealing with a problem with pay at work. I met with an advisor to discuss my situation and he roughly mapped out my courses for this fall, spring, and fall of 23. I need 39+ more credits to transfer and I currently only have 13. To make matters worse, I live in a very controlling toxic conservative household and want to move out as fast as I can. I have no idea how long it’s going to take for me to finish those credits but the longer I stay at my home the more I feel suicidal and I’m truly worried I will take my own life. It doesn’t help that socially I’m watching everyone progress while l feel so behind. I know this is consequences for my actions but I seriously feel depressed because I don’t think I can transfer by next fall anymore.

Hello, I live in Florida and have been through several things that I feel as though are grant worthy. i.e. being adopted, being a ward of the state, having my mother and father both pass, and my grandma being lost to suicide.

I'm so lost and scared. I'm a 21 year old (F) junior college student with around 60 credits so far. I'm supposed to be class of 24, but will graduate with class of 25 at this rate. I'm considering dropping out due to mental health issues. My parents pay for my tuition and it is something I'm very grateful for. However the guilt is starting to take a major toll on me. While I've kept an acceptable 3+ GPA, I just fear so much for my future, and fear I won't be a useful, functioning member of society. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD, autism, social anxiety (extremely severe) and depression so trying to function like a normal human being is quite hard for me, I feel like I won't make it in the future. I also think I might be stupid, like genuinely stupid, like some kind of condition. Some of the things I find myself doing screams incompetent.\\n\\nSo when my parents are wasting away money for someone who is probably hopeless, I feel absolutely sick to my stomach. I've considered suicide many times but I just can't bring myself to do it knowing how much money has been spent on me, so I'm pretty much stuck here. If I didn't go to college, I at least could've killed myself knowing my parents wouldn't resent me for burning their money. I haven't had a job throughout my college career, and have only had a job that lasted for one year when I was 16, and I feel like I could do more, but I feel like my grades would struggle and prolong my college years even more. I have applied for a few internships next year, but I guess I'll see what happens with that. I have considered dropping out and joining a trade school, which is something I probably should've done and I feel like I would be more healthy had I just done that from the beginning but I'm already halfway through. I feel like an absolute small child. Just a child trapped in a adults body, and life is moving so fast and it puts me to tears just thinking about it. I wish I was financially independent, I wish I could be proud of the work in, there is probably a sense of accomplishment from doing things on your own even if it's more difficult. I still live in dorms, and not in apartments. Never had to deal with rent. I want to feel like an actual adult but deep down probably won't be able to do most things on my own. I accidently got myself into an argument with my dad, and he brought up that most college students pay for their own tuition worsening my guilt.\\n\\nMy grades are starting to struggle, I'm losing sleep, I genuinely have no idea what the hell to do with my life, and seeing people I'm close to constantly succeed and doing things on their own with such ease while I struggle with basic things is extremely discouraging. I feel like I'm like 3 years behind. This honestly feels like the end for me. What say you random reddit stranger? I'm sorry if I seem like an ungrateful shit. Sorry if I went off topic and vented, I guess the main point is I surprisingly miss being a little girl and being naïve. I would probably rather trust random redditors to make my life decisions than myself at this point, knowing I'll probably fuck it all up. I'm so tired of living this life. I want out, I want out. (English isn't my first language so sorry for the trash English.)\", \"Concerns about dropping out. How to break the news? Basically I am heavily considering dropping out of college. I am a first year student in my second semester. I am currently studying as an international student (American) in Australia. \\n\\nBackground: I am 20 years old. At 18 years old I enrolled at a University of California campus. I suffer from some pretty severe mental health issues. Two weeks in I had to drop out due to a suicide attempt. However, while I was there I participated in an organic farm internship. I really enjoyed it. \\n\\nI then took a gap year and worked as a server in a retirement home. I adored it. I made enough to move out, and started a small savings by getting a second job working overnight shifts at a gym. \\n\\nI applied to university for a bachelors of agricultural science and technology. I chose the university based on its highly regarded agricultural science program. My goal was to learn to become a farm manager, in hopes of one day running a small-scale organic farm. I realized first semester that my goals were not compatible with the course material. I got high grades, but despised what I was learning (commercial broad-acre farming, pesticides use, herbicide use, etc.) This semester I decided to change my major to environmental science. I am almost one month in and feel like I have been disillusioned. I am being prepped to work for a mining or oil company as they dominate the Western Australian economy and have ties to the university. I am not willing to work for an ultra exploitative company or the government. My other option with this degree would be research. I am not strong in math, data science, or statistics, so this feels out of the question. \\n\\nI have around two days to unenroll from my course and receive back my tuition for this semester. \\n\\nI am extremely privileged in that my grandfather has set aside a college savings fund, and has been paying for my tuition thus far. I am feeling immense guilt over dropping out. I feel as though it would be a waste of money if I was to do so. In addition, I would be letting down his expectations of me. \\n\\nUnfortunately I feel as though the course will only get more unbearable. If I drop out now I am preventing the risk of me dropping out later. I could try and push through this semester and the next two years, but I know I will be unhappy. \\n\\nMy plan once I return home is to get my CNA license. Working in a retirement home was fulfilling and I can envision myself in healthcare. Whereas I can no longer envision myself working as an agricultural or environmental scientist. My grandfather will be extremely disappointed if I was to drop out. He will not be happy with my decision to become a CNA. I understand the position doesn't make as much as an environmental scientist, but I should be able to sustain myself. I live a very frugal lifestyle and work hard. My parents understand this and are thankfully supportive. They have told me to pursue what makes me happy. \\n\\nAny opinion on what I should do? How to break the news to my grandfather? Am I being delusional for wasting so much money this past year? Thanks. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\", 'How do you know if you’re mentally strong enough for the psychology field? I’m a sophomore in undergrad and i’m trying to decide between psychology and environmental science for my major. One of the things I’m concerned about is if i’m strong enough mentally to go into this field. I’ve had some issues with what I think might be depression/anxiety for a couple years now but i’ve just started seeing a therapist. I think what I want is to be in some type of therapist role, but i’m just concerned about the mental toll it will take on me. If I become a therapist what if one of my clients ends up committing suicide?

I am currently a freshman at my local community college. My original plan was to stay here for two years and then transfer to a university, to save a little bit of money.\\n\\nUnfortunately, living with my parents has been very rocky and it’s getting worse by the day. I won’t delve too much into the situation (reports to CPS, suicide attempts, blah blah blah) but I really just want to get out of here as soon as possible.\\n\\nAnyways, my parents are currently not helping pay for my tuition. They promised the kids (I have two older siblings) that they had a college fund set aside for each of us. They gave my brother and sister a lot of money (not sure how much exactly, but in the thousands) as well as completing the FAFSA for them to assist them further.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my parents refuse to fill out the FAFSA for me. They are… how should I word this… anti-government?? They are against giving the government their information for some reason, even though they did it for my brother and sister (and they still do their taxes lmao). And no, I cannot change their minds. I already tried to no avail. I was recently offered a student aide position at my current school. For students working on campus their tuition is cut by almost half. I couldn’t take the job because my parents refused to fill out the FAFSA, which was required in the final paperwork by my college in order to work there.\\n\\nI’ve worked part-time since I was a freshman in high school. My first year of community college was just under $12,000 (without the FAFSA. So much for being cheaper). I spent all of my life savings on my first year here. I literally only have a few hundred dollars left in my bank account.\\n\\nWhen I mentioned I was thinking about transferring one year early, my mother said she and my father will not financially support me at all anymore. Meaning, they will take the money out of my college fund and, I don’t know, go on vacation with the money or something. They don’t want me being “brainwashed” by the professors at university and instead want to be able to watch me at home so I don’t turn into a liberal LOL (you probably understand why I want to leave now).\\n\\nI really need some advice on what I can do. I desperately want to leave, but I have barely any money. I work a minimum wage job about 10-15 hours a week, because my hours were recently cut. And no, I cannot get a new job, because my family only owns one car and my mom refuses to let me drive it and she refuses to drive me further than a mile to my job, because she says it is wasting her time :/\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read!\\n\\nEdit: Yup. You read it right: $12,000. The community college I am attending is technically in the county next to the one I live in, so I am paying out-of-district tuition. Why?

And I’m saying loud because even our neighbours have come knocking on our door telling us to quiet down. I’ve asked her if she can try to talk quieter or something when I’m trying to sleep or study but she always talks back saying something among the lines of “You’re just jealous you don’t have what we have” or “stop being so sensitive”.

I hate dragging myself to class every day and I hate physically being on campus. Being within 100 yards of that campus feels like a vampire is slowly sucking the life out of me. I hate making small talk with my professors, smiling and asking questions during class and generally acting like I give a shit about anything we\\'re doing. I hate reading my textbooks, my attention issues have gotten so bad I can hardly read a few paragraphs before my brain starts crapping out. I hate all of the social pressures.

It\\'ll be another $5,000 of my parents hard earned money down the drain, and I can\\'t fucking stand the idea of making this school that I hate so much just a little richer. I\\'m so angry. All I ever feel anymore is either anger, crushing anxiety, or sadness. I feel completely trapped. I\\'ve heard so many stories of people I went to school with (and know some of them personally) who couldn\\'t cut it in college because of their emotional issues, so they dropped out and now spend their days working a menial job and pissing away their precious time.

', 'Suicide attempt senior year of college This is going be very long and I apologize I’m not a very good writer. But I’m desperately looking for some help sorting out my past to make a better future. I’m a 23 year old male. \\nMy senior year of highschool, when it came to picking my college I really didn’t give nearly enough thought and I only looked at a few schools. The school I picked was a small conservative liberal arts catholic university a bit out of town. I honestly just picked it because of all the scholarships that I received and I was familiar with a small school. However, from the very beginning it didn’t feel right and I felt a deep dread inside me. I felt unworthy to have received scholarships and the school in general was cliquey with upper middle class students. I felt out of place and my freshmen year I made very little friends and I spent an extreme amount of time isolated and lonely. I felt out of my element and overwhelmed by the academics and social scene. I remember I would go weeks without talking to my roommate and looking back a feel like a total psychopath. I come from a lower middle class family and my parents both were working two jobs at the time. I felt an extreme amount of pressure to please them and not let them down. Sophomore year went a little better. Again I had a roommate who I didn’t speak to much and I ignored. I felt I couldn’t connect with him. It was another random roommate because I didn’t make any real connections my first year. I did join a rugby club and it felt good. I played football in highschool and it kept me busy and I made a good group of friends. I felt I missed that my freshmen year and I was happy to be apart of something again. My junior year fall semester went okay, again I never really felt deserving of being there. A few occasions I remember I isolated myself and I feel like i missed out on some opportunities because of how much I was in my head. That spring semester I was sent home because of covid and it felt good to be home and I didn’t mind online class too much. Fall semester senior year  I really lost control of my mental health. I seriously had a mental break down. I felt like a failure. I was back on campus in a sophomore dorm with a random because I didn’t make any really connections. I felt so bad like every thing I’ve done was a failure. I felt so lonely and pathetic. How could someone be at the same school for four years and still eat every meal alone? Then one week I started obsessing over my student loans. About 43,000 to be exact. And I kept thinking what happened to the deal I was getting. Also, I kept thinking 40 ground to be miserable. So, a few weeks into the semester I got some mental health help and I was put on a depression pill. One little hint of a suicidal thought and I attempted suicide. Obviously, I’m alive but it was more serious then I anticipated. Two weeks in a hospital room and 3 days in a psychiatric ward. I took a leave of absence on a medical leave and I’ve never went back. It’s been three semesters and I’m still enrolled as a student. I’ve been working full time the whole time I’ve been off at an entry level position at a manufacturing plant. I make about $20 bucks an hour and live at home. I have a few friends who I talk with and sit at lunch with and I get along well with management. I’m starting to think about going back to my academics and starting somewhere else. Fingers crossed that I get enough credits transferred to be at least a junior somewhere else. I know hindsight is 2020 and it’s easier to look back at things with rose colored glasses. However, highschool I never felt alone, I had a good group of friends. I went out on the weekends and I was involved in football and a few clubs. In college I felt like the outsider looking in and I felt like the geek from all the highschool films eating lunch in the bathroom. I know it’s not all about social life but I felt like such a loser. I feel good taking to the kids my age at work and even some of the older men and women. I feel good now working 40 plus hours and I feel good about my relationships at work. However, I feeling of dread is starting to happen. I feel crazy for throwing my college away and yet wanting to start somewhere else so late seems like lunacy when I think about it. I also know I could be more than I am now and this wasn’t the plan or the career path I wanted. I know I’ll be very unhappy if I wake Up 30 years from now and I’m still doing manual labor. Please help me sort out these overwhelming feelings. I’ll be about 24 in the next few months. Since I’ve been off these three semesters I’ve been with a psychiatrist and I’ve changed my meds a few times. The medicine I’m on now is helping and I feel like I have a clearer head. I was diagnosed with major depression and social anxiety. I feel like I have it under control. Thank you for reading this and taking the time to help me sort some of my thoughts and feelings out. I was a accounting major but it really stressed me out and I didn’t enjoy it nor did it come natural to me. Last time I checked I had a 3.2 gap. So, I I’d say I’m a capable college student but obviously no I’m the top of the class. If I go back I would like to major in something a little bit less stressful. Something more manageable for myself.', 'How to bounce back academically after family suicide attempt I am almost halfway through the spring semester and have not been doing well, to say in the least. I’m feeling a lot of shame over my performance and lack of responsibility as a student and feel lost on how to get back on track.\\n\\nThere’s been a lot going on family wise. One of my older siblings has severe OCD that manifested over the pandemic. Although their tsymptoms have improved since the start it is rather hard to watch a family member deteriorate so much and be unable to help. They, understandably, find exposure therapy difficult to bear, and we cannot afford in-patient as we lack health insurance. I find myself constantly worried about them. Selfishly, I mourn the way I can no longer rely on them emotionally, as they were always a pillar of support for me.\\n\\nThis is an ongoing problem, and one I struggled with for a while, but it reached its peak this semester with the suicide attempt of my older sibling. It was more an impulsive call for help (with, thank god, no lasting medical consequences) and my sibling has admitted they didn’t actually want to die. I am still very much haunted by it: I had to tell my family to get out of the emergency room they were in as soon as possible and wait to head to urgent care instead, which was a horrible choice to make. At the time it happened, I missed all my classes for more than a week, and did not communicate with most of my professors (I am usually good on this point, but I simply could not bring myself to).\\n\\nI made attempts to recover since then, but I find that I cannot cope with the slightest emotional difficulty or inconvenience. Missing classes have become an unfortunate pattern. I have missed class over trivial things such as:\\n- students criticizing the way an event I was heavily involved in was run (long wait times)\\n- my advisor of two years mistaking me for the fourth time (but only twice this semester/year) of another student of the same race (last year it was with another person)\\n- feeling like it’s too late for me to succeed in class\\n- not wanting to work on a group project in class with my limited progress\\n\\nAfter a botched midterm, I have decided to withdraw from one of my class. For the others, I am upset at how irresponsible I’ve been, my lack of contributions to the class, my continued failure to meet deadlines, my lack of communication. I have a paper I have not turned in for a month, and I have ignored emails from my professor asking to meet for no logical reason I can give. I asked for an egregious extension on one of my projects today, and my other professor granted it with the warning that there will not be a repeat of this extension for future projects and that I will have to be more responsible for my time management in the future — I’ve been sort of spiraling ever since that deserved email.

I attempted suicide again ,but this time I got hospitalized by my schools mental health center. I was there for two weeks and I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

My mom wanted me safe at home, they even got me a care during my semester off. My mom said “I want you to have this car so you do not feel like you have to do online school.

I'm 25 years old and I've decided to go back to school. Long story short, I didnt do well in high school. At all. My mom had stage 4 kidney disease and my sister was depressed/suicidal, both of these things occurred the minute I became a freshman and lasted well into my early 20's. I put school off after I graduated to take care of my mom and forgot about myself up until recently. I have a GPA of 2.0 and my grades were abysmal. Despite how bad that looks, I'm actually a good student, which makes my high school transcript all the more painful to look at.

I'm a second semester dual enrollment student (meaning I'm still technically in highschool but taking all my classes on a college campus) and I'm MISERABLE.

I feel so suicidal when I get to class and want to do nothing but curl up in bed and forget about all of my classes. It feels like too much and I feel so lonely here even though I have friends.

Quick background: I (f18) am looking for some advice as no one in my family can really relate to my current situation.\\n\\nI want to take 18 credits my first semester. I would have a (in my opinion) doable schedule AROUND the classes (free time, breaks, etc), but I\\'m wondering if I\\'ll be killing myself in the actual academic sense. I\\'m a gifted student and I do take school seriously. I usually get good grades but honestly after Covid they started to slip a little (A/B\\'s with an occasional C). I also just went through a very traumatic event in March (my friend passed by suicide). The circumstances lead to me being a little... sluggish through school to say the least. However, I really want to take college seriously and do well, both in my classes and in my life with the grieving process and my own personal mental health issues.\\n\\nThat brings me to the real question here. I am very ambitious (mostly ill-advised ambition because I\\'m me, lol), and I want to take 18 credits for my upcoming first fall semester. The classes are:\\n\\n\\\\-Language Course Level 1 (I\\'m already proficient, been studying this language for 5 years)\\n\\n\\\\-**Biology Level 1** (with 2 hr Lab once a week)\\n\\n\\\\-**Math Course** (my worst subject)\\n\\n\\\\-Honors College English Level 1 (usually a cakewalk for me)\\n\\n\\\\-First-Year Seminar\\n\\n\\\\-Major-Related Gen Ed. (about food production/sustainability)\\n\\nI know this is a general question, but does this sound like too much? Does anyone have experience taking this many credits, positive or negative, that they could share? Especially as a freshman? \\n\\nI think that I\\'ll be fine because of the ratio of difficult to easy courses, but I have a reputation of saying \"yeah I\\'m fine and I can totally balance everything,\" and then breaking down months in. I want to set myself up for success, but also I really want to take all of these classes. Thanks in advance!\\n\\nTLDR; I want to take 18 credits/6 classes, but I\\'m only really worried about **2 of them being hard**. I haven\\'t had the best track record with school because of some past events/mental health stuff. Is it a bad idea for my first semester?', 'What should I do during my gap year in the middle of college? Unfortunately, my request for advice is a little unrealistic. \\n\\nTW: suicide attempt\\n\\nTo make a very long story short, I tried to end it. I went home to treat my mental health, taking a gap year. I’m saying this because I feel like I need to justify the conditions of my request, and explain why I’m requesting it, or I’ll be seen as lazy and spoiled.\\n\\nI’m looking for low-stress things to do, hopefully things that are good for my school career and after, to do. To make matters worse, anything paid won’t work (immigration restrictions). I’m doing something called Google Career certificates on Coursera. Probably wasting time and money, but I need something productive and concrete to do and it feels nice making progress on it. I’m pretty much open to anything that fits the conditions, but I know I’m asking for too much and am being way too idealistic.', \"I no longer enjoy my major (graphic design) TW: mental health, suicide \\n\\nI was undecided for the first 1.5 years of college, just taking classes to fulfill gen eds and see what I liked. I ended up honing in on graphic design after seriously thinking about it. I enjoyed a few projects that I've done in graphic design classes, but I feel a strong aversion to it now. I don't ever want to touch the programs again (Adobe CS) or design/illustrate ever again. \\n\\nTo give some context, the last few semesters of college have been a disaster. Due to declines in mental health, I stop going to class and give up on the work completely. I had to take three incompletes one semester and failed one class, which I have since retaken and passed. This summer, I took one class (JUST ONE!) and began to stop showing up to class and struggled with my work. I worked closely with the professor and just barely passed the class. Since the class ended (a few weeks ago), I haven't drawn/illustrated, played around with Photoshop/illustrator, nor do I want to. My dad just mentioned to me that he wanted me to mess around with something in Photoshop for him and I felt so upset and uncomfortable at the idea of it.\\n\\nI know many people will probably tell me that I can switch majors and do something I actually enjoy. Well, I can't. My scholarship runs out soon (I have two semesters left with it) and my parents pay what the scholarship doesn't cover. I also don't really enjoy... anything. After a suicide scare with me, my dad told me that college was not worth my life and I didn't have to go back if I didn't want to. I don't want to. But I also don't want to be stuck working a dead end job for the rest of my life. \\n\\nI am getting help in therapy and I'm on medication. I don't know what else I can do. Maybe the answer is just to suck it up and deal with it. But since every semester for the last couple of years has ended in me wanting to die and giving up on schoolwork/going to class, I don't see any success from that. And say I do graduate with my degree eventually. I'll be stuck doing something I don't enjoy and even dread for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nI'm at such a low point. I just... Don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has gone through something similar or has any advice or anything, I'd really appreciate it.\", \"Do colleges actually take note about mental health and personal scheduling, or did they make that up to make me feel better TW: I'm talking about some personal mental health stuff including self harm and suicidal tendencies\\n\\n\\nSo I technically failed my first two classes I ever took at my community college- I was actually doing great until I almost committed suicide... twice, and had to be sent to the psychiatric ward. I just decided to fail instead of drop the class for a long story about financial aid and ex I'm too lazy to tell at the time. I also work 15-20hrs a week and have a 45min bus commute every single morning along with a nasty depression/anxiety/CPTSD/sleep issues/heavily suspected ADHD combo.\\n\\n\\nI retook the classes obviously and I got a 3.26GPA overall, and while there was no actual recorded suicide attempt or psychiatric ward I do still suffer deeply from mental illness. I want to bring my grades up and get on the honor role if I can, but I don't know if it's mentally possible for me. The college I'm looking at is just a small satellite of a larger, average 2.5GPA minimum university [how dastardly, what a simpleton, I know]. They (my community college) keep telling me I'll be fine to transfer and that as long as I can explain they won't judge too harshly, but I think they're telling me that to make me feel better.\", \"Am I the only person that is actually thriving right now taking online classes?

After a long talk with my psychiatrist, I've decided to go back to college. I quit school when I was in 6th grade after a suicide attempt due to severe bullying so I never went to highschool. I got my GED when I was 17 and later in life got an associates degree at the local CC. I originally wanted to get into nursing but was talked out of it and I regret every second I didn't go because I have never been able to get a job in the field I studied for. The advisors said I'd never make it in nursing because of my low math scores. I basically taught myself math since quitting school in 6th grade so it is quite below average. I'm good at studying so I know if I apply myself, I can pass the math classes with AT LEAST a C, which is required for the degree I'm thinking about pursuing.

I have been putting off turning in the application because I don't know that my reasoning is valid and/or how to actually write about it. \\n\\nI have struggled with poor mental health for years (likely since high school). My freshman year was essentially a year of mania. I failed out the first semester of my sophomore year, the time during which I went through my first suicide attempt. Unfortunately, I do not have documentation of this, aside from my family who found my location mid-attempt and a few colleagues that were with me because I felt guilty about trying to kill myself and not going to work, so I went to work and then carried on afterward. By no documentation, I mean that there is no hospital stay/therapy/etc. \\n\\nI went back to school about a year after failing out at our local community college and had did slightly better. Unfortunately, I had some colleagues that suggested I go see my doctor about going on medication and so I did-- went on Zoloft and quickly had another suicide attempt. This time around, my family called the police and I was taken to the hospital in-patient, so I do have documentation. Was put on Latuda following my in-patent treatment, which is a medication for Bipolar Depression. While I don't have an official diagnosis (I don't think), the medication worked well and was given due to the fact that most bipolar people have poor reactions to Zoloft. \\n\\nAll that to say, how do I approach the appeal with little documentation (around the time that I failed out)?

I destroyed my body and mind to get through school and it’s done nothing for me but traumatize me. \\n\\nI had issues with depression and anxiety before school but it just made everything so much worse.

I also have commitment issues so I didn’t feel like I could switch schools. \\n\\nI became extremely, extremely isolated. I would go weeks without talking to anyone except for an older lady who would check me into the cafeteria. I didn’t have a car the first two years so I couldn’t really go home, I was just stuck up there except for thanksgiving and winter breaks. I was too mentally to work so I didn’t have any extra money. Also, I didn’t understand how my meal plan worked so I was just eating 1 meal a day for a long time. \\n\\nI became extremely depressed, anxiety skyrocketed to the point of daily panic attacks, touch starved, and suicidal.

Certain smells or things would also take me back. Even driving through the city the college is in I break out in a cold sweat.

I've tried to get treatment but it really doesn't do much. I've never been depressed, though, and this situation is the first time I've ever felt suicidal. I've had shitty living conditions before, but nothing this hostile.\\n\\nMy dorm is medium sized, only housing around 80 people. As a result, we have a dorm group chat to discuss any situation that arises. There's been a lot of issues with cleanliness, but honestly those don't bother me very much. It's not so much that the people in the chat are unreasonable, because everyone deserves to be able to live their life without facing constant interruptions and noises. No, its more that the dorm itself isn't conductive to living with other people. Its one of those buildings where a mouse on the third floor sounds like an elephant in the second. Between that and a lot of other issues, the people in the chat have gotten really agressive, which again, I get. Still, everything is an issue. A single strand of hair in the sink turns into a thirty minute argument. Theres constant bickering over quiet hours. Walking around late at night gets you yelled at. Throwing away hair in the trash but not covering it up is gross, stuff like that. \\n\\nI've also gotten a noise complaint from my roomate for listening to music with my earphones, even though it was at less than half the volume. I hear her wake up and sigh every time I walk in at night to get my stuff to shower. I'm really trying my best to be quiet, but I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and have bad night vision, so I know I'm being way louder than is reasonable. I know I'm a terrible roomate, which is part of the reason I tried getting a single room this year.\\n\\nAnd the chat is a constant reminder that I'm really not fit to live in shared accomodations. I've only fucked up once or twice, but its a constant reminder that my continued existence in the dorm is a bad thing for the people around me. I'm  scared to breathe too loud when I hide in the bathroom because I feel like they'll hear me and they'll hate me. I recognize that this isn't a healthy thinking pattern, but after I absentmindedly made some noise yesterday night in the shower and got told off for it, I started to actually contemplate suicide for the first time in my life. I feel like a burden of everyone, and like an impediment to their ability to enjoy their dorm life. I feel like I'm too loud and too weird to derve to be here. I know I don't deserve to live here, because if I was a good dormmate I wouldn't have to constantly remind myself that I'm not allowed to make noise and that I can't talk or pace or make my weird little mouth noises that I make when I'm exited. I know when I'm happy I'm too loud, so I don't deserve to be happy is it's impacting everyone elses ability to be happy.\\n\\nIt feels like I'm trapped in solitary confinement at the panopticon, where I'm surronded by people that are always watching my every move and want me dead. I'm alone here, except I'm  never alone, because I can't even cry when I hide in the bathroom because it's too loud and I'm afraid of getting yelled at. Everywhere I feel eyes on me, like people are maliciously trying to get me to mess up so they can punish me. I feel like I'm under constant survellaince until they find out how weird I am and that I'm an impostor and a predator and deserve to die. I know this is irrational becausr no one cares that much about me anyways, but I can't continue on like this. I just want to die.\\n\\nAnyways, I know there's not really a solution. Residential Services are trying to move me to a different dorm, but I don't think that will help much. I'm still going to be intruding on my roomates life. I'm still going to have to constantly remind myself that my happiness is actively damaging to the people around me. There's a severe housing shortage, to the point that there's not even emergency accomodations available. I know Im not going to get a single. I can't sleep because people are watching. I can't cry or I'm a bad person. I'm already hogging up the bathroom too much because I lock myself in there all night so I can hide from how awful I am at not making my roomate's sleep miserable. I know this isn't rational, but my brain knows it to be true. I feel like my only two options are to die or drop out of college. I'm not cut out for this like how normal people are, so it feels like it's a better choice to just give up instead of putting a burden on people.\", \"Is It Worth It To Tell A Professor My Personal Circumstances Since I Failed?

Hello everyone. I'm currently a freshman finishing his 2 semesters in a Local CC in California. I'm not sure what's been happening but recently I'm just been too depressed and not motivated to even do anything in life. I have often been crying and hardly feel like eating. I'm 18m who attending a community college for a degree in culinary but I'm starting to think that culinary isn't my thing. I've been thinking of switching my major but I just don't know whether I should and what I should switch it to. My mother takes care of me and my other 4 siblings. \\n\\nMy family's financial situation is not great at all. my older brother is the only person with a full-time job as well as my mom. They pay him 15/hr and I'm not sure about my mother's pay. I am not even sure why I attended CC in the first place now. I don't know what to do, I have good grades for now but I'm just lost. I just want to repay my mother for everything she has done for me and my family but my health isn't helping me. \\n\\nI have been having suicidal thoughts and often stay in the restroom and cry. I only have one week of college before this semester ends but I plan to make an in-person appointment with a psychologist or counselor that my CC offers and talk about this stuff as well but I'm not sure if I should tell them all this. I'm very close to dropping out and taking a job but I'm afraid I'll regret it and disappoint my family. I'm sorry for this again but I'm just lost.

Is it worth ending?\", 'Would it be dumb to take out unnecessary student loans? Let me explain my situation:\\n\\n\\nI am attending a community college, I am a rising sophomore trying to eventually earn a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. So far I have 0 student loans. What\\'s more, my tuition is so low that I usually get paid around $8,000/year to attend college. Next year I will be transferring to a University were my entire tuition will be covered [the school has a grant for students whose families earn less than x amount, the grant covers all of my tuition]. This means I will be graduating completely debt free and with a good degree from a good school.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy issue:\\n\\n\\nI have mental health problems. If I am too stressed it will trigger an \"episode\" which will cause me to make rash decisions, become depressed and suicidal, delusional, have hallucinations, become manic, etc. But when my stress levels are not too high and I take my medication I can live a normal life. The issue is that because I don\\'t have a family I have to work while going to school. The stress of working 30hrs/week + taking 3 classes a semester may be too much for me. I have talked to my therapist and she said I should decrease either the number of classes I\\'m taking or the number of hours I work. If I decrease the number of classes I am taking then I won\\'t be able to transfer on time, and if I decrease the number of hours I\\'m working I won\\'t be able to pay rent and the rest of my bills. However, I could decrease the number of hours worked if I were to take out a $5,000 subsidized loan with 1% interest that doesn\\'t start accumulating until I\\'m done with school.\\n\\n\\n\\nShould I take out a loan? Or should I just take 1 or 2 classes a semester instead?', 'What’s the worst professor you’ve ever had? What’s the best? What did they do to make them the best or worst?\\n\\n**edit:** I have another HORRIBLE professor story I wanted to add in.  I was taking a probability class over summer last year and also working on campus.  I ended up reporting my boss for sexual harassment and my department did an investigation and found enough stuff on his PC to warrant him being immediately fired and banned from campus.  The same day they fired him, he was found dead by suicide.  I had a lot of issues handling this, emotionally, and the Dean of Students and campus counseling came to my aid to support me through it.  I was very grateful towards them.  The same week this happened, I had a midterm in my probability class.  The dean personally spoke to my teacher to ask him to be mindful of my circumstances and give me extra time to prepare for the test and to take it later in the week.  He refused, told me to not be lazy and to \"hire a tutor if the class is so hard for you\" and gave me a list of tutors starting off at $50/hr.  I didn\\'t need help studying, I just needed more time and considering I quit my job after what happened, I definitely didn\\'t have $50/hr to throw at anyone anyway..... I ended up getting a C+ in the class and therapy, no thanks to how much of an asshole the teacher was.  I\\'ve since told all my fellow math students to not take any classes from him because he has no sympathy for students and he wasn\\'t even a good teacher to begin with.\\n\\n**worst**: I took a CS - based discrete math course, and the teacher for that was the fucking worst. It was a large class (auditorium-sizes class), and so the teacher had a teaching assistant. It became pretty clear early on that she had no like or respect for students and I’m pretty sure she was only teaching because she had to, but she was more interested in her research work. She often rushed lecture, she refused to slow down for anyone that asked (and would openly mock them for asking), and she was very unforgiving with grades. As in, if a problem was a multi-parter with parts (a) to (d) and you partially got (c) incorrect, the entire problem would be marked zero.  At the first midterm, she started the test by saying she put some common mathematic formulas on the back of the exams for “all the morons in the room who never bothered to learn basic math”. I left that test, reported her to the CS department, and dropped the class. \\n\\n**best**: On the flip side, the next semester, I took a math-based discrete math course from a strict but very fair mathematician who was very knowledgeable and had a good way to help students understand difficult concepts in more basic terms. I had to work my ass off in that class, but I learned so much and I really respect the teacher.\\n\\nI ended up switching majors from cs to math/stats, partially as a result of these two teachers.', 'What are your experiences going to a campus counselor/therapist or using any other campus mental health resource?

It was a private university so my parent throw away so much money and the guilt was killing me.\\nThen I decided that maybe It would be better for me to study to be a teacher. I enrolled myself in a new university that is public so its free. I've been trying to make it work here for 2 years and again I'm only anxious and sad all the time.\\nI really can't see myself actually being a teacher. It scares me so much to be in front of that many children and being responsible of their well being. I always try to calm myself thinking that maybe I can be a private teacher like the ones I grew up going to but I don't know if I like that idea either.\\nBoth my psychologist and psychiatrist have told me that maybe university isn't for me but I can't see that as an option. One of my professors also told me that i should not suffer this much during my academic journey. \\nAlso I know my dad would be so disappointed because, If I drop out, that means his 3 children have tried and have dropped out. \\nAlso, It scares me the idea of regretting it in the future. I have heard a lot of people saying how they regret not getting a degree when they had the opportunity. At the same time I know that I can study later on in my life. A lot of my classmates are older than me and are already married and have kids. Their ages go from 18 to 40 years old.\\nFor a while I lost my academic confidence after failing some classes.I try to study but it so hard to find the will to do it.  When I did well on an exam this year I started crying out of happiness. I know I have the capability academically but I don't know if I have it mentally. I have always been a student. It scares me the idea of not being one anymore.\\nMaybe I could just enroll myself in only two subjects to reduce the stress and have more time to work but I don't know. I have been trying to make university work for me since 2017. \\n\\n Should I keep trying?\", 'Confronted with Mortality I don’t know if the rest of you feel this, but high-school of course is a sort of bubble and college is a transition out, and an unexpected part of that transition is death.

Yesterday one of our seniors in our college lived off campus and got robbed and murdered not even half a mile away from me.

I went to community college and got an associate and was on the president\\'s list. But once I started my 4 year college, everything went downhill. I actually started studying harder and going to all my classes. But semester after semester, I would fail. And I ended up repeating the same class 4 different times and multiple major courses for my degree had to be retaken. I got academically dismissed twice and now I can\\'t reenroll for a semester.

Someone please tell me what I can do to tell my school that I am getting help for my mental health and that I want to be given a third chance. Also I should mention that I literally had a professor who would sneer at me cause I would score low but his handwriting his terrible, he goes off topic, and rarely tests us on what we actually learned. I had to retake his class three times and every semester his treatment towards me got worse. Eventually he would just glare at me and call on me knowing that I would stutter and not be able to answer and then shake his head, I was humiliated. I am getting no financial help from my family, actually my mom disowned me cause I didn\\'t talk to her properly on new years (she\\'s a whole other world of issue). So I literally have no one to rely on. So if there is anyone out there who went through what I am going through or is someone who is knowledgeable in this, please tell me what I can do.

When starting college, I struggled a lot, and the past year was the only really good year of college that I had in a decent mental state. It has been a journey, but I am here. I have an in demand degree (Applied Mathematics/Data Analytics) and also picked up three minors in biology, chemistry, and biostatistics. I have a very high GPA (3.85), as I was planning for a while to attend medical school or grad school if that did not pan out. Now, I am thinking about working in industry for a little bit doing something else before I go onto further education due to financial circumstances. \\n\\nBeing that I wanted to go to med school (I decided this during my junior year, so kind of late), I focused A LOT on my grades. I took a research fellowship (was told they were just as good, especially for STEM majors) the last two summers instead of internships because that felt more practical for where I was going. I have three poster presentations (2 at national conferences) and my first paper is in review to get published right now. I'm worried that because of this, I will be limited in the job search because I did research instead of internships. I have had a myriad of other jobs during college including being a full-time nanny, tutor, orientation leader, and teaching assistant for a chem lab. I also have a bunch of different volunteer experiences, including working for a suicide line once a week for the last year. I did a summer internship in high school through my community, and they liked me so much that they kept me on during the school year and summers for three years. I'm not sure I can list that as relevant anymore, though. It also doesn't necessarily pertain to STEM at all. I've got a LinkedIn with a few hundred connections, my family has additional connections in several fields, and every professor I have ever had has liked me. So, I am hoping I can use that as an advantage (also that I went to a smaller school and was able to build real relationships with my professors easier). \\n\\nAre there any people who have been in this situation and still found luck? Any advice? I am just worried that I may have screwed myself a little bit because my plan isn't going exactly as I laid it out initially.

I actually met this one guy who happened to be in a few of my classes--we were partners for the icebreaker on the first day and chatted it up a bit.

As said in the title, I’ve felt very Depressed lately that I didn’t get the college experience that I wanted. It’s a long story:\\n\\nThings got off to a good start when I got invited to a pickup volleyball game the day I moved into the dorms (My University makes you stay in them during your first year). But things went downhill quickly after that. The roommates I were placed with throughout my first year were horrible. They had no manners, they left me to clean up their messes, and would stay up well into the night, keeping me from getting some sleep. Sometimes, I would drive back to my parents’ house during the night because I couldn’t take their antics.  When I got classed as a Sophomore, I sadly decided to return home and commute to school instead. As anyone who went to school this way knows, commuting greatly reduces your opportunities to socialize with your peers. The next couple of years were spent dealing with depression. By the time I wanted to come out of my shell again, Covid hit, which forced me back into isolation. Now that I’m a Senior, I’ve tried to reach out and talk with people again as a last-ditch effort to salvage this disaster. But students seem to be more closed-off than ever, probably due to experiencing the Covid lockdowns as teenagers. \\n\\nMany people remember college as the best phase of their lives, but for me, it’ll be remembered as my worst.', \"Graduation Depression For some background, I am graduating from my undergrad in about a week. My last final in a few days and I am finishing what is supposed to be my greatest accomplishment of my life. \\n\\nThis is the end of my structured life, no more boxes left to check.

I have spent the past 4 years working toward a degree in finance, and now I have no more school and will be on a job search for the next few weeks. Every plan or idea of what I wanted is now being questioned. \\n\\nNo more studying, no more deadlines and no more stress, right? \\n\\nIt feels as if I don't know who I am which is strange because I was so sure, but now it is time to actually structure my life and I am at a loss.

I just wanted to post on here to see if anyone else was feeling this way or if anyone had any advice. I just graduated from college a few months ago with honors in 2 majors (not to brag, but it might add more to my point), but I moved back home and I\\'ve just been feeling horrible. It\\'s not about my parents or anything, they\\'re awesome and super supportive of me, it\\'s just having to be in this position again.\\n\\nWhile I was in college, I was working 2 jobs at a time, paying my own rent, living with roommates who ended up being my best friends, and all at the same time having fun with my friends. I finally felt a sense of independence and FREEDOM (not in like the rebellious college kid type of way, but it just felt like I had purpose with my life).\\n\\nWhen I graduated, it kinda just felt like *nothing* almost. I mean, sure, I was proud and everything, but at that point I was still in denial that I had to move and abandon all of this. I never really got to sit down and process all that I did, all the people I inspired and even the awesome courses I ended up taking. I got so many cool awards too that I never even thought twice about because I was doing so much at the same time.\\n\\nNow all my friends ended up moving to LA. I wanted to go so bad, but truth is I don\\'t have enough money saved up to even do it. I miss them so much though, I feel like they were the people that kept me going. I supported them and vice versa, and now they\\'re gone. Right now, I\\'m just cooped up in my room 24/7 when I\\'m not working, and my life kinda feels pointless. I\\'m 22, and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but it\\'s just hard to see that when I\\'m not doing what I want to do.\\n\\nMy parents recommend me waiting until I get a job to move to LA, and they want me to stay home until I do so. I didn\\'t want to do that at first, mostly because it just feels like I\\'m a \"loser\" especially after just having an apartment I was paying for. And the job market fucking SUCKSSSSS so that just makes it even worse. I tried to give myself until November to find something, but day after day I\\'m realizing it\\'s just unrealistic and that makes me more depressed.\\n\\nI think the worst part about this is that I keep comparing myself to people. Like my best friend of 10 years lives nearby me, but he has a job he loves and a gf and he lives with his parents (we graduated at the same time). I just keep putting myself in this hole because I don\\'t have it all figured out, and I wanted to be around people that were in my position but being away makes me feel so much more alone. I don\\'t even have it in me to visit them bc it would make me miss them more. I don\\'t want this to be forever, but everyday it just feels like that.\\n\\nMy parents are so proud of me and remind me of it almost everyday, but I just don\\'t feel that same sense of pride yet, and I don\\'t think I will until I\\'m on my own.

Plus they wouldn\\'t believe me anyways as in person I make an effort to act confidently and as if though everything is \"figured out\".\\n\\nIn any case, here\\'s the situation. I\\'m a first year at UCSD and I\\'m studying computer science and violin performance. I have an active passion for both programming and classical music performance so by all means these modes of study were the right choice. From the surface it would seem that I have the puzzle pieces to be having a blast here, that was always the goal. Academically and musically its been fine, I study a lot, I do well in my assignments and exams, I practice daily, and I participate in two orchestras here. Progress has been going well, I\\'m actively engaged, and the people I\\'ve met so far have been been great. So by all means it should be that my time here should be by every means enjoyed. Yet it\\'s been anything but.\\n\\nEver since high school ended I\\'ve felt like I\\'ve been in a limbo. As expected all of my close friends and I went our separate ways, I\\'m in a long distance relationship, and frankly it\\'s going horribly, but I hold on to the possibility that things will get better. In general life has definitely jumped into unfamiliar territory. Possibly as a result of all that I just feel empty, and over the past couple of weeks that \"empty\" feeling converted itself into pain. It always feels like something is \"missing\" but I can\\'t for the life of me figure out what that is. My days consist of studying, practicing, and club meetings when applicable, and I keep myself busy, yet I feel hollow. After everything is done, when I get back to my dorm, I pass the time by playing games or reading, or watching anime, and I feel absolutely nothing. It\\'s gotten to the point where I cant sleep and I\\'m on the verge of having severe mental breakdowns at 2 AM.\\n\\nA big part of it is just feeling disconnected from the world and just being lonely. I don\\'t have friends, and I\\'ve tried to amend that by joining clubs but all it is is small talk. So far I\\'ve failed to really \"click\" with anyone so I end up spending anytime outside of clubs completely alone, which stings extra when I see people on campus doing work or just hanging out with their \"group\" so to speak. The loneliness after a while starts to hurt a lot and it\\'s convinced me that maybe its me that is the problem, \"maybe people just don\\'t get along with me\" I tend to think. With that being said at the same time I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing wrong either, I\\'m very respectful and outgoing, and I can hold a conversation, but I can\\'t for the life of me make a genuine friend, it\\'s just the typical \"colleague\" type relationships. Everyone seems to have their cliques already but as of now I find that I don\\'t have one of my own. I\\'ve always been extroverted and love being around people I care about, so just having nobody to talk to or be myself around is something I find unbearable, I hate being alone with my thoughts as it eventually turns those thoughts into something negative.\\n\\nI think possibly another big part maybe how I spend my days, but I can\\'t really be certain. Even though I love my field of study, the workload feels very taxing sometimes and practicing violin has its own set of challenges as well. It takes up nearly all my time, If I\\'m not studying, I\\'m practicing, and if I\\'m not practicing, I\\'m studying, with the only exceptions being late at night and at club meetings. It\\'s a constant state of business and I feel like that\\'s all my life has become, the only other activities involve club meetings where I fail to make actual friends or be part of a close circle and alone time in my dorm where I try to feel something by doing hobbies (gaming, anime, books, etc) only to still feel miserable.\\n\\nDealing with the above for a few months now has led me to lose a lot of my conviction that I may have had before as a highschooler. I feel like an empty husk, and any happiness I had in high school is drifting away. I feel alone and depressed everyday now which is very unlike me, my friends in high school knew me as an optimist. and that painful feeling just keeps growing inside me everyday because I feel like nothing I do alleviates it, the world doesn\\'t feel like the place to be and thrive anymore like it used to. I go back to my dorm everyday feeling deflated and awful, and it gets worse and I\\'m at a loss of solutions, and seeing so many people around me have the time of their lives just makes the feeling worse, as it leads me to question what exactly am I doing wrong. As of today I\\'m nearing a breaking point and I wanted some advice from those wiser than me. I contemplated doing horrible things to myself while in the shower but I talked myself out of it and I realized something needs to change. I understand the cause of this feeling isn\\'t really clear but the fact remains that it is, and I don\\'t know why. College is supposed to be an evolving experience that starts my career and the life in the real world, and I can\\'t do that if I continue to feel bitter for seemingly no reason.', 'I have my finals coming up soon & I’m unable to focus because of depression I used to normally follow the pomodoro technique for studying but now i cant do even that.

I don't suck at math completely, but it never was my strong side. I studied above average in school, got very high grades from subjects like english/history/geography etc.\\nFor the math test you can get anything from 100 to 200 points. The motivational letters are evaluated if some students have same amount points. \\nSo, I passed test for 166 points. It is low score.

The worst thing you should pay for 4 years of studying immediately. So you don't have a chance to get your money back even if you will be redirected on government-paid study form. And also you can't get scholarship on a paid form. So theoretically it is possible to study really good, that some student on government form will study really bad, and you will take his place, and then if you will be high in rating you can get scholarship. But it is practically impossible. So I don't have a chance to get any money.\\nAgain, the problem is I just feel so guilty. I might've feel better if It was possible to get you money back if you will study good enough, and to be at at least government - paid studying wihout scholarship. But it is impossible now.

So here I met many people. Everyone here is on government paid form. And the thing is... I don't want to say bad things but they are stupid. Much worse then me. They don't know any subjects. In fact, they ask me to help them or to write something from my copybook everyday because they don't study at all. They just vape, drink all the time. And they passed the exams, they don't pay, and majority of them even has scholarship.\\nI don't know how they got it. I understand envy  is bad. But I can't do anything about it. I just feel so fucking bad. I study and get very good grades now, even on math. But actually it feels even worse then getting bad ones, because I understand it's pointless. I can't do anything. I can't make anything so my parents will get theur money back and I can't stand the fact stupid people who drink alcohol and vape all the day have fucking scholarship. I think about this all the time. I talked about it with my parents, they said that I shouldn't worry, because main thing is knowledge and I will get and they won't, even if they havw scholarship, it won't help them in the future.

I haven't experienced any head-related injuries that may have caused this (as far as I know) but I would like to note that I have been dealing with symptoms of depression and have been diagnosed with ADHD.

I also was super homesick when I first came to college (whenever I talked it felt like there was a knot in my throat and I sounded like I was about to cry), so I wasn't really in the mood to make friends with people that I would like and get along with on my floor. After a few days, I made some friends with some kids on my floor and we met some other kids from our building, and they're still pretty much the only friends I have, but I don't really feel like I'd call them true friends.\\n\\nThey're nice and I will talk to them, but I am just so much different than most of them. Most of them don't go out on the weekends and spend all week doing homework and spend the weekends just sitting in our dorm building and watching movies and stuff. I also don't really feel comfortable around any of them besides maybe 2 kids. Most of them are either kind of weird or super innocent, so I can't really joke around with them like I could with my friends at home. It's sort of hard to explain, but with most of them it feels like we're still at that stage where you just met someone and are still trying to be super polite. We've yet to reach the point of what I consider real friendship where you feel comfortable teasing each other and just messing around in general.\\n\\nAnyway, it feels super lonely basically having no one to actually talk to. We'll talk, but it's always about stuff like classes and feels so formal and polite. Even though it technically is social, it doesn't feel much different then just sitting in my room all day talking to no one. Everyone seems to enjoy college (at least the social aspect of it), but I'm not happy here at all. I know that I won't be happy without meeting new friends that I really am friends with like mine from home, but I don't know how to do that. I go to a pretty big state school, and I'm in a few clubs, but I never hang out with kids from those clubs that I've met. I also haven't really met anyone from my classes. We haven't done any group projects in any of my classes, so it's not common to start talking to people in class.\\n\\nAll of this has been making me feel sort of depressed. I rarely enjoy anything here now. I guess the only time I'm really having fun is on the weekend going out, which can be fun, but basically from Sunday through Thursday I am miserable. And going out on the weekends and drinking is fun in its own rite, but it's not the same as having friends that I have fun with and actually enjoy being around.\\n\\nIf anyone has any advice, I'd really appreciate it.\", 'calling fellow depressed students how did you get into your dream school being depressed? what steps helped you, specifically. sometimes it’s hard to see that far into the future. just hoping to see any inspiring stories for motivation.', \"College depression and anxiety I [20/F] now know I am depressed.

They criticize me for not being more on top of things (admittedly, I could have been much better about communicating with professors during this time, but given the circumstances I\\'m trying not to come down too hard on myself for it), question why I need the help that I do (e.g. \"What stopped you from completing this assignment?\" when I had explained that I was on the floor having a panic attack right before I needed to turn it in), and have told me on multiple occasions that I am \"lucky\" to receive one of my documented accommodations from professors. They also sometimes say they will reach out or have reached out to professors, and then I follow up with the professor about it and they have not, and it takes multiple emails/phone calls/visits/etc. over the course of weeks to get them to finally reach out. In the past, I have opted to advocate for myself with professors and only reach out to the disabilities office when absolutely necessary due to these reasons.

There are two of these bigger assignments that are my main concern here. One is a short philosophy essay that was due three weeks ago. I got an extension on it, which was already awkward because I ended up having to ask for it the night of the deadline due to a massive, unexpected panic attack, but the extended deadline came and went. I tried going to my professor\\'s office hours last week to explain the situation with the expectation that another extension would probably not be possible at this point, but he didn\\'t show up. I\\'m wondering if I should email him, but then I would not be able to explain the nuance of things as well.

It\\'s only a week late at this point and I have it almost completed, but my professor for this class is really strict about turning assignments in on time and rarely accepts late work. I should have asked for an extension on this one, but I was worried about the fact that I was supposed to be working on this every week and had nothing to turn in.\\n\\nHow should I approach reaching out to those two professors?

I also feel a lot of pressure from other hard things I need to do soon( check my financial aid, go to campus for health check, call the disability office, and literally try to clean up my “depression mess”, etc.,) \\n\\nWould it be unfair/inappropriate to try to email my professor and ask for a “restart/break” this week? Like maybe I could be exempted from everything/or just the discussion or something? Should I just “take the hit” and accept that I probably won’t get that class stuff done without really stressing myself out even more while I feel like shit, so just not do any of it (and not mention it) and try to do better next week? Should I email her and say I haven’t been able to get any of that stuff done, but I will try harder next week and accept the impact on my grade? Other than the lecture videos I have no idea what she’s like and if she would be accepting, or really strict, etc,. Usually I can just function and just get things done no matter what, but I don’t know if I can push my luck enough to do that this time—just so burnt out and getting behind in everything. \\n\\nThank you for reading or any advice, I hope it’s not too “specific” and hard to answer.', 'Coping with depression in college?

I have worked so hard to get to where I am... or was rather. Over the last 2 years my daughter (now 4 yo) has been sick with fevers almost constantly. Yet, I somehow remained afloat. I have ADHD and finally took advantage of student disability services. I do not have a learning disability, but sometimes my anxiety and depression get the best of me. However, Spring 2020 I was so excited knowing I only had a year left and would complete my bachelors in 3 years. Then, COVID. \\n\\nWhen we switched to online at spring break I had to juggle my course load and my children being home 24/7. I had a professor for two classes and who was kinda flakey herself. our schedules were colliding. She gave me extensions and had lengthy phone conversations, that often were personal, and I thought we had really great communication. Fast forward, she tells me she needs to think about how to handle it since she had NO recollection of speaking with me. So, she disappeared for a month without any contact. Finally, she emailed saying “I know how bad this looks that I have not been in contact...” basically said let’s go ahead and get your exams taken and acted like she had never accused me of not being in contact. She also over the semester sent multiple emails claiming to not have assignments I had completed and told me she did have assignments I had not completed. Clearly she was stressed or just confused. Then, she could not figure out how to upload them into our online system so she said that she would need to send me the exam essay questions and I would need to complete it and send it back by a certain time. I did that. Then the next day at the same time I was supposed to take the other exam... she went AWOL. I contacted the department after so many weeks of her disappearance. Mind you I was into summer semester and taking 5 classes, as I usually had done. \\n\\nBut, this was really weighing on me. I was stressed and this led to procrastination on my current semester. I ended up not completing a class, but was granted a withdrawal- there was a mistake and it was removed from my schedule and had to be re-enrolled. At that time I was already so stressed out over the 2 classes in limbo that my other classes were slipping so I had to work really hard to complete everything. The class that I had been re-enrolled in had a professor who was unwilling to give me any extension. So I received a W. I was okay with it, as I accepted responsibility. However, I still had those two previous classes hanging over my head... waiting for the chair to get back to me. Finally, I was in contact with someone who told me the professor reported that I turned in only 20% of the assignments. I responded that it wasn’t true and I had emails etc... the department faculty member basically told me that I should have addressed it sooner... Which I had. I contacted the department a month or more before I was in contact with her. So then she responds “go ahead and send whatever proof, but I feel that you did not handle this appropriately and the professor was more than accommodating.” Well, yes she was... but she was also confused and hard to get in touch with... blamed me... then took responsibility... then disappeared again. \\n\\nThis was rough on me, and I sadly became very unmotivated and depressed. So, I started fall semester out behind and avoiding the work. I got it together enough to communicate with all professors and was finally feeling okay, or so I thought. Then, I just hit a bottom. I lost hope and did not send everything to the faculty member, because I just felt belittled and embarrassed honestly. I also really liked the professor and hoped for a good letter of recommendation... obviously this was quite devastating. Meanwhile, I became extremely sick, probably from the depression... my daughters condition worsened and eventually we received a diagnosis for an auto-inflammatory disease... and a referral to an oncologist and rheumatologist. I tried to remain on track in my classes but eventually fell so far behind that I couldn’t physically or mentally even force myself to do the work. I even avoided contact with my professors. BIGGEST MISTAKE. Yet, here I am trying to finish up everything and hope the professors will understand and give me an Incomplete at least. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I still have not addressed the other two classes as I felt so overwhelmed with my current classes that I couldn’t even think about digging through all the emails and trying to put together a timeline. But at the same time the worry and stress caused me to shut down from the current as well. Then factor in e-learning with a kindergartner and a VERY sick pre-schooler. I was just in a complete dark hole of depression, anxiety, and stress. Here’s the really bad part... one of the classes is the very same class that I screwed up the semester before. Different professor though. \\n\\nSo, I guess, after all the ranting... I need advice. Should I plead my case to the professor and hope this time I can get an extension? I do have several medical excuses throughout the semester. Also, how should I explain to the department what took so long to follow up about the 2 classes? I feel like I should explain that I couldn’t allow it to cause any additional stress while trying to remain on track in the current semester... but I’m not sure that helps. And lastly, am I the only one that gets so overwhelmed and stressed that I completely shut down and avoid doing work or even communication. I know it was a horrible way to go about it... but mental health.. that’s all I can even say. I would sit down every night when I finally got my kids in bed and try to tell myself I had to focus... and just couldn’t. Then, instead of communicating I was embarrassed and just kept saying I’ll do it tomorrow and then send an email. I have time... until I had ZERO time left. Is this fixable? or should I consider it time to just bow out. If things do not work out is there someone at the college that could hear my story and help me fix it? I’m sure if I am unable to fix the situation not only will I be almost out of financial aid and more than likely be unable to stay in school for the additional semester I would need to fix this issue.

Starting when I was 14 I had some anger issues, usually throwing soft things (pillows, blankets, clothes etc.) at the wall when mad and talking back to my parents. They finally decided to let me go to a therapist (CBT) for my anger management/depression issues when I was 16. It has been no doubt helpful (and I rarely get angry like I used to and I never throw things anymore). After another serious bout of depression earlier this year (the first time I've been actively suicidal) I was able to start medication that has definitely helped tone down my emotional response.

Community was a little better for me because I was able to take other classes other than ones that related to my major, as well as work at a really fun job I had. I transferred to my University right when the pandemic hit, so for a year I was not forced to interact with others or become super involved in my majors' department. Last semester was my first semester on campus ,but only 30% of the school's population was there due to hybrid learning. My professors could tell I was not passionate about my work, but it did not bother me since not a lot was expected due to the campus climate. So far I have gotten on the deans list the first 3 semesters I have been at University because of how relaxed I felt. I could just hate my major and do my work in the comfort of my own home. About 3 days ago we returned on campus at full capacity. I was overwhelmed with how passionate everyone in my department seemed coming back. Like I said, I am not very involved in my department because I don't want to be, so I immediately felt out of place. Because I am not involved, passionate, or as loud as my classmates are, my professors now see right through me. I don't understand the work they assign me because I have no passion or interest to learn it. As hard as I try I cannot get interested in it like my classmates do. My professors speak to me in a condescending manner or like I'm an idiot when I ask questions. I'm starting to feel extremely isolated and insecure at school to the point where I want to drop out. I hate seeing my professor's faces everyday because I feel like they judge me for not being passionate. I don't blame them in a way, because they may feel like I am wasting their time. In a sense, I am because I am the one who chose this stupid major. I only feel like I cannot get out of it because 1. I am almost done 2. I am a first generation American, so my parents will be pissed if I don't graduate 3. It's too late to drop classes or switch my major. Long story short, I am becoming extremely depressed being back in person, only because I have to come face to face with my truth.

Friends and I have gone out and done activities but in the end it always steers back to him. We talk on the phone but it’s not exactly the same, it just makes me want to be in the same room. I cry every night. Out of nowhere. We’ve been dating for 9 months. We’ve talked about visits but he has fall ball soon and his weekends are pretty busy and his weekdays are hours of practice.

Calc 1 was never my strongest subject, but I somehow managed to get a B and the professor structured the class to essentially make it easy to follow along.

I've never felt suicidal more often in my life, it's been 2-3 days in a row. I'm not studying either, I can't, I don't know why, my brain's not in its panic mode. I'm also in a house with someone's fucking mom where I can't be free about myself anywhere except my room, so this just doubles in on my avoidant personality that I already have an issue of WITHOUT her existence.\\n\\nI've failed two courses but for some reason my brain's just accepted it as my fate. I mean I'm not scared anymore to fail. Failure is failure, you can take the course again next semester. For some reason I don't care about wasting money, about wasting my time, wasting effort, etc. It's like my brain's panic button is not there.

Im extremely annoyed because this wasn\\'t explained to us at all and also what fucking college class 2 credits? Even the  \"intro to college/cornerstone\" class everyone is forced to take was 3 credits.\\n\\nMy only two options at the moment are to pay for the classes 800 out of pocket OR to wait until next summer to take all 3 classes together because then it will be more than 6 credits and fafsa will pay for it in full. It just really sucks. I cant take any fall classes either because they have specific interning hours and schools are obviously closed and I cant take that one lonesome class either in the 2nd summer right now because it has a prerequisite.\\n\\nI thought about taking a random course outside my degree like intro to criminology or psychology but it honestly seems like more trouble than it\\'s worth and I will end up having to take 3 classes each both summers if I take an elective.

There were a lot of factors involved with it but it mostly had to do with a lot of things going on in my personal life, not being adequately prepared for my sophomore year while I was a freshman (a lot of material wasn’t covered at all and then I was expected to have it memorized), and my professors expected me to live, breathe, and bleed my profession. Not to mention I have ADHD and autism so it was hard to keep up. My professors were far from understanding of my situation and still expected me to put hundreds of dollars into projects that should be going to helping pay my mom’s medical bills (she had cancer and I felt horrible asking for money). Basically, I’m traumatized from my first attempt at college. \\n\\nMy boyfriend has encouraged me to go back, specifically for psychology, but I won’t. Not only is it absurd to go back at 24 years old, it’s also not worth the financial risk or sacrificing my mental health. My family won’t help me financially or emotionally since they think I should be spending my young life doing nothing but working to save for retirement. I also haven’t been able to find work in the field I majored in, so the risk of another few years being wasted is horrifying. \\n\\nSorry, I needed to rant.', 'I’m a junior living in a dorm alone. I wrote my suicide note last night. Advice needed. This isn’t a post seeking sympathy. It’s just to express that this past year of school has been overwhelming and I am no longer able to cope and seek help, I guess. I know there are many who feel the same way. Mental health services at my school are subpar. My professors are scattered and wild in their various methods of teaching. I already feel lost and behind and it’s what, the third week of school? I am struggling to see a point to all of this. I think the truth is that I haven’t seen one for a long time. \\n\\nI am in a dorm alone this semester, with a private bathroom and the looming threat (or saving grace) of a potential roommate. I don’t know how to talk about the suicidal thoughts I have been having without being sectioned or worse, pulled out of school. Although I guess that is kind of a stupid thought considering if I am dead I’ll be, for better or for worse, pulled out of school. \\n\\nI’ve vaguely talked to my sparse amount of friends about killing myself and as the gen z attitude goes, they thought I was joking. It’s not that I’m expecting a bunch of other college students to know what to do or say, but I’m just tired of reaching out at this point. Writing the note was blissful in the respect that I could finally say what I couldn’t in person. I don’t blame them for thinking it’s a joke. I tried hard to hide everything I was feeling last semester, but I don’t think I can anymore. \\n\\nTherapy through the school last semester did nothing but bring up unresolved trauma and encourage disordered eating. My therapist was a kind woman but had no clue what she was doing. I can’t go a single day without harming myself, again, another thing I can talk to no one about. I knew COVID was going to make things hard. I knew it was going to be isolating. But I return to this dorm every single day alone and I want to die. I’m getting a degree I don’t care about, doing research for my parents interests. The only reason I am alive right now is that I don’t want to hurt people and I don’t want to leave a mess, but this is steadily and sharply becoming less important to me. \\n\\nPeople who have been here, especially in regard to isolation and persistent depressive disorder, what the fuck do I do? How do I get better? How do I reach out about things like this, without fucking up everything and having everyone in my business at the same time?  If my parents found out, I wouldn’t be able to live it down. \\n\\nI’m meeting with a doctor today to discuss medication for PDD, GAD and PTSD, but there’s such a huge chance that it won’t work or it’ll make things worse. I am so tired of being alone and empty. If you have any advice at all, I could use it. About any of this stuff. \\n\\nTL;DR - I am depressed, suicidal, and isolated and I need help. But I don’t know how to bring this up with my school. I’ve tried therapy and I’m trying medication. I just need advice.', \"What do you resent your school for? my school had an incredibly challenging CS program, weed out classes yearly, it was strongly implied that even if you get through the impossible degree, that's *still not enough* because you have to get an internship every summer and go through 5 rounds of interviews and...\\n\\ni got incredibly depressed and suicidal. like high octane suicidal. because my school was grinding down my soul and toying with my future to the point where i had no respect for my body or life. \\n\\ni cannot stand when people masturbate over rigor. you can learn and be successful without things being artificially challenging, ***designed*** to make people fail.\", \"College is pushing me so far over the edge that I've been thinking of suicide.

All of this crazy mathematical stuff that someone with a sub 90 IQ could never hope to understand.  The only reason I'm passing is due to perfect attendance and the quizzes are open book team quizzes.  I feel like I'm a subhuman with no ambition, potential or motivation. I literally have no talent or abilities other then being able to do menial labor that pays me below 10 dollars per hour.  fuck college.  All it has done for me is destroy me internally and psycho rape me.  I dont feel like I've accomplished anything in my field of study and my parents try to delude me into thinking that I can be some sort of Temple Grandon type individual.

I know it’s a normal decision students always make but I just feel like venting about it for a moment.\\n\\nI’m not proud of it. I know it’s my fault for not keeping up with the homework and going to every TA discussion session. \\n\\nThe other classes I’m taking this semester were also very demanding and I had terrible time management to prioritize this one class that I’m dropping. \\n\\nI took the midterm last Tuesday, it hasn’t even been graded yet but I already know I completely bombed it. I literally left a few questions unanswered because I just didn’t know how to approach it. I felt like crying so hard in the middle of class. \\n\\nI don’t feel like I belong at this university. I’m so dumb. Or at least I’m the type of student that takes advantage of retaking courses but I wish I wasn’t. I wish I was a smarter student that can just take the class once and move on. But it’s always math classes that I have to retake and I’m so mad. \\n\\nI know some people are gonna say I should reconsider my major if I struggle with math classes, well the thing is that I actually do well with classes that are focused on my major it’s just unfortunate that my degree requires me to take math classes. So as much as I hate it, I’m still gonna learn and do whatever it takes. \\n\\nI’m just so upset right now. I’m not even working part time.

Graduated high school with high honors, basically every teacher and adult in my life practically begging me to go. I go into college for history (my then-and-still favorite subject), despite not having a single clue what I wanted to do with the degree (I don't care for teaching, museum work is pretty much all boring hometown history that doesn't interest me in the slightest).\\n\\nI end up going to a pathetic school that is cutting two programs every year, yet still has millions to throw at sports and vanity projects. This isn't to try to shift blame, all of my (many, *many*) academic failings in college are 100% my fault. I constantly procrastinated, barely studied for most courses. I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you why I was so suicidal bad at most of them if you asked me. Those problems became a million times worse from 2020-2021 when courses were online-only, which I found almost completely incompatible with my brain. Should go without saying, but transferring is not an option with my GPA.\\n\\nAfter the online courses ended, I realized I started to hate even being on the campus, every time I went there, it feels like a panic attack was just hanging over me, ready to hit me at a moment's notice. The brutalist (read: cheap) concrete buildings straight out of the Khruschev administration don't help lol.\\n\\nI looked forward to actually learning things, and being able to explore my interests in an academic setting. Unfortunately, besides a couple of amazing professors, I learned almost nothing I couldn't have already learned on my own from free online courses or just simply reading.\\n\\nThe American higher education system is nothing more than a mafia that has no interest in anything about you besides your bank account.

I'm still enrolled, and this morning I was sent a letter demanding another $2000 in payments. I'm almost certain at this point I'm just going to tank the debt and drop out. Just thinking about it makes me nauseous instantly, and my brain starts going to suicide after thinking about it a bit longer. I've already taken multiple semesters off, including this one. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life before college, I didn't know what I wanted to do when I was in college, and I don't know what I want to do now. Basically, College has made no difference in my life aside from the fuckload of debt, mental illness, stress, and wasted time. Whatever.\\n\\nI know there's a million posts on this sub that read exactly like mine, but I figure I might as well add on to the pile. Give me some advice, kind words, or call me a pussy idiot.\\n\\nE: I'm actually pretty surprised how many replies and upvotes this got. I wanna thank everyone for the kind and harsher words and advice alike. I think the overwhelming theme I get from the replies is that I have a lot of options to explore, and that I'm not locked into whatever cast I chose when I was 17. I'm most likely going to take a couple semesters off at the minimum, and try to gather some more experience while I try to explore a few more options in terms of what I might want to do for a career.

Recently I’ve made the decision to major in illustration. This decision was made because I am genuinely sick and tired of my college and the god awful experiences I’ve had at this miserable “higher education” institution. Basically, of my possible majors, illustration would take the shortest additional time to complete. I just started year four and after this year I’ll still have two more full years with 9 credits or 3 courses each semester. This really sucks. \\n\\nAnyways, I’ve taken a large number of art classes, all of them redundant and repetitive classes that are for some reason all required. So far I’ve taken Drawing I, Painting I, Two Dimensional Design, Three Dimensional Design, Typography I, and Digital Design.

In this class we work on one big drawing project the whole semester. Which would normally sound great but it is turning out horribly. \\n\\nFor starters, I really I liked my idea for the piece and I liked how it looked at first. Dare I say it, I thought I would enjoy this. But, because art can’t ever be fun or creative in college, my professor criticized me for my ideas and told me to change a bunch of things. At first I went with it because in art school critiques essentially hold your grade at gunpoint. I obliged and followed her ideas. \\n\\nThen, today, for another critique on our work in progress, she claimed I did a bunch of things wrong and that I should just start over. All while coming off very condescending and rude in a sort of a “I know best” way. Also, this assignment’s criteria seem to be either a setup for student failure or she’s just really stupid or ignorant. \\n\\nI want to die inside. I loved what I had come up with but then she wants it all changed to fit her mold all so I can get a good grade. I’m tired of this shit. I’m genuinely burnt out. I haven’t enjoyed drawing as much as I used to in some time. I really worry after this I won’t want to draw anymore. Does anyone have any tips on how to keep enjoying creating artwork on your own while in college for art? I try to do my own stuff and just immediately think it’s not good enough and give up. Sorry for the length, I’m just not in a great place and need to vent. \\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nI’m burnt out on art classes because they are repetitive, uncreative, and the professors are condescending and rude all the time with impossible expectations or horrible unhelpful critiques.', \"Depressed and struggling through college I'm not saying that I have any immediate plans or anything but I'm going to talk about suicidal feelings and one of the main reasons why I am depressed .I'm depressed and suicidal because I'm stressed about school, work and managing credit card debt.

I have been trying to get a masters degree for eight years. And because I don't have any motivation it has been harder. My lack of motivation might be due to my depression. I also have a rough time balancing school with work.  I am also worried about my mother. She seems to be developing knee problems. She works as a nurse at night and I am worried something bad might happen to her since she is always entering other people's homes. I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels.

I don't blame her. I've been in school for eight years! She is getting tired of me. I should have studied harder. And my credit card debt is stressing me out. And my sister is getting mad at me because of all the reasons my mother is. She's tired of me living off of my mom and not talking responsibility for my life. She’s ever suggesting that I cut my hours at work to pay down my credit card debt, which is not something I can afford to do since I have so many bills.

I have no idea how long it’s going to take for me to finish those credits but the longer I stay at my home the more I feel suicidal and I’m truly worried I will take my own life. It doesn’t help that socially I’m watching everyone progress while l feel so behind. I know this is consequences for my actions but I seriously feel depressed because I don’t think I can transfer by next fall anymore. My dream was always to go to a university out of state but now it feels impossible and I still cannot handle the reality of it.', \"How to survive college if you haven't studied anything in last 2 years?  Since covid I haven't studied anything, and have forgotten most of the things before that. I was in 12th grade, after online classes my school didn't teach anything and passed everyone. I would have failed but got passed. I thought I didn't study anything but I should, so I took a gap year to do so. After taking gap year, I realized I couldn't study on my own so I asked my parents many times to get me a tutor, but they refused. I wasn't able to manage on my own. Then I became very depressed and lonely and didn't study anything. I failed all my college entrance exams. My confidence is low. I can't afford therapist.\\n\\nNow my father is sending me to a cheap community college near home. I thought community colleges were fine but the state of them in my country is very bad. It is filled with junkies and teachers that don't teach. They ridicule me everyday because I have forgotten basic stuff like dipole moment and organic compounds. And I can't even choose the subject I am interested in. I feel scared to go but I have to go because of attendance policy. I wanted guidance and thought I would get it in college and was excited to go but this is complete shit. There are no counsellors or advisors. I come home and it is the same thing, my parents call me a loser and talk illtreatlingly. I feel depressed and occasionally suicidal. But worst I can't think straight on how to move forward.\\n\\nHow to cope and move forward?\", 'Bad idea to transfer? I’m at my college and despite prestige it sucks here. \\n\\nI love the academics, faculty, and lgbt acceptance in here and the school is the best of the nation. \\n\\nI’m tired of this shit though. For more than two years I’ve never been able to find a solid friend group due to autism and honestly i feel like I have a gun at the back of my head the more I stay here. I risk violence from church friends if I speak up about the abuse I endured while growing up in their church (they have a local branch on campus) and I’m tired of the stigma of staying here. I was locked out of opportunities because my sister attended the same school last year and she would out me to my parents. She’s gone now to a new college but I’m tired of my social situation and literally every single day I stay here more it feels like I am more at risk for violence. I also never really got any sort of independence and influence from my family as they are in state close by and have some sort of ties to the school. But my biggest dilemma is that my parents will discipline me harshly and I will face immense pressure from the church for speaking up about the psychological abuse I endured. \\n\\nMy new college is less accepting and the administration is less competent. The friend group I’m in I’ve known them for two fucking years and I have problems with their political beliefs being questionable but otherwise they’re the most fucking tight knit group I’ve ever known since I applied to colleges in 2021. Honestly they’re the only thing making me sane and I already attempted suicide because of my conditions at my current college and I would’ve been dead without them. \\n\\nI want that future. But I don’t know if I deserve it considering I also have a scholarship to my current uni which is a dream for most people but a slap in the face to me as in return I may lose my fucking livelihood with dangerous people on campus (being my former church friends). Idk but I will lose the little emotional support my family provides and if things get bad enough I might be disowned by my family entirely and risk homelessness (not a big chance but being raised in a cult it can happen when people trust the institution over their own children and go as far as to shun them). \\n\\nI’m behind on credits. I have 3 years left. Should I stick it out or transfer?', 'I’m at my lowest point and I feel like I have no idea what to do. Only one friend has noticed because dealing with untreated mental illness for over a decade I’ve learned how to hide things VERY well around people other than my parents (because they know what’s wrong even if you try to hide it). I’m a sophomore in college and I’m at a point where I am somehow both overworked and depressed. I have so much to do but I have terrible thoughts and just cannot do anything when I get back home except sleep. Even sleeping has gotten hard and I delay it as much as possible because I have horrible dreams. \\n\\n\\nI’m starting to believe it’s more than just depression and something more serious like psychosis or even schizoaffective issues, but I don’t want to self diagnose if I’m not sure. I’ve started thinking all my friends are plotting to hurt me and secretly hate being around me. I also have had moments where I think I am a spiritual being and people are trying to hurt me for that. After it’s over I realize these thoughts are stupid but when you’re in it it’s hard. I’ve been suicidal and had to stop myself from ending my life multiple times in the last two weeks.\\n\\n\\nI think the hardest part is I don’t know what to do. I see a therapist but not that often and I have a habit of tricking myself into downplaying it to others so they don’t realize anything is wrong. I don’t think the wellness center on campus could do much. I also have to be very careful about who’s help I do seek because I can get really upset if I feel scared or like people are trying to hurt me. Does anyone know what I can do? I can’t keep feeling like this.', 'College has become unbearable. I\\'m a chemistry major, so my life was mostly studying *before* COVID, but now it\\'s all I ever do. I have two lab classes per week, a weekly oral report in one class, and a 20-page lab report due every week in another. I average about three quizzes per week, and just finished my fifth midterm this week. \\n\\nI literally don\\'t do anything but work anymore. I\\'m severely depressed and my friends don\\'t talk anymore because, well, nobody actually sees each other. We have to do a mandatory two-week quarantine in a hotel room if we even come into the same room as a positive case, and I don\\'t think I\\'ll be able to handle the stress of full quarantine plus my course load. Expulsion after the second COVID-related offense. A truly disturbing number of people I know have either attempted suicide or developed serious drug issues in the past couple of months.

I feel like this is absolutely ruining me. \\n\\nI want to help stop the spread, but at what cost to my mental and physical wellbeing? I feel like such a piece of shit because my college\\'s administration *constantly* sends out emails shaming students, telling us we should be ashamed if we don\\'t agree with the restrictions put in place (because it\\'s \"our duty\" to help). One of my weekly COVID tests came back \"invalid\" (meaning an error occured in the analysis), and our health center lectured ME when I called to reschedule, as if it was somehow my fault. I completely agree that we need to do our part to stop COVID, but I\\'m tired of the shame and threats, because I feel like the restrictions are slowly killing me. Making students feel ashamed for wanting normalcy is the worst possible thing for anyone with a mental illness. \\n\\nWhat\\'s the point anymore? My college doesn\\'t allow gap years, so I have no choice but to suffer through literal *constant* work and studying, all in solitude, with nothing to break the monotony.

Idk. Just needed to get that off my chest. :(', 'I hate college Sorry to be negative but-\\nI’ve been chronically depressed and suicidal since middle school. I thought going to college would be a good thing, but it’s not. I’m a 19 year old girl in my second year now and I hate it. I thought I was supposed to have the best times of my life but in reality I’m stuck on zoom where no one even interacts with each other. I thought I was supposed to meet the love of my life, have my first relationship, or experience a love life for once. But nah, that’s not gonna happen. I barely have friends, and my best friend is just as depressed as me. Yes I get help, yes I take meds, trust me I’ve tried it all.

Thank you to the people who encouraged me to keep going. Y’all are the best and I really appreciated all of your kind words back when I was really struggling. \\n\\nI dropped out of college in the middle of my last semester of my last year. I go to a school 4 hours away from my family. Last fall, my grandparents died in a car accident and I was basically forced to mourn them in isolation (because of distance, online classes, busy friends, etc.) Last semester was awful but I managed to make it through with B’s and C’s. I started heavily drinking though. This current semester my suicidal thoughts and self-harm habits hit me like a ton of bricks. I hated my apartment, my friends, my school, and most of all myself. I was drinking 2 bottles of wine a day and struggling to even get out of bed and go to class. I dropped out and checked myself into a psych ward for 6 days. Now that I’ve been out for a few weeks it’s starting to hit me that I dropped out when I only needed 3 more classes to graduate. I feel like a failure, but I know that if I had kept going the way that I was, it would’ve literally killed me. I have no motivation to go back either, I was a straight A student up until this point- in the honors college with a merit scholarship and everything. I hate that I dropped out because I feel like I’ve disappointed the old me who loved learning. But I couldn’t take it anymore.', \"College and depression rant Sorry guys I just need the space to rant. I probably won't be reading the comments. Idk if I can take someone being an asshole to me on here today. CW: depression and suicidal thoughts.\\n\\nI've never considered killing myself more than in college. The constant pressure and feeling of being evaluated just gets to me. I'm so tired of it. The sheer amount of people and work too. So often I feel like I'm not strong enough to live in this world. Sometimes I think about if I were to kill myself, would my professors remember me? Would they care? \\n\\nLast semester I had an oral final with my ethics professor. I started talking to her about the idea of the 'good life' in different figures. I choked up thinking about Plato's Phaedo and how he says every pain or pleasure rivets the body to the soul. One of the reasons I love the Phaedo is because whenever I read that it soothes my anxiety and depression for a moment. I wish I could place myself above the pains that I feel but I'm so weak. I try so hard but I constantly fail. I am so embarrassed but I can't say these things to anyone else.\\n\\nOkay that is enough word vomit.

I pretty much fell into believing the myth  that it\\'s  easy cuz it has math. Back in high school, I failed to learn  proper  study habits and effectively whatever I studied was forgotten  roughly a  week after the test. During my first college exam, I was  terrified- I  had a month to study two subjects and barely could  remember anything.  And then, the professor said \"You can use your  books.\\'\\' And with liberal  book use i ended up acing the exam. Most  exams after that were open  book, and i aced and aced.

Then COVID hit,  and I was introduced to the  \\'\\'wonderful\\'\\' online school, which  additionally impacted me. The final  hit was, when after my second year  my father got sick with throat  cancer. I saw the strong, wise man that  had raised me be reduced to a  bed-ridden, diaper using shell of a  person. My focusing ability crashed  to zero. Barely anything  registered, I was apathetic to everything(I  still am), I had no energy,  I stopped caring about accounting. But I  kept acing and acing.

I started this podcast at the beginning on my freshman year, kind of to show my journey through as a college student mentally.

Basically, I hit a rough patch once covid hit and everything kinda turned to shit.

In high school I did really well, but in college did a complete 180. I was at Syracuse for a year, and failed my first semester entirely. I didn’t do much better during the second, and got a B, C, and two Ds and ended up withdrawing from one of my classes. I tried to submit a transfer app to a state college, and explained the situation with my mental health but unsurprisingly got denied. The admissions counselor I was in contact with said to do a semester at my local community college and try again for spring. I’ve been at community college the last semester, and did well in two classes but bombed the other two. In total, I have 18 credits, plus a couple AP credits from high school. I know I have no shot at transferring with those grades, so my plan is to take this semester off, focus on getting help, and apply for fall 2022 as a first year with a clean slate and basically say that I pushed back attending university bc of the pandemic. The problem is, I really want to be able to attend the four-year I applied to earlier, but I don’t know if it would even be possible for me to apply as a first year when I already submitted a transfer application.

I loved learning and studying, especially my two greatest passions: art and technology. I loved art but never took art class in school because I prioritized an engineering program my district offered. I got to compete, but I struggled a lot with misogyny and the mental tax of needing to be the best or I don't deserve to be there. so I decided I wouldn't pursue a career in tech, because I didn't want to fight that battle for the rest of my life. I also really hated math. so I chose art.\\n\\nI initially got accepted to an art school for one of the top rated programs globally in the honors program. I was ecstatic. but I graduated high school in 2020, and even after moving to my campus I almost immediately dropped out and went back home. the sudden switch to online was too insufferable to deal with, the classes were in disarray, my roommates (who I was childhood friends with) sucked me dry financially and then cut me off, etc. pretty much as soon as I dropped out my love and drive for art and education died, because I was at rock bottom mentally and so disappointed in myself. I have struggled with depression my whole life and that mental state I was in was terrifying, and the only thing that kept me from not ending it all was my cat, because then he would be alone again. I thank him every day for being my reason to stay because i am at the happiest in my life and have a wonderful romantic relationship. anyways back to the sad stuff.\\n\\nthen I began at the university in my home town as a psychology/undecided major. I just picked psychology but then only did gen eds because there wasn't an undecided category. assumed I would make up my mind in my 2nd year. but holy fuck, that school SUCKED. not the professors. the actual administrators and counselors. never helped me sign up for classes, would randomly drop and assign me classes THE DAY BEFORE THE SEMESTER , not register my Pell grants so I couldn't buy my school supplies, etc. I did 2 years there but one semester was all for naut because I had another Mental Episode and didn't do any work the last month and didn't know about getting that pardoned.\\n\\nnow I'm in an online university about halfway done with my degree. its more fast pace with 8 week classes. I am finally feeling that joy I had for education in high school. but it feels really slow so I've been teaching myself stuff on the side. I major in Computer Science now, just like I dreamed I would when I was 13. I still am fearful of my future struggles in the tech industry and hope I can remedy it by securing a remote job. working remotely is a big thing for me because I have health issues along with being autistic and struggling to hold a job because of my poor attendance due to always being sick. \\n\\nI am lucky to have a supportive parent. I am lucky to be able to focus 100% on my studies and not have to work a real job. I am lucky to have stinking cute cats and a happy relationship. but it took so long to get here im worried about the financial ruin I will be facing after graduation. I want to continue to live in this aesthetic student bliss where I'm happy and succeeding and not face the consequences of jumping schools so much. I have a really good and easy life now for this past year, but it's been really hard for most of my life im waiting for the other shoe to drop.\\n\\n\\ntl;dr\\nit's fucking hard out here for a drop out art school student pursuing tech at my 3rd university.\", 'What are your experiences going to a campus counselor/therapist or using any other campus mental health resource? Once I\\'m on-campus in the Fall, I\\'m thinking about going to the school mental health center for a multitude of reasons that I\\'m not going to into here completely here, but here are the highlights\\n\\n* overall stress about college, the pandemic, being an adult, etc.\\n* LGBTQ+ support \\n* depression\\n* anxiety\\n* family issues\\n* help with some maladaptive coping mechanisms\\\\*\\n* intrusive thoughts\\\\*\\n* passive suicidal ideation\\\\* \\n\\nAs you can see, there\\'s some starred items on this list and that\\'s because I\\'m a bit uncertain about whether I even should talk about these things after reading some people\\'s experiences with school counselors.\\n\\nPeople who confided about their issues to campus counselors and then ended up being involuntarily hospitalized (even if they weren\\'t a danger to themself or others), put on a forced medical leave from the school where they weren\\'t even allowed to be on campus, broke confidentiality and got their parents involved (even if the students were 18+), or otherwise just weren\\'t helped\\n\\nAnd some people say the mental health resources on campuses are just for the brochures and don\\'t actually do anything remotely helpful because they don\\'t want to be held liable if something bad happens and it can be expensive to actually provide effective help for students. But it really just seems counterproductive to have therapy where you can\\'t actually feel safe to open up about anything that\\'s really bothering you because you\\'re not trying to delay your graduation plan or get in trouble with your family \\n\\nWhile there are students at my school who say our campus mental health center is actually pretty helpful, I\\'m not sure how much help they can provide for more serious issues without just calling the police and forcing me into a ward \"voluntarily\" or banishing me from campus for some unknown amount of time \\n\\nObviously, I\\'ll be asking questions about their confidentiality agreements and whatever exceptions they might have before I reveal anything, but I would like to get a better picture of what campus therapists are actually like so I know what to expect', \"Scared to take a semester off of College I did really well last semester getting As and B's despite having 6 classes that were 3 hours long a day and I commute. It costed me my mental health though. I have diagnksed depression and alot of it is situational including my anxiety. Every week I had panic attacks, mental breakdowns, and suicidal thoughts. I wanted to take a semester off and decided to do so until my parents convinced me otherwise. Also the fact that I would hate myself if I fell behind in college. Even though I just began therapy again and JUST started my medication again. The meds won't change my negative mindset. I truly hate myself and college doesn't help me but it just makes my self esteem worse especially since I am in art school and constantly comparing my work. Not only that but there is always someone better than you and it makes me feel inferior to others. I just had a month off for winter break but I am still exhausted and barely did anything. I just don't know if I should take a semester off. None of my friends are except one who hasn't started college yet and one other person is only taking one class. I feel like a failure all the time. Should I take time off even thought my next classes are very crucial to my degree or should I try and take time to myself?\", 'I don\\'t know if I can last one more day in college. I\\'ve given everything I could to try to finish my degree and now I feel my life is at stake.  \\n\\nIt\\'s been 6 years. I started off wanting to be a music teacher so I could help teach kids how to sing and make the world a better place. In year 1 my main mentor was fired for a horrible scandal that affected the whole program and I resented myself for looking up to him and being oblivious.\\n\\nIn year 2 I ended up in the psych ward for being suicidal and took a medical leave and started therapy and medications. I came back the next semester but now struggled with how I process information and everyday would fall asleep in the library because it just overwhelms me trying to study or read or learn things. I gained a lot of weight so quickly from the meds and I got so tired all the time.\\n\\nIn year 3 I developed a horrible insomnia problem one of the worst cases my psychiatrist at the time said she\\'d seen. I had so much night anxiety I avoided going to bed because every time I laid there for hours unable to sleep, my head was filled with horrible thoughts about a broken friendship that would take years of therapy to get over. I got registered with my school\\'s disability accommodations, which helped some. But every semester I still have been feeling like I\\'m in constant unhealthy misery and I kept failing all my non-performance classes like academic type classes that require more writing and reading and intellectual engagement and the only time I do pass those types of classes is because I\\'m retaking them after failing them the first time.\\n\\nIn year 4 I took less units to make it manageable but I developed an annoying vomiting problem associated with anxiety. Had to vomit into a trashcan before every music performance because I constantly felt it almost come out and would only feel better after getting it out of my system. My insomnia got way worse missing morning classes for several weeks, my suicidal tendencies got worse, no matter how hard I tried I couldn\\'t really absorb material anymore, I got an official diagnosis for PTSD and psychosis as well. I quit my job to focus on school but I kept failing classes anyways. I made a post here about what to do and I feel like I followed all the advice there:\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eltgxx/i\\\\_need\\\\_help\\\\_figuring\\\\_what\\\\_to\\\\_do\\\\_after\\\\_failing\\\\_my/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=android\\\\_app&utm\\\\_name=androidcss&utm\\\\_term=1&utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eltgxx/i_need_help_figuring_what_to_do_after_failing_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\\n\\nI left school for 2 years in a leave of absence to try to sort out all my horrible mental health problems. I\\'ve been through so many different therapists and psychiatrists and peer counselors and therapy books and Youtube self help and tried so many things and diets and cbd and exercise and approaches to life and through so much heartbreak losing friends because of my depression and trying to better myself and just learn how to decently manage all my issues. It took me a fucking year to develop the habit to brush my teeth daily without having a mental breakdown over it. At one point I hadn\\'t seen the sun for 3 months because of my insomnia. I tried so hard and to teach myself so many things, I couldn\\'t even enjoy what was basically a 2 year vacation from college because of how much shit I struggled with everyday. I took a hiatus from being a musician. Eventually I took a big scary step in getting myself back into it, and had some really memorable experiences with people and kids again that inspired me to go back to college and finish my music degree.\\n\\nI came back to school this semester and took even less units (10). I had prepared so much, by re-auditioning into the music program, using a lot of self help and study habits and organization habits and sleep habits I spent all that time learning, using accommodations from the disability office, I even had this cool expensive portable fan I always had because I get so anxious when I get sweaty. I did well in the first few weeks but now it\\'s week 12 and the past 7 weeks I have constantly felt like I was one bad day away from going back to the psych ward. I have missed so many classes again, so much homework, this one class I\\'m doing for the second time (because I failed it) we have to listen to orchestral music to I can\\'t even listen to it because it induces my PTSD.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried a bunch of different creative ADHD methods of learning and working in unconventional ways like drawing shapes because it helps me listen to orchestral music or finding a giant whiteboard room in the library and going through my learning processes with expo markers instead of a paper and pencil or laptop. I have missed 6 weeks of my music history class because it\\'s at 8am and my insomnia has fucking triple worsened. I\\'ve started sleeping more and more like 11 hours a day because of all this stress and I tried sleeping in my car in the college parking lot just so I can make it to the class, I tried going to bed at 6pm but that didn\\'t work either. My history professor cut me a lot of slack when I explained all this in her office hours offering me an alternative way I can still somehow pass the course by watching a lot of related history videos or audio medias and just summarize everything so I technically am fulfilling the course learning outcomes. But no matter how hard I tried I just can\\'t do anything anymore. I\\'m not fucking around going to clubs or parties or wasting time doing things that made me wish I had used that time on school. I\\'ve done everything I possibly could and don\\'t feel I\\'ve made any wrong decisions. I\\'ve done everything my therapist advised me to do like taking just a bit of personal time for myself everyday, trying to make new friends again, etc.\\n\\nMy other professor, who I really look up to, called me into his office about something I already knew I was in trouble for. We started off by just asking me how I\\'ve been doing recently and before I knew it I just started breaking down so badly just ugly crying about how horrible everything has been, how much I have struggled with every single class, and that I\\'m aware I\\'ve been \"acting out\" and acting inappropriately erratic sometimes in some classes like saying weird shit in front of others that\\'s made them uncomfortable because \"being a goof\" has been one of the ways I cope with my fucking severe ADHD. And nobody wants to be my fucking friend because this is all they see. My psychiatrist has not given me anything for my ADHD because they \"liked how well I was internally treating my own symptoms at the beginning of the semester with my dedicated habits and structure\" but I have to wait like 2 months between each appointment because of waiting lists and I have been trying so much to get my hands on some fucking Adderall or something to calm me down. I kept crying about how much I hate college that this place has been nothing but \"misery failure and loneliness for the past 7 years\" and if I wanted to take even less units to make it easier on myself I\\'d need to pay tuition out of pocket instead of financial aid now I have to pay money to be fucking miserable here and it\\'ll take another 3 or 4 years at minimum and I just wanted my grandma to see me graduate college before she dies because she\\'s been the only good parent to me all my life.\\n\\nThey were very supportive and just listening to me rant about all my fucking traumas and why it relates to how much I\\'m struggling: my family abused me so much I regularly had murderous intrusive thoughts as a teenager, I sacrifice so much to make myself needed by others even if they treat me like shit because being \"used\" by people feels like love and I am incapable of having my own self-worth, I\\'ve had to learn how to be good at lying and hiding how I feel inside by being a goof and how much I\\'ve learned to read other people\\'s body language and facial expressions and slight changes in energies, goddamn it I can\\'t type up anymore of this shit I can\\'t relieve all this anymore. They said I was a really amazing person and they asked me \"Do you think you\\'d be happy as a music teacher?\" And I just shrugged my shoulders and kept crying because I didn\\'t even know the answer. and that they weren\\'t even aware of how much I constantly go through and I said it\\'s because I\\'ve opened up to people and mentors and got hurt so many times I\\'m too scared to go through it one more time, and they said they want to check up on me again very soon because they were seriously worried about my well-being. He gave me some good life advice before I left and I have never broken down like that ever in my entire life in front of any adult or therapist and I realistically think from my own history that it will get worse from here.\\n\\nJust today, I was overwhelmed by all these murderous intrusive thoughts coming back, I kept punching my fist against the dash while I was driving home in my car, screaming my lungs out, experiencing flashbacks about all the horrible parts of my life while trying to focus on driving, and being so worried what would happen if I stepped foot again on college campus in front of all these classmates I feel like don\\'t give a shit about me, have never even cared to understand why I\\'m like this, and that I\\'m going to snap in front of everyone and start doing really horrible things when I have a psychotic breakdown because I can\\'t hide how horrible I feel anymore.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do anymore, I don\\'t really feel like I have anyone left except one really good friend on reddit. All of my previous symptoms and health struggles are still present and affecting me simultaneously even with medication and therapy support. My therapist recommended a local crisis house I can go to where I can leave anytime instead of the psych ward. I\\'ve given everything I could\\'ve to try to finish my music degree, even if I didn\\'t end up becoming a music teacher in life I wanted to at least finish my degree for my own self satisfaction but I can\\'t take this anymore. I can\\'t take one more semester. I don\\'t even think I can finish the semester. I don\\'t even think I can handle one more day. I just wanted to make the world a better place and help children but I can\\'t even make my own life a better place and I can\\'t even soothe my inner child that has been crying out for help since day 1.\\n\\nTLDR: got depression and anxiety and PTSD and insomnia and ADHD and a shit ton of other mental health problems I\\'ve spent years working through but no matter how much I try and start over again with therapy and disability accommodations and creative study habits and meditation and CBD and exercise and diet and every fucking solution imaginable I can\\'t do this anymore. I don\\'t realistically think I\\'ll get through college to finish my music degree without committing suicide before I get my degree or any degree or even taking more years only taking a couple classes at a time or transferring to any other school. I\\'ve had more and more psychotic breakdowns everyday and I\\'m scared I will do something horrible if I step onto college campus one more time.', 'Why keep going Title. I don\\'t see a reason for trying in school anymore, and to a broader extent life itself. The burnout, indifference to learning, not retaining what I learn, etc. is too much. I think I hate my major. I just want to do media editing, but am trapped in these bullshit prerequisite courses where I learn all these boring things about film theory and social justice that don\\'t relate to it. I need to get through these courses to get to the upper division editing ones, and fuck me I don\\'t even know if I\\'ll like them once I get there. I don\\'t want to direct student films, or work alongside exhausting student creatives/auteurs, or pick up a million unrelated, unpaid internships just to stay competitive in the job market, but my degree basically demands it. I guess I owe this all to my shitty planning...well, that and college is a scam. I wish someone warned me.\\n\\nSo, I have to get so far into my major to actually experience classes I *might* like, and if I don\\'t, then switching majors from that point on will be a massive waste of time and money I don\\'t have. No backup major or anything of course, unless I\\'m prepared to go hungry. And that\\'s just college; I\\'m so fucking unprepared for the real world. It takes all the effort I can muster just to get all As in classes. I\\'ve got nothing else. There\\'s no positives in my life anymore, and if there\\'s no positives, why keep going? Tell me, I legitimately need some reasons to not take the easy way out of this bullshit. This post is just me narrowing down if there *are* some left. Don\\'t post that dumbass suicide hotline, it\\'s intensely unhelpful, almost makes me want to do it out of spite. How do you keep going?\\n\\nBut first, please don\\'t bother with the \"it will get better\" pep talk. That\\'s a lie people have been telling me for ~10 years now and I hate it. I\\'m downright resentful of it. My school\\'s mostly back to normal next semester, but because I\\'ve been absorbed by the amorphous blob-like thing called online school I don\\'t know if I can adapt. \\n\\nMy peace of mind is ruined; Physical classes means I\\'ll have to commute to them. What are the three most nerve-wracking activities I\\'ve ever experienced? Driving in general; people are assholes, working shitty retail to pay for my insurance, and stressing through all the errands my mom will inevitably make me do. \\n\\nMy sleeping schedule is ruined; how the fuck do I adjust to early classes after a year of asynchronous ones. \\n\\nMy study habits are ruined; I can\\'t imagine memorizing things for a test anymore when they\\'ve all been open-book for so long. I think online school actually gave me ADHD- my attention span is shot and I can\\'t pay attention to anything. All I have is blind hope that it disappears when physical classes arrive. \\n\\nMy social life is preemptively ruined; Making friends online is and has always been a farce. Everyone\\'s too hesitant and everything feels too awkward. I don\\'t know my school, I don\\'t know kids in my major. I *do* know I\\'m not going to have time for socializing and clubs once back because I now know the college workload is unreasonable. Nevermind I\\'m socially stunted to begin with. \\n\\nI hate online classes with a passion. I want to get away from them, but it\\'s very likely I\\'m exchanging one shitshow for another by transitioning to physical. Different stressors, same quantity of them. Don\\'t tell me things will get better. I understand as strangers you can\\'t promise me many things with substance behind them, so instead of posting empty encouragement (#wegotthisfam #slayit), I\\'d rather you just not post anything at all.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t bother to suggest therapy. I\\'ve always been a little suicidal, but until this semester I never felt desperate enough to need therapy for it. What did I find when I looked for help? My school\\'s counseling program has a 50/50 chance of actually helping me, or locking me up in an institution that could only make me hate life more. I can\\'t take those odds. School counselors are always trying to push you out to private therapists anyways. \\n\\nI looked up those- I was *gently* told to fuck off by one organization in the consultation call because I couldn\\'t afford the standard 12 weeks of sessions (~$1000). Fucksakes, I only wanted a few. Low-cost organizations are happy to have me...if I can wait 3-4 months. I wish they told me to fuck off too, honestly, because it\\'s not like most people desperate enough to seek out therapy can just *cope* with their shit for that long no problem. \\n\\nI discovered therapy in the U.S. is as much a joke as our traditional healthcare is: available but too expensive, or inexpensive but always unavailable. It\\'s not an option, for me at least. Finding that out after so, so many people said it\\'s worked wonders for them, hurt. It really hurt.\\n\\nBut, at risk of going beyond subreddit parameters, how do you keep going in life? I like to think I\\'ve \"accepted\" that I\\'ll never live up to my unrealistic pipedreams, or that I won\\'t find love, or have my own place, etc. but I still get sad over these things. I don\\'t know what it\\'s like to be content with life, but so many others do and persevere through the bullshit under worse circumstances than me. How? just how?', 'Anyone else feel like college reopening plans do not care about students mental health? Measuring the impact of COVID-19 is more than just the death count. The virus can cause lingering health problems as studies have shown it could be a [vascular disease](https://www.google.com/amp/s/elemental.medium.com/amp/p/2c4032481ab2). The US has experienced a [three fold increase in depression rates after the pandemic arrived.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770146) I hate to use human lives in game theory, but I am very frustrated as a college student to see policies drawn out to prevent at risk and vulnerable populations who may only have a few years left to live get priority over young people who have much more time to live. Depression is a serious issue amongst many students, and I am afraid suicide rates will increase partly due to this “new normal”. \\n\\nIt is very clear that in person communication is better than anything online; college students overwhelmingly said in internal surveys that they prefer in person classes and would like to return to campus this fall. However, this is not want students wanted at all. There is a reason why college students are breaking the rules, they are incredibly strict. There is an obvious tradeoff in increased mental health issues amongst people when it comes to enforcing these new strict rules, but this has been ignored for some reason. \\n\\nI am not advocating for massive parties with outside guests. I just believe there is a more healthy medium for college students to go to small gatherings without putting at risk populations in danger. The CDC says someone is only a close contact after [15 minutes of being someone closer than six feet to you,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-tracing.html) then no one at risk (professors, employees) should be getting infected if proper precautions are taken with capacity limits and proper sanitation methods. \\n\\nIf you do not want to get infected for whatever reason, you can stay in your dorm room or apartment and if there are proper protocols in place you will not get infected. To people who want to be able to socialize without all of the restrictions, there should be a way to do so without the possibility of transmitting out of the student population. \\n\\nI find it incredibly unfair to students to have the only measure of success being how many cases your school has. This is not looking at the full picture, and by having so many restrictions, it may be causing more harm than good.', 'college ruined me. 23F. Graduated ~1 year ago. \\n\\nI just feel so hopeless and broken. I destroyed my body and mind to get through school and it’s done nothing for me but traumatize me. \\n\\nI had issues with depression and anxiety before school but it just made everything so much worse. I went to a largish school that was really focused on Greek life for the degree programs (a terrible decision by 18yo me, from a very small town). I remained an outsider there and never really made friends, failed to click with any clubs or groups. \\n\\nMy whole life my family’s dream for me was to go to college, so I felt like I couldn’t fail them or go to them when I was struggling. I also have commitment issues so I didn’t feel like I could switch schools. \\n\\nI became extremely, extremely isolated. I would go weeks without talking to anyone except for an older lady who would check me into the cafeteria. I didn’t have a car the first two years so I couldn’t really go home, I was just stuck up there except for thanksgiving and winter breaks. I was too mentally to work so I didn’t have any extra money. Also, I didn’t understand how my meal plan worked so I was just eating 1 meal a day for a long time. \\n\\nI became extremely depressed, anxiety skyrocketed to the point of daily panic attacks, touch starved, and suicidal. I just wanted the pain to stop. I buried myself in school work, escaped through social media, and basically shut off all emotion and went into survival mode so I could push through. Never made a true friend, never had a relationship, never went to a party. \\n\\nThings got better once I had a car for the last 2 1/2 years and I could visit home. For two semesters during COVID lockdown I actually got to work on school from home, which helped a lot, but then my last semester we were back in person. There it all came back and it got worse again. \\n\\nI feel like I was a ghost, no one ever noticed me or knew I existed. After graduation I basically had a nervous breakdown and I moved back in with my family. I would constantly have panic attacks even after leaving and every night in my nightmares I would be back there working on endless projects and stressing about tests I didn’t study for, or back in the dorm bunk beds wishing I wouldn’t wake up. Certain smells or things would also take me back. Even driving through the city the college is in I break out in a cold sweat. I feel like I’m still mentally stuck there and still mentally 18 years old. \\n\\nLuckily my family intervened and got me medication and therapy, but other than stopping the panic attacks the meds didn’t do much for my mental health and my social anxiety was too much for talk therapy.\\n\\nAfter all that I sacrificed and all I destroyed in my health I’m still in my hometown barely holding onto a job that only requires a high school diploma. I can’t move out due to financial reasons and I can’t go to another city because my whole support  system is here. \\n\\nAlso, I’m still deeply lonely. I feel like I have a void or a brokenness inside me that will never be better. I feel numb and like I’m not an active part in my own life. I’m still hurting. I’ve been really impulsive lately and I’ve been spending more money on stupid things I don’t need. I’m wanting more and more to just numb out with alcohol and weed (I haven’t actually gone that far yet but it’s harder to resist). I really want a relationship and to have my own family but all of this is in the way and I can barely care for myself. \\n\\nI feel like there was no reason for me to go through what I did, and the school can just keep on churning students through like nothing happened. What was all of this for? How do I stop feeling this way?', \"I'm breaking down I'm a college freshman on scholarship currently residing in Hungary. My first semester is almost finished and it is currently the exam period. I started college believing it would be a wonderful experience as everyone says but so far its been more or less one of the worst periods of my life. During my midterms, I did quite well. I wouldn't say that I'm really good at studies but I have managed to go through high school maintaining good grades. But it's not the same now. So far my exams have kind of sucked. Although I have managed to score good marks in my other subjects but I don't know why I feel like I can't this time. I have been having a lot (a lot) of difficulty studying. Every time I think about sitting down to study, I can't bring myself to it thinking it won't be any use since I won't be able to score good anyway and probably end up failing the subject. I've barely made any friends, although I'm not the type that does. I come from a background where mental health is treated as something that is non-existent. I have talked to some of the people, my friends, girlfriend thinking that it would help but surprisingly it hasn't. Everyone keeps saying that I have to be strong and that if I can't do something, I have to force myself to do it. Another problem is that my roommates are all scoring really good and it feels like they are not at all stressed about anything. It is not even like they study all the time. They literally sit down two days before the exam and end up acing it. I admit that I have had mental problems in the past but given the non serious attitude of my family towards mental issues, its hard for me to recognize what exactly it is that I suffer from. I have had almost five panic attacks in the last seven days. Most of the time, I feel like being on my own. I've been crying a lot alone in the bathroom since I can't really do it in my room cause of the roommates. Also I have been feeling really homesick. Sometimes I am able to somehow make my peace with the fact that it is okay if I don't do well but things even as little as seeing people talk about exams as if they know everything and seeing my roommates doing acting like brilliant know-it-alls makes me feel immensely depressed and borderline suicidal. Although I feel like maybe what I need is some friends that are going through the same thing but no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to just go up and talk to someone random even if it's just saying hi.\", \"College at home sucks when I have to listen to fighting and yelling every single day. I'm so fucking done with my family. I'm so fucking done.\\n\\nMy dad is verbally abusive and inconsiderate and doesn't care if he's yelling or distracting me, yet still wants me to get good grades. He has a sick and twisted view of what a family should be like, stuff like how I owe him for all he's given to me (like raised me), and throws a tantrum over every little thing. He calls my mom and I ungrateful, lazy, selfish, spoiled, and thinks he's the most selfless and generous person in the world. I've dealt with this for my whole life but every year of college gets tougher. He's a hypocritical, inconsiderate, self-righteous piece of shit and I'm just waiting for the day he'll be permanently gone from my life.\\n\\n\\nMy mom has to deal with this shit every day. If she ever makes a mistake or doesn't read his mind of what he wants, he'll get mad, and then another tantrum well ensue. She's at her tipping point right now and she's just complaining about him to me everyday, which I don't mind but I have stuff I need to do. I've never learned to be emotional responsive and available, given my family situation for the last 19 years of my life, so I don't know what the fuck to do. They can't divorce, they're financial codependent, so until something regarding that is taken care of I'm stuck with this.\\n\\n\\nI've tried to calmly talk to my dad about this, of course he basically disregards everything I'm saying (asking him to be more calm, quiet, and understanding) and said how I'm unappreciative and selfish and lazy again.

I go to an Ivy League. I\\'m not saying the name since I still want to graduate. Considering the amount of mental and physical damage I have endured in this abusive school, they should be paying me more. I\\'ve had a plethora of incompetent professors, many arrogant, gas lighting professors. I literally had one ask to pay for my freaking wi-fi over the pandemic. So uncalled for, incredibly invasive and insensitive. One asked a poorer student why they didn\\'t buy the books yet a week into the semester  in front of the whole class and they had to say they couldn\\'t afford them yet. I\\'ve had two professors call me lazy, one suggest I go to the office of disability just because I asked to take a quiz in her office (an arrangement I had with a previous professor or the same subject.) One prof would get up and sit next to me every class, even though I tried to sit as far away from them as possible. Another would give me the turkey neck confused face whenever I asked a question in class. I straight up had to say \"yeah, seriously\" before he would answer my questions. I had a couple near death experiences (because I became very ill and almost died) and I had hoped my professors would try to be a bit flexible with my grades and stuff, but they told me to drop their classes instead. And this is just the professors and it\\'s not even all the stories I have on them.\\n\\nOther than the professors, the student community is toxic as hell. The perfectionism is overkill.

There are few mental health resources that I know of despite the school having one the highest suicide rates in the country.

Not worth the money.', 'Getting Harrassed for Sitting? I go to a Liberal Arts University in Washington State that is a pain in the ***. Most of the students there have rich parents and don’t care about anyone below them. I hate it there and I am only go for the free scholarship.\\n\\nAnyways, it starts with me being a clinically depressed commuter student who lives with her husband about 1 1/2 hours away from the University. \\n\\nRecently, my depression has been through the damn roof! I cried for about 2 hours straight the other day… I had a chemistry lab due that I could not make up for. If I didn’t go, I would have to say goodbye to my scholarship. Due to my depression however, I did not feel safe going alone! I even teared up with the thought of going alone. I had been suicidal in the past and I was afraid I was gonna jump in front of a car or something dangerous (Ferry and Bus Commuter). My husband, who is the light of my life, decided he would go with me and wait.\\n\\nSo, we take the ferries and buses to the city where my University is in (about 2 hours that day) and we have a good time for the half of the day. I won’t go into detail because it isn’t important to the story. \\n\\nWe head to the bus stop that take us to the university and we get soaked from a sudden downpour of rain! My husband is freezing and his hands are turning white. I offer him to go back home, but he wants to still come with me to make sure I’ll be safe. We get there and realize there are no benches under cover. Luckily, it stopped raining by then, however, it was still cold. We finally find a bench he can sit on and I give him my hoodie for them to cover his legs with. I feel terrible to leave him like that but he insisted he would be ok and just try to hurry with my lab. \\n\\nI go to lab and my professor is 15 minutes! The lab takes a lot longer than expected because the details of the lab are confusing! I finish about 1:30 hours later.\\n\\nI ran outside to my husband I see him white and shivering. He was sitting on a different bench than before. I apologize for minutes and minutes without stopping, and I am on the urge of crying.\\n\\nAfter he calms me down, he explains he was on a different bench because people were harassing him. First, security harassed him for just sitting there on his phone. He wasn’t doing anything suspicious, just watching a show on his phone. Then, a few students were talking freely on “there is a weirdo sitting over on that bench”. Finally, an older lady takes a picture of him. After all that harassment, just decided to move to another spot that isn’t as noticeable.\\n\\nFor a man to accompany for wife while she was not in her right of mind is punished.

Even before college, I was always struggling with my studies because I am a slow learner. I'm also not very sociable. I have trouble making friends and, even if managed to make a few, I feel as though I don't deserve it. Nobody wants to be friends a potato. To add fuel to the fire, I'm also a huge procrastinator. Combine these together and something nasty will come out of it, i.e. Me. And after getting into college, those three things have continued to get worse. Missing classes and assignments, not being able to understand the lectures, feeling as though everyone is two steps ahead of you while you're still stuck on that last part, Having trouble with friends because they would rather hang with other people and, if they have no one to hangout with, you're their last option, which they don't like. If I had to compare me and my friends and classmates, I'd put them somewhere in, they're lazy, but smart. Whereas me, I'm lazy and stupid. \\n\\nAfter a miss hap with an assignment that was due that day, I went to a dark place. A really dark place. I'm gonna be straight, I searched up suicide reddit posts because, if I'm being frank, I really don't deserve any of this. Hell, I was only able to get into college because of my parents, and I feel like they deserve better, not some piece of shit like me. I've got siblings who are super hard working and are pretty good at what they do. So, what's to say they won't have a bright future, of course they are. I feel as though I was the mistake of my family and they only treat me nicely out of pity. \\n\\nCollege really sent me over the edge, and I don't know if I'll make it. I wanted to make my parents proud, but I'm just a failure in the worst ways possible. I am not happy, and I don't know if I ever will.  \\n\\nI would like to write more, but I can't think of any off the top of my, as sure I have alot more things I wanna say. \\n\", 'My Main Life Problem \\nTL:DR: College student struggling on what to do with life, but does not want to upset family. \\n\\nTo start off, I want to say that I apologize for this really long post.\\n\\nI had a rough childhood when I was young. I never knew what I truly wanted to be when I grew up until 7th grade when I got involved in the school musical. Ever since then, I’ve always wanted to be in the entertainment industry. I had an entire plan of going to college in New York or Philadelphia to pursue majors such as music technology, music business, and etc. The problem is I come from a family that wants their kids to be in practical and big money-making jobs. \\n\\nAs a result, I gave up my plans and I went to community college (which I am grateful about going to). Even though it was a nice way to introduce me to college academics, I was kinda rushed by advisors to pick a specific major so that I can transfer to pursue a bachelors. \\n\\nAt first in my second year of college, I majored in communications because I thought it would combine both the entertainment industry and business (which is my main alternative) together. However, I changed into business (specifically marketing) just immediately around two days at the beginning of the year because of certain classes, it made social media not fun, and I was afraid that it would not make enough money. Also, I was taking a few business classes ever since senior year at high school, so I was too used to being in business.\\n\\nAfter taking specific business classes, they were literally some of the hardest classes I took. I usually get good grades, but some of these I had to take twice and/or barely pass with a C. What made it worse was that in January 2020, that was the first time I actually thought of wanting to die (but I am not suicidal anymore, so please don’t worry about that). As a result, I ended up getting my associate’s degree a semester late. \\n\\nI am about to be in my senior year this fall and I am currently doing well grade-wise and even have a scholarship. However, at this point, I have been so unmotivated with academics. It’s like post-secondary education was never something I should have done in the first place. My unmotivation and depression is so bad that classes that do involve the arts do not even make me happy. \\n\\nThe coronavirus just proved my negativity towards college more since I had 1-2 years of college without the fun. But yet, returning to school on campus is just a horrible thought now. I might have around 1.5 to 2.5 years to finish, but it felt so long getting the associate’s already, this can feel long too. I also might not even be fully happy during graduation because I will feel salty about putting myself in this situation. \\n\\nI’ve never been the best person when it comes to making big, adult decisions (mostly because I come from a Asian-American immigrant family and other personal reasons), but I really need help. It’s like I know the best solution in my opinion is to drop out and work a full time job, but I cannot go for it because it would disappoint my family. Most of the men in my family are college dropouts, including my father who died last year; and most of the women in my family, including my mother, never went to college. That being said, I do not want to break my parents’ wishes, but I don’t want to keep giving up my happiness and self either. What should I do?', 'I completely blew my first semester, and I can\\'t even sign up for a second. How do I get out of this hole? I really need some guidance from somebody, anybody, because every time I talk to someone at my community college I just get rude and snarky comments, or they get me out of their office as fast as possible.\\n\\nThis year has been particularly brutal for me. The TL;DR is I was rejected immediately by my long distance SO shortly after being picked up at the airport, continued rejection romantically, just girl stuff. I\\'ve faced financial hardship I never thought I would have faced in my life, my car got repo\\'d, and I\\'m too stupid to keep a job where I have to interact with people.\\n\\nI\\'m on meds that make me feel braindead and it impairs my memory and cognitive ability. I can\\'t even add in my head anymore. I kept up for the first 2 weeks of this semester, then I stopped going. I couldn\\'t get out of bed because of the suicidal thoughts, the anxiety, and the fatigue. It\\'s gotten a lot better, but I\\'m not convinced it won\\'t happen again.\\n\\nI can\\'t sign up for this next semester because I still owe $400 for the books I didn\\'t even use, and those were in my car when it got repo\\'d (tried calling to find out who took the car, nobody ever got back to me). When I spoke to Financial Aid, they told me \"yeah you can\\'t attend until you pay it back, sorry\".\\n\\nI feel like an utter failure. I took a gap year to get myself mentally together, and that obviously didn\\'t work. I\\'m going to be 20 and my life has got *worse*.\\n\\nI want to go to college. I want to succeed. My body and the ill part of my mind doesn\\'t want to cooperate. A major depression diagnosis killed so many of my dreams. I can never work in government. I\\'ve been depressed for most of my life. It never goes away.', 'I kinda regret the last ten years of my life  I am currently in graduate school, and I feel like it\\'s the worst decision I\\'ve ever made.\\n\\nThe most important things to me now are my healthy, happiness, tribe, and stability. Grad school takes away all of those things in all of the ways. WHOOOOOOOOOOPS\\n\\nThere were severe interpersonal issues (a lab mate had serious emotional and behavioral problems, made everyone scared/extremely uncomf, sent threatening emails detailing evil schemes...) that were never resolved in the two years I was in that first lab, no matter how many personnel I spoke to. I learned fast from my experiences and other student stories that grad students are \"slaves and don\\'t matter\", their words... I changed from PhD to the MS program, because I was soooo burnt out, but I wanted the previous two years to not be for nothing. I escaped the hostile lab and started all over in a different lab with a new project, new protocols, new people, new nuances, new everything.\\n\\nNow that graduation is within the year, it sucks that my summation of my overall experience is basically bitterness, disgust, resentment, disdain, disappointment, and debt. The tribulations squelched the joy and fulfillment of gaining knowledge and experiences. Don\\'t even get me started on how it\\'s not worth the money I\\'ll be spending years paying back.\\n\\nI think about how I could have had a real job for this last decade and made a sweet career for myself. When I graduate, in the life and times of \\'rona, the job market may be less than ideal.

I feel like I wasted my youth trying to become something great, but I became tired and kinda hopeless. (I\\'m leaving out a lot of self-development.) I was never suicidal before grad school, but I have been since I started (I have a therapist and support.\"It\\'s the *feeling* \\'I am so overwhelmed I just want this to end\\'\" as my therapist very well put it.)\\n\\nI am grateful I had the opportunity: the purpose of this post is to vent about how absolutely not worth it emotionally and psychologically (and ultimately physically) college is. Although, this fits into a bigger picture of not being able to get jobs without degrees now, inflation, etc., etc...\\n\\nTL;DR: I fucking hate grad school, why did I do this? Huge waste of health, time and money. Will I even get a job?', \"Feeling pretty screwed, not sure what to do. Alright, let me elaborate. Settle down, get cozy because I'm gonna need the info straight up and you're probably going to have to deal with me crying about it.\\n\\nI need options here. I was in Cal State Fullerton for about 3 years but had the worst depression I've had in my entire life. No friends, money, my girlfriend and only friend there broke up with me after about 2 years. Failed a large majority of my classes and my GPA is far below the rescue point. Brink of suicide, all of that\\n\\nMoved back home in San Diego, threw myself in to therapy for a last ditch option before I decided to jump off a bridge. Got really good help, got myself on some nice prescribed medication, and I have a stable minimum wage job and a decent amount of friends and support now.\\n\\nTook a couple of community college classes, didn't really do well in them either. TBH it's sorta hard to be motivated to do better when your track record is as bad as mine was. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. People say I'm smart but I just can't bring myself to care enough sometimes, I already feel like I'm crawling out of a 10 foot hole I dug myself.\\n\\nI talked to a college counselor for options. He was pretty straight with me: I can't really transfer to UCSD or SDSU with the GPA I have. I'd have to go to a CSU in the middle of literally nowhere, California. The kind of schools that literally beg students to join. The issue is, well. I'd be going back to the middle of nowhere, to be depressed and without the friends I've made. I wouldn't have the current job I have that at least pays.\\n\\nThe counselor told me my other option were schools like National University, or University of Phoenix. Basically accredited schools with horrible reputations for being degree mills anyways.\\n\\nThe other sitch is my fucking health insurance is gonna go out if I'm not in school. And THAT is where the fear is really drawn out. No more meds and no more of my current therapist will send me in to a state of disarray that I'm not confident to tackle. My therapist says she wants to work with me still and is going to try to work some things out so we can continue seeing each other even if the worst comes, but her current advice is to look in to the aforementioned schools so I can keep my health insurance with my parents, and also to find a better job in San Diego.\\n\\nI just don't think I'd care to go to a school who's degree is worthless anyways. I'm a CS major, if that helps.\\n\\nJust wondering what some strangers think I should do.\", 'Should I not do college?? This is a weird situation for me because I really don’t know where everything is going anymore.\\n\\nSo I’m a music major at a community college, hoping to transfer to a higher up music university— and It’s only been three weeks and I’m ready to start crying. It’s not even my major classes, it’s my liberal arts math class.\\n\\nI know the content already because I’ve learned it already in high school— but I just flunked a quiz i’m pretty sure and I know I can’t get an A in the class anymore.\\n\\nI walk into the class— realize I don’t have my homework because I didn’t take a picture of the new syllabus he put on the screen, and I don’t even know what i’m turning in. Panic ensues, I have terrible anxiety and I couldn’t focus on anything for the first ten minutes of class. He passes out our quizzes and then he calls me out in front of the entire class and asks me why I don’t have my homework in, and I’m ready to just cry at that point. I say I just don’t have it, and he gives a snarl and just disappointment back and at that point I just wanted to die. I’ve been suicidal in the past and that’s just one thing that really hit me. I couldn’t focus on my quiz even though I knew all of the content, I’m missing a homework assignment that I cannot makeup. And the highest I’ll ever get in that math class is a B, if I can still muster up effort.\\n\\n\\nI walked to the bus stop, went home, didn’t even go to my second class, and just cried on my bed. Maybe it’s overreacting, but I don’t think I can handle this. It really did feel like I was thrown into college by my family and just everything that’s happened recently in life and I’m not even doing college for me at this point.\\n\\nAlso I definitely was putting myself in danger because of my depression after that, and I kept stopping in the middle of crosswalks because I wanted to get hit right then and there. This isn’t healthy for me and I’m terrified it’s going to happen again from the same class or from a different class and I hate how I can’t cope with this shit normally and just go on with my day.', \"Still bitter and depressed but won't quit TL:DR: High-performing high school student. Got rejected by almost every school. Fell into a depression that killed the chances of a transfer. Still bitter and upset at the derailing of my life plan. Hopefully will finally get back on track by getting into grad school. Sorry for being a douchey downer. \\n\\nHello all.\\n\\nI don't really have a good reason for posting about this and I'm sure it'll come off as a pity party (I suppose it actually is one) but I'm feeling sad again and don't have anything to take my mind off it. All my life I'd been told I'd get into any school I wanted, that I was a genius, how jealous people were that I could skate by classes. I really thought I'd get into a great school and be put on the path towards the only job I've ever wanted in my entire life: POTUS.\\n\\nI'm a first-gen American and college student so I didn't really know anything about the process. I took my first LSAT in June of my junior year, panic took the subject tests which I bombed (probably part of why I did poorly) and took an ACT in November of my senior year. I ended up doing well on the SAT and ACT, with a 1490 and 34. I had a good GPA, not great: 3.7. I had good extracurriculars, including a focus in the arts. I passed 10 AP tests, including a self-study. At worst, I thought I'd get into a T25 undergrad.\\n\\nLooking back on it, when I was applying for schools I was grossly misinformed because of my background. I didn't even realize majoring in Business was popular. I thought because MBAs exist, everyone just went to Business school instead. I ended up picking a major at random because I was good at Math and it seemed interesting. That ended up being a huge mistake as it turns out, I despised the culture of the students. I only really knew about the schools that I'd read about or heard of from books and movies, like Harvard or Stanford.\\n\\nI remember that my parents actually paid for a meeting with an admissions guide who told me I wouldn't get in where I wanted. I thought he was such a pompous asshole but he turned out to be the Oracle of Delphi in disguise.\\n\\nI applied to 11 schools, including many where I was over the 75% percentile of their GPA and SAT/ACT. As people's acceptances started rolling through, I saw more and more of my peers get into their dream schools. Not to be an asshole, but some of them I'd shared classrooms with and was a little surprised to hear of their outcomes. Nonetheless, I patiently waited, expecting to be put on the path toward my dreams. Then something I never would have expected in a million years happened.\\n\\nI got rejected by almost every single school I applied to. I can still feel the shame and pain reading the emails brought me. Sometimes I still tear up when I think about it or hear about other people getting into awesome schools. I was left with the choice of a mediocre (putting it nicely) commuter state school and a bad large public school (without a lot of money). I only got waitlisted by one school, one where before all of this happened I thought I'd never have to even consider. I didn't even get off of their list.\\n\\nI cried. I cried a lot. I got severely depressed to the point that, for the first time in my life, I just gave up. I stopped turning in schoolwork and stopped doing anything productive. I nearly flunked my senior year because of it (shoutout to some amazing teachers who let me turn in work late).\\n\\nI started to suffer from passive suicidal ideation as I realized that my dreams were essentially dead. There's a saying that an athlete dies twice: once when they can no longer play their sport and a second when they actually pass. It feels like I died when that last rejection came. I'm a husk of that person. I can't even imagine what my younger self would have said if he'd seen what we'd end up as. He'd be so fucking upset and it breaks my heart to think of how pathetic I look.\\n\\nI'm sure I can guess what some of you are asking: why would you panic? Why not just transfer. Because of my AP credits, I started with nearly 53 units. I thought this meant I wasn't allowed to transfer which then caused me to torpedo my entire first year of my college. By the time I found out that I could transfer, the damage was done. I had <3.0 GPA for the first time in my life. There was no way that I'd be able to get into a good school.\", 'Ya know I wish I studied art (Sorry this is a long one)I started college off as Neuroscience Pre-med major. Why? Because when I was in high school, all I was ever told was that art will never make you money. You’ll be broke and unhappy and need to work at McDonalds just to get by with a degree that won’t pay the bills. Your better off if you choose a major that will make a 6 figure salary. \\n\\nSo I did. I was hoping to use my Neuroscience degree to go to med school and study to be a psychiatrist, because I love the studying the human psyche. It’s just so incredibly interesting, so I figured hell why not? It’ll make me 100k or more and I’ll be doing something cool. But then I started on this pre-med track and almost killed myself. I slaved away for an entire year only to get to my spring semester and wonder if I should just drop out. I was completely unhappy, and taking a bunch of class just so that I could be qualified enough to pass the MCAT. Yet if you asked me if I even remember what I studied the answer would be “NO”. I had migraines for the first time ever, I had ludicrous back pain from all the expectations I placed on myself, and I’ve never cried more in one year than I have in my whole life. So I remembered my life goals and realized that “hey all I want to do own my cafe one day, what am I doing Neuroscience even for?” And then I changed my major.\\n\\nBut I then figured changing it to Finance and International Business would get me the foot in the door to owning my cafe and making me 100k plus as a bonus. So I started on this business track as a double major and you know what happened? I was incredibly unhappy again. At this point in my life, death truly was a plausible option. I figured if life was so hard, why not just die? Wouldn’t that be easier? Life isn’t that awesome that I need to live, I couldn’t give a damn frankly. I just couldn’t figure out what was going wrong.\\n\\nWhat’s ironic was that this whole time I was doing art, drawing like a madman. It was the only escape I had from the endless slew of classes that I hated. I was attempting to draw my own manga, because I love creating stories and have before. And like before, I thought “hey, why are you even a business major? You don’t need a business degree to own a business” and I was fucking furious with myself. I went on Reddit and found people disproving my expectation of art not being a plausible degree option. I found people saying you don’t even need a 6 figure salary to live comfortably. SO WHAT THE HELL WAS I DOING?\\n\\nYet before I knew it, a year and half had passed and I had learned so much to amount to so little. Now I’m struggling with financial aid since I’ve failed another class, and I’ve had to be reinstated. My graduation date is 2 extra years out from when I was supposed to graduate. And I sit back and wonder “what if I started with art to begin with?” Would my life be so full of exhausting reminders of my mistakes? \\n\\nI decided to go into a more creative field, and no, not a fine art degree. Due to the fact that I don’t want to fully major in art, as despite living drawing and creating, I don’t do it often enough to want to make a degree out of it. I feel as though if I did that, I’d come to hate doing art. Therefore I chose another degree that utilizes art in a field that I’ve always found fascinating. I’m in between being a Landscape Architecture major, and Interior Design major, or an Architecture major. \\n\\nWhy? Because, I like to change things. I love creating spaces, ever since I was forced to learn how to draw a cube in elementary school. I love asking myself “how different could I make something fit in this space?”. Traditionalism is lost on me, and I like to challenge the idea of sameness. Why leave something as is when it can be different and potentially better?(*⁰▿⁰*)\\n\\nSo despite my financial trouble with the school for me trying to make up for my past mistakes that I’ve made in the last year and half of my life, my only regret is not starting with art. But I hate having regrets so I’m going to try and make up for these mistakes and actually do what I want to do. So maybe that this last year and half doesn’t serve as a reminder to my failures, depression, and suicidal ideation, cuz man what an exhausting year it was.\\n\\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk and hell of anyone sees this, maybe we could chat about your experiences if you could relate to this.(￣▽￣)\\n\\nTL;DR: this is an entire post about why I didn’t chose art as my first major in college and wasted a year and half of my life and how I’m now attempting to make up for my mistakes.', 'Suffering Through Spring Semester I\\'m a senior in an esteemed private university in my state.

My doctor doesn\\'t believe me either. \\n\\nI just want to focus. I want to be able to manage my time without having to constantly focus on the clock. And don\\'t get me started on what my counselor assumes is C-PTSD, which causes nightmares so bad I\\'m afraid to sleep some nights. This spring break, I was supposed to catch up on all of my work, but instead, I\\'ve been unable to actually get myself to do anything because I\\'m too tired and can\\'t focus at all. My mental health is on a sharp decline. Just last semester, I got so bad that I drafted up a suicide plan, and though I\\'m not nearly as bad this semester, I want to scream. I can\\'t keep up with this workload. And I\\'ve missed so much class already that if I miss more, I\\'ll start dropping grade levels. I can\\'t get any accommodations because I don\\'t have a diagnosis for anything because my doctor thinks I\\'m pretty much just hysterical. I thought I was hearing voices the other week, but it turns out it was just my drug addict neighbor and his girlfriend shouting at all hours (I\\'m hard of hearing, so I can\\'t figure out what direction sound comes from, and it was happening nearly around the clock, so I thought I was fucking crazy). I don\\'t think my anxiety meds are working anymore. When I visit my doctor on Friday, he\\'s going to chastise me for *giving into my agoraphobia* for being too depressed/anxious/fucking poor to leave the house often and adjust my meds, so more insomnia for me, right ahead of academic conference season, where I\\'m attending two conferences in as many weeks and missing two weeks of class, out of state for both, so I was *supposed* to catch up on work this week and work ahead for the weeks I\\'m missing, but that didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nGas is $4, I drive a shitty car from the 90s that costs $40 to fill up the entire tank when gas is at a *good* price, and I live 30 minutes from my university. My laptop is so broken that my mic doesn\\'t work anymore, so distance learning isn\\'t a good idea for me since I can\\'t participate in class discussions. My  Sunday D&D group won\\'t tell me if we have our session tomorrow or not, and I feel like shit if I miss a session because I\\'m one of the only people who roleplays, and my Monday D&D group is canceled because my best friend/DM is out of the country on a trip for class. Everything is so much all the time right now and I can\\'t even think about how I\\'m going to be entering the job market as an underqualified recent graduate in May. My husband, bless him, helps, but he has chronic pain and regularly gets injured at his job, and he can\\'t drive, so *I* have to drive him to and from work and the doctor for when he gets hurt. If I don\\'t graduate this semester, that\\'s another $40,000+ to my university, and we can\\'t afford that. My main support professor is super busy right now, and I don\\'t want to bother any other professors, since it\\'s midterms, and I\\'m a grown-ass man. I should be able to handle myself. I graduated from high school with my Associate\\'s, for fuck\\'s sake, and I can\\'t handle my senior year? Really? When I was a senior in high school, I was so sick I couldn\\'t eat, I worked at least 30 hours a week, and I was in marching band on top of it, and that was before the pandemic began, where I worked almost 40 hours a week and closed for Subway. Now I\\'m getting sick again. Really sick. I can\\'t bring myself to eat anymore, and anyways, we can barely afford to eat because of all of my life-threatening allergies and how much food my husband eats. My face is starting to sink in like it did my last senior year. I have to drink so much caffeine to even be able to focus for a brief amount of time that it makes my entire body shake. \\n\\nI feel completely useless and broken. My brain is refusing to work, my body is shutting down, and I can\\'t even escape in my dreams because I only dream about my childhood beatings. The only time I can relax is when my husband is holding me or I\\'m writing (Creative Writing major). I\\'m a disappointment of a student and a husband, and I just want to curl up beneath my bed and die like the animal I am. I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I\\'ve exhausted every avenue I\\'ve tried. I\\'m sorry if this reads as too \"woe is me\". I\\'m just suffering really badly right now and I don\\'t know if I can handle it anymore.', 'I\\'m very lonely even tho I try everything to get friends on the campus 😭 Edit : I MAYBE HAVE SOME [POSITIVE NEWS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/pqvom5/update_im_very_lonely_even_tho_i_try_everything/)!!! YAAAY! 🥰🥰🥰\\n\\nSome of you describe it something that\\'s easy. Well maybe it is when you already have the skill for it. But for now, I try to do everything to get friends but I didn\\'t find them yet.\\n\\nSometimes even finding the places where you can socialise can be difficult. Especially when you didn\\'t do it that much before and there\\'s no easy method that you know of. I wish how to socialise would be taught at school.\\n\\nHere\\'s the issues : First, I\\'m autistic and so it\\'s sometimes harder to communicate. Second, I\\'m at a place where I don\\'t know any \"student associations\". I don\\'t live in the US, and at the college style called \"DUT\" in France, here\\'s how it works : while I\\'m in a campus, I\\'m also basically always only next to the people of my own education, programming.\\n\\nThere\\'s like 200 students at programming. Not that much. They\\'re basically classmates. I actually do talk to them and with some I actually make some small groups where we talk together during the recess time. But most of them are kinda occupied outside of school or just don\\'t want to hang out and so I can\\'t become real friends with them in real life.\\n\\nThere is a campus but yeah during recess we only talk to the people of the same department. There\\'s no place for anyone to hang out. At least not one where my classmates went. There are the places where the people of other departments who study other things go. But they\\'re usually in groups of friends and I think it\\'d be weird if I approached someone and tried to become a friend. I even tried, but like I\\'ve never seen them again. And it\\'s a shame that for now I only talk to people from my department because it looks like it\\'d be cool to talk to a more diverse range of people. For example there\\'s almost no girls in my department and I would like more gal friends.\\n\\nI don\\'t really know if in all of the campus there\\'s any such student activities. At best there\\'s online activist groups. I\\'ve never heard about any of that. Maybe I\\'ll try to ask more but I\\'d be surpsided if there are. I mean there\\'s a library but that\\'s about it. And also even if there were, when would the students evcen go there? Going on the campus on the weekend when we want to be finally rest after school? Or at 6PM when we also have 1 hour to commute? Idk, but unfortunately my college isn\\'t some Hogwards fairytale. Actually, because of my loneliness it feels like a nightmare.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s not at all better outside of school. yeah I don\\'t go at any activities like sports yet, and I\\'ll try that. But honestly what if I won\\'t like the activity? It has been hard finding a place for socialising with people of similar interest of me. Should I go to an activity where I won\\'t understand anything just for socialising? And also I don\\'t drink and don\\'t really know how to socialise at bars or cafes either.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s also way harder when this loneliness has alreasy been a big problem of mine during the summer holidays, but now it all didn\\'t become better, but actually worse because now I have to think of all that stressful, very anxious and extremely difficult actual LESSONS and I have 8 hours a day of them! So I have way less time for even trying to socialise with my already existing classmates. And it\\'s also harder when BECAUSE of the lessons I have less time, I become more irritated and visibly anxious and it\\'s even LESS possible to become friends with the people I already know (Last year, I even had a problem where I started ranting about some stupid political shit because of that)!\\n\\nI also don\\'t really like my lessons even tho I thought I\\'d like programming too, but that\\'s too complicated to explain here.\\n\\nTL;DR : I try everything to find friends but usual advice haven\\'t worked for me, at least yet, It\\'s not that easy and I don\\'t have that much practise :(\\n\\nHonestly, my life just seems the worst that it could be! 😢 I just hate everything and honestly sometimes I even have suicidal thoughts but often I dream of just never ever studying in my life ever again! Or at least to finally be happy and actually hang out with someone 😭', 'Am I being stupid? **TL;DR College is the biggest waste of fucking time unless it\\'s fun, free, and you\\'re deadset on making money off of what you\\'re learning. Also American Society has set an entire generation up for failure.**\\n\\nBeing totally honest here if my tuition wasn\\'t paid for by Bright Futures I wouldn\\'t have even bothered with this bullshit. Florida education is only good for one thing... getting a job in Florida.\\n\\nWhen I was applying to Uni\\'s I was pretty much told \"I ain\\'t paying, you better get that scholarship\" by my single mother, so I ended up going to a shitty commuter school 40 min away from my house. She refuses to file the FAFSA cause she\\'s kind of batshit crazy (still love her tho). Going in I had no clue wtf I wanted to do. I ended up changing majors 4 times, starting with Computer Science to Biology to Psychology to Business Analytics and finally settling on Management Information Systems. Now going into my 4th year with 12 classes left which I\\'ll probably finish in 2 more years (5 years total in college) cause that\\'s how long my scholarship\\'ll be good for + it\\'s easier, don\\'t really care that much since I\\'ll still be graduating at 22.\\n\\nPoint is I fucking hate it here, I don\\'t spend much time on campus because\\n\\n* A. I just wanna go home or somewhere else, after class I always feel like I\\'ve spent too much time there\\n* B. It\\'s a shitty Florida University that doesn\\'t even have a football team (Every single U.S. University pumps most of their budget into their Sports teams. Considering that this is a Florida university we\\'re talking about that speaks volumes about the quality of education I\\'m receiving)\\n* C. I\\'ve always felt like I could\\'ve gone somewhere better If I went into more debt. Would\\'ve been a stupid idea considering how much I think College is a scam but ik it would\\'ve made a more enjoyable college experience.\\n\\nCause of my lack of campus involvement and a good amount of virtual classes (cause why waste gas driving 40 min to and back) I\\'ve pretty much made 0 friends here. I still hang out with homies from HS and some other peeps, but I literally have no incentive to go out of my way to talk to people. The clubs are also shit too, not much variety. Also doesn\\'t help that I see a lot of people I went to Highschool with, kinda makes the experience feel even more lame. The worst part is not only do these fucking vampires force most people into debt, they make us VOLUNTEER on top of it. Imagine being someone that takes out $6000+ in loans a year for a bullshit education along with working a job to pay rent while also being forced to do over 100 hours of volunteer work like you\\'re still in highschool. The real kicker here is that you\\'re not even guaranteed a job once you graduate, only 50% of graduates are employed. That just shows how much the boomers have leeched our opportunities, only 13% of those old retards went to college and they made more money in their prime than Millenial and Gen Z combined. This shit should be free. Paid for by the tax money that goes to the Military industrial Complex and Israel instead of the American People. If you don\\'t support free college you could say the same shit about Highschool, which BTW a College degree now is the same thing a Highschool degree was back in the 60\\'s and 70\\'s (back when it cost almost nothing). Too bad we live in an Oligarchy where politicians would rather give tax cuts to their corporate donors instead of giving us Healthcare.\\n\\nNow you may be wondering \"Why aren\\'t you taking advantage of campus networking?\" Well because I honestly don\\'t give two shits about my education. My reason for going to college was 50% parental pressure (Angry Cuban Father (who died when I was 12) was a dentist with an Ivy League degree and my mom has a bachelors in Bus. administration) and the other 50% me thinking It\\'d be stupid to skip out on the 100% free tuition I got for getting a 30 on my ACT.\\n\\nWere it up to me I would\\'ve majored in History. I\\'d actually feel engaged with what I\\'m learning + my biggest strength has always been writing. Why didn\\'t I do that? Waste of a scholarship. There\\'s two types of degrees: Degrees that force you into becoming a k-12 teacher or \"Job Training\" degrees that can get you a decent paying job (Engineering + Business). That being said I actually like learning about the Business world a lot, the information system aspect not so much. But the Truth is I don\\'t see myself making a career out of this degree at all. Fuck graduate school too as Sam Hyde once said \"Thats the loser route\", a massively expensive time waster. I\\'ve always hated school, why tf would I want more of it? I\\'d just wanna make money at that point.\\n\\nI believe in this life we either follow our dreams or we live out our lifespan. Working as a Systems Engineer sounds fucking boring. If I\\'m still having to write job applications in my mid 30\\'s that\\'s a big sign I didn\\'t work hard enough on my goals when I had youth. The 9-5 is Creative Suicide, fuck real jobs (btw before any of you call me lazy I worked retail from Sophomore to Junior year on top of taking 12 credits per semester, I HATED that shit XD ). In an ideal world I\\'m some famous Hideo Kojima guy who\\'s created a badass IP with comics, video games, anime, tabletop rpg\\'s, etc. (We\\'ll have to see how that turns out lol)\\n\\nI\\'ll probably work a job or two given by my degree (has to at least be 70k salary), until I have enough money to start working on my actual dreams. Who knows if Florida\\'s the right place for that though, opportunities and getting the right people to work with is all location dependent.\\n\\nBottomline is I think I\\'ve wasted a good 3 years of my life, going on 4.5 to 5 in the near future. College is what you make of it, and personally I haven\\'t made jack shit. Why? Cause it really wasn\\'t for me. Also let\\'s be real here EVERY single thing you learn in college could be learned online or through books, even better if you find the right person who can teach you the skills necessary to follow your dreams. MENTORS > COLLEGE. A burden will be lifted off my shoulders once I graduate, I\\'ll probably have more time for personal endeavors. Hopefully whatever job my degree gives me doesn\\'t completely suck that away from me. All I am is just a young horny man with Hopes and Dreams.', 'no idea what im doing with myself 2nd year of college, only took two classes this semester, now im going to have to go to community college. Dont get me wrong, its not like CC is fucking bad or something, but the reason why my parents are making me go isnt even bc they\\'re assholes or whatever, i am for a fact, part of the fucking problem. i guess for preface, last year as freshman, do decently first semester, get girlfriend, fall genuinely in love with her, cool. next semester, 3 weeks in, she breaks it off, and tht fucking launches my not-too-bad-depression of 5 years into fuckin hyperdrive. stop attending classes. literally want to fucking die, hate my self, and bc im obviously failing the fuck out of my classes, fucking spirals even harder. tips to the point where i tried to hang myself twice right before spring break, cus no way did I want to go home (really fucking hate being at home, when i was a kid id always get into huge blowout fights with them literally at least twice a week. my parents and i never fucking resolved our issues, so while we love eachother, i cant stand being with them, or near them. I hate living at home and i would unironically rather live and die on the fucking street. everytime i hop into my car, i pray to god i die in a car accident; i consider myself to be a religious person as well. just trying to give u the scope of how much i hate homelife.) so i spend me whole second semester in my room, fucking boiling in my on self hatred and despair and whatever the fuck, gain a literal 40 fucking pounds, and the finally fucking go home for the summer. U know i try my goddamned hardest to avoid the conversation of grades, until finally, the letter comes. Hey, ur kid fucked up. Fuck. finally tell them about everything thts been going on, even the suicide attempts, bc at this point i dont give a fuck about anything or anyone. if u cant tell from earlier, i NEVER talk to my parents about anything of substance. and being the fucking asian \"boomers\" they are (my fellow yellows know wht i mean) they dont understand shit, and just make fun of me for trying to kill myself. dont get me wrong, i fully fucking expected that, but tht shit still hurt. They didnt give a fuck. about a week goes by, not muhc happening, and then my fucking dad just starts shitting on me, for wanting and imma quote exactly what i said, \"\\\\[wanting\\\\] to be alone sometimes.\" he literally responded with \"SO YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST FORGET AND ABANDON YOUR FUCKING FAMILY LIKE THAT?!?\" what the fuck? i just wanted to be left alone sometimes? which means i want to jsut forget my fucking family? the fuck kind of bullshit? anyways. ive had fucking enough. text my best freind (who didnt know until i texted her, and i broke her heart in a fight the day before my ex brokeup with me) im done, as a last favor, treat yourself right (cus boy, she has hella issues. not tht im judging lmao). she calls the fucking cops, who wheel me away in an ambulance. spend the night in a hospital, before spending the next ten days in a fucking mental institution. place gave me some perspective, and FINALLY after (at the time) 19 years, i finally fucking told my parents how EXACTLY i feel, how much i fucking HATE my father, etc etc, all the edgy shit.  fast forward fall of 2019, taking 2 classes bc everyone knows academically i am not even close to ready to being full time again. do pretty decently in the beggining, get a dog for the first time (whom i love beyond fucking reality), kindof mend my relationship with my parents, and then right before christmas, meet this nice girl, and now were dating very casually (im genuinely afraid that ill fall in love with her like the last one then have my heart broken again. breaking up amicably is one thing, but to just be cut away is pretty fucking terrible.) and now, ive gotten C\\'s in those two classes, which, yea, not good, but still. so now, my options are to fund my broke, out of work ass, or go to CC. again, I aint bashing CC, im fucking going lol. been back on tht fuckin spiral since this winter break started, and honestly back to having an incredibly powerful death wish. only dont wanna die cus i cant do my dog dirty like that, or my gf. fuckingfuck dudes. it feels marginally fucking better to physically type this shit out. sorry this shit is long as hell. have a good semester guys.', 'I am deformed and disgusting I am deformed and disgusting\\n\\nLol I don’t even know where to start...\\nI’m an 18 year old freshman in college with issues you’ve never heard of. I need to get this off my chest and I have have no one to talk to bc no one else has to deal with this shit. \\n\\nPlease feel free to message me if you’ve dealt with some of the same things or something similar!💕\\n\\nI have tuberous breasts which is a congenital deformity where one’s breasts do not develop correctly. It may not seem like a big deal but it has made me consider suicide on multiple occasions and I suffer mentally every second of every day. I got a breast augmentation a few months ago but I still feel worthless because I had to have plastic surgery in order to look somewhat normal. I will never be considered naturally pretty and I hate myself more than anything for it. I got into an argument with my friend a few weeks ago. She told me to “have fun with my fake tits” she’s one of the only people that knows I’ve had surgery and I will remember what she said for the rest of my life. I also had enlarged labia but I had a labiaplastay (when they cut off your labia minora) because it made me extremely insecure in intimate situations. My doctor ended up fucking it up so now I have to get a revision surgery. Every guy I’ve been intimate with has stopped talking to me after we had sex and I’m convinced it’s because of the way I look. I’ve had guy friends make jokes about girls with “roast beef pussies” and I know that the guys I’ve had sex with thought the same way even though they never directly said anything to me. I also had a really bad eating disorder that resulted in me being placed in a residential facility for one month and two months of outpatient treatment. I was called fat in middle school and decided to lose weight. I also wanted to be really skinny so it would “balance out” the fact that I’m deformed. I hoped that boys would think “alright she may be ugly as fuck but at least she’s skinny.” I felt like I needed to punish myself by taking laxatives and not eating because my boobs and vagina were ugly. I also punished myself when guys stopped talking to me out of nowhere. I would starve myself for days, take up to 40 laxatives, and cut myself. I still feel the need to punish myself because all I am is a fake ass bitch who’s had plastic surgery. I don’t take it to the extent I did before going to treatment because I thought I was legitimately going to die from taking laxatives when I took about 40. Every.single.day all I can think about is how deformed and fat I am. I’m 115 pounds and 5’5. You may not think I seem fat but I can 100% assure you that you’d want to puke if you saw me without clothes on. People probably can’t tell I’m disgusting when I have clothes on but when I don’t you can tell that I have a lot of stomach fat and that there’s scars under my boobs. I have given up on ever finding love because no one wants to date someone who is deformed. They also don’t want to date anyone who is fake (had plastic surgery) so basically I’m screwed either way. People tell me I’m pretty and I hate them because I know they’re only saying it to make me feel better. Since I’m never going to find love I’ve decided that all my time and energy needs to be focused on school so I can have a successful career after college which will give me some sense of worth. This leads to me feeling extremely stressed about school and I feel worthless when I get bad grades. I joined a sorority and I hate it because I feel so fat compared to other girls and they all brag about how they’ve fucked 7 dudes since coming to college. It makes me sad because even though I don’t want to go out and have sex with a bunch of guys, I still want them to want to have sex with me. It’s weird, I know. I’ve been dealing with this stuff ever since I hit puberty and it has RUINED my life. I want to die because of the way I look. Sometimes, I wish it worked when I previously tried to kill myself because I wouldn’t have to deal with this. If you saw me you’d think I was just a typical college girl having “fun” doing sorority shit but no one actually knows what’s going on.', 'I\\'m getting kicked out of my program.  Hi everyone this is a gentle rant and also a cry for help/advice.\\n\\nI have been at my university majoring in Mechanical Engineering for 3 years now. Prior to that, I was in an early college high school where I was able to attend college in the mornings and high school in the afternoons. On top of that, I was doing a certification in Composite Material Technology at my local trade college. So what I am getting at is I was a badass in high school. I graduated with a Trade School Certification and an Associates degree before I got my high school diploma. I did really well. I have always done really well.\\n\\nFast forward to the Mechanical Engineering program and I have endured a lot of mental health challenges, most are courtesy to my toxic ex. I had failed 2 classes before this last fall semester. In the Fall of 2019, I sought help from the Disability Resource Center at my school after a suicide attempt. Which ended up being no help at all because I still failed the class they gave me an extension on because the pandemic hit and I was on my own to finish the class that I was struggling in even with help!\\n\\nThis last semester, I failed 3 classes. THREE CLASSES. My grandfather passed away so that put me out for a few weeks. My professors gave me extensions but it was still hard to focus after that. Then a month before finals, my eye doctor finally found my blindspot that I went to him for over a year ago. Everyone there told me not to worry when I went in all that time ago, and then they found it, and they were not shy about showing me how concerned they were about it. Aren\\'t doctors supposed to be discreet until they have answers? My doctor really said \"we can finally see your blindspot. You probably have glaucoma, a stroke, or there might be something wrong with your brain.\" So for the next month, all I could think about is that I might have a fucking brain tumor. This obviously caused my performance to fucking tank and I was not getting any sleep. Constantly pulling all-nighters because I was too anxious to fall asleep because I had unfinished work to do, but I was too anxious to do anything about it because I felt that I had bigger things to worry about. It was an endless cycle of worry.\\n\\nThen THE WEEK OF FINALS, I had my followup appointment and he found deteriation of my optic nerve and said \"I am suspecting that it is Multiple Sclerosis. We are going to order an MRI so we can see if you have it.\" My dad was livid with this news and the way he delivered it and immediately got me in with a new doctor at our actual clinic the following day, again, the week of finals. This new doctor agreed with us that this doctor should not have said the things he said the way he said it and tried to calm me down a bit.\\n\\nAnyways, fast forward and I\\'m still figuring things out. I thought I would be fine with school because I was under the impression that I could retake a class 3 times, not that I had a limit of 3 retakes in the pre-professional program. I got an email today saying I need to change my major. I\\'ve been crying all morning and running around trying to gather reasons and proof for my poor performance this last semester. It was hard enough as it was and then I had all these other things stacked on top of it. I submitted an appeal and I am waiting for documentation from my doctors. Now all I can do is wait. I have GI Bill Benefits that my dad passed down to me and if I get kicked out I don\\'t know how I can even go to school at all next semester. I am also double majoring in Physics so I can fall back on that, but none of the classes I can take next are offered in the spring. I have a housing contract I need paid for because I live on campus so if I am not awarded the GI Bill, then I am so screwed.\\n\\nHave any of you been kicked out of your program and appealed it successfully? If they approve my appeal, then the F\\'s will be changed to W\\'s and I will be able to retake them without a problem. If not... my entire life long dream of becoming an engineer is down the drain because I don\\'t even know if I could get into another university with the GPA I have right now. Did I mention that the semester starts in a week? They told me this a week before. I have been out of school for a month now and they decide to inform me now... which in all honesty it was my responsibility to know what they meant about \"3 retakes\" and realize that they would kick me out, but my advisor has never been clear about it and I got my idea of it from fellow ME students who obviously are also confused about that requirement.\\n\\nPlease tell me you all think this is reason enough to get my appeal approved... I like to think that they do this so they can tell if I just gave up on school and am wasting my time, or if I genuinely care and have relevant reasons as to why I have not been doing so hot. I really hope this is enough... I have been questioning my path in engineering and this is all making me realize that I don\\'t know what I would do without it. It has been my passion for so long and I really want this to work out. If it does, this will definitely be my wake-up call, but if it doesn\\'t, I am stuck. I love my school and I love my major and I just really hope it works out):', 'Dear favorite professor \\n***Edit: I’m not actually going to send this!!!!\\n\\nI’m finally letting go. Sorry it took this long. You don’t have to worry about me bothering you ever again. \\n\\nI’m sorry if I have made your life worse these past four years. I’m sorry if I have uncomfortable, if I have annoyed you, bored you, scared you. It seems like that’s all I do these days. You are always polite and good to me but, lately, whenever I speak with you I feel like you can’t wait to get away from me. Do you dread talking to me? Yesterday it seemed like it. I hadn’t spoken to you in person in over a year, and you are my advisor. I try hard to always give you an “out,” to be respectful of your time, to look for cues that you are bored. \\n\\nThere was a time when I thought you really liked talking to me. You even told me once “I like talking to you.” You always pointed out all the ways we were similar and others could see it too. You said you saw your younger self in me, you counseled and comforted me. You teased me in class and smiled wide when you saw me in the halls, and I did the same back to you. We talked about music and philosophy. You encouraged me to submit my papers to prize committees. \\n\\nYou told me it was nice to have me in class, because I was the only one who would talk sometimes and you hated silences. I always laughed at your jokes even when the others didn’t, and you always tended to look right at me when you lectured, probably because I was listening so attentively. \\n\\nI always did all the readings, and asked questions about them after class. I worked so hard on my papers. I got into a program at Oxford (the same one you went to) because of your recommendation, but then lost my spot because I failed my classes (were you disappointed, think less of me, after everything you did for me? I bet.)  You suggested books for me to read and I read them and we discussed them. You seemed to like doing this. You seemed to be grateful and happy. You initiated full blown conversations with me when you saw me outside of class (now you seem uncomfortable and eager to get away from me before I start talking). \\n\\nYou were the best thing that has ever happened to me. I’ve never admired or liked being around anyone more than you. You understood me it seemed in a way no one else did, despite being 30 years older than me. You said I couldn’t ever shock or scare you, when I apologized for confiding in you about my bipolar disorder. You said you had many bipolar friends throughout the years. You said “sometimes very smart people have very hard times.” \\n\\nA year later, I took another class with you and when I stopped turning in work you got concerned and contacted the Dean. I was doing badly, having flashbacks to my childhood sexual abuse at the time. I didn’t want to use it as an excuse but I wanted you to know. I should never have told you but I confided in you about my my sexual abuse. It felt so good. I had t told anyone at that point. But then it felt bad. I think I went to far. I didn’t ask for any extensions or any special assistance or comfort but I should never have told you. You didn’t need to know. I’m sorry. Maybe that’s when things really started to change. \\n\\nI did poorly in your class and other classes. I struggled and acted weird around you I think. I tried to avoid you for a few months. I became suicidal. I stopped going to classes. I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days during the middle of the semester. You found out. Everyone in found out. I tried to get things back to normal. I tried to get your attention back. \\n\\nNow you seem to try and avoid me. It’s subtle but I can tell. You are nice and polite to me still but your voice is flat and dry. Your laugh is fake. You literally check your email when I am talking to you. Your answers are short. I know I shouldn’t expect so much from you and I don’t expect it. Still, I desire it. Why do I try so hard to get it back when it’s clearly gone? Im very sorry. \\n\\nI really try hard to not be a bother. I really thought you genuinely enjoyed me, a bit, and wanted to talk but I need to let it go. My enthusiasm, my excitement about the subject, about literature no longer makes you want to share with me. It seems to irritate you. I will give up. It’s a losing battle. I’m a pathetic puppy dog. You probably think I want to end your marriage or something. I swear I don’t. If anything I want you to invite me to your house for a board game or something. I’m so lonely without a family. But that’s not your problem. Obviously. \\n\\nAnyway, I need to give up trying to get back the mentor mentee relationship we had. It was the most amazing and intense and beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced in 24 years and I’m sad it ended and I’m extremely angry with myself for ruining it. At least I hope I ruined it. The alternative is that it was never there to begin with. I’ll stick with the story that I ruined it. And I know things used to be different. I know something changed. I think I creeped you out. Showed too much interest. Hell, at one point I even told you I was worried I was getting “too attached” and needed to stop taking classes with you. Now I ruined everything. You probably think I’m a stalker. Not too mention I became dumber and less interesting. I’m grasping at straws now, trying to be smarter, more interesting, more appealing, more stylish (you always cared about fashion and aesthetics) just to get your attention back. I need to give up. You clearly dislike me and don’t want to talk to me. Im sure you wish you didn’t have to advise me. I’m so sorry. \\n\\nI asked your colleague, your good friend (a female), if I was crossing any boundaries or annoying you in any way and they said I was fine and that you only ever had good things to say about me and that they would let me know if I overstepped any boundaries. I told her I sometimes was bad at understanding etiquette and picking up on cues and boundaries, and she said she thought I was actually especially sensitive and attuned to those things, and in fact worried almost too much about bothering others. \\n\\nI hope she’s right but either way it’s clear you want little to do with me. There’s no going back. You have your own life. I am not entitled to anything more from you than a grade and support on my academics.', 'The Saga is ending I\\'ve been in higher education since I was fifteen. I am now 21 and so fucking done. I wanted to detail my journey in a rant here, and I really don\\'t mind if no one sees it. Its mostly for myself, honestly. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nStarting off as a young, fresh 15 year old girl. I hated high school/public school in general. I went to a school that prioritized sports over most other things (smalltown USA, amirite?) and I am the furthest thing from athletic I could be without being a literal lump of clay. I swam competitively for maybe four years for a rival school district but even then, I just was mediocre. I just didn\\'t fit. So after my freshman year of HS, I dropped out. My mom decided she\\'d home school me and send me to the local community college instead so that I could get a jump start on college. All fine and dandy,  yeah? Sure. why not? I started there and i had a blast for a while, got stalked for a semester and a half, lost my taste for the community college vibe and decided to load up on classes to finish high school credits and gtfo. \\n\\nI finished everything and I applied to a four year university (Bible college. not a great call on my part but it was my parents and I\\'s decision so of course it would be a bible college as they are christians). Left for there a month before I turned 18 and couldn\\'t have been happier. I was finally out of my shitty hometown, with like minded people who were just trying to learn and live life as freshly minted \"adults\". Tons of fun. But this school was very difficult. If I recall correctly, you needed a 94 or higher to earn an A, across the school, no exceptions. As well as that, you were required to minor in Bible and Theology. Which was fine, it ended up being interesting but also entirely not useful. I spent two years (ish) there and I only had to call a suicide hotline once! yay. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSummer of 2018 I was taking summer classes and decided I hated it and didn\\'t want to do it anymore. Much to the chagrin of my parents, I decided to drop from enrollment and take some time off. I\\'d not gotten a chance to decide what I wanted and I only knew I didn\\'t want to pursue a degree in Counseling and Therapy. So I took the summer off and worked a normal retail job. This was the most normal, all american summer I have ever had and probably will ever have in my life. I spent time hanging out at a friends pool, met my (now ex) boyfriend through a good friend and roommate and had so so much fun. Lost my virginity  at the tender age of 19, as well, which went better than expected and happened earlier than expected due to my conservative upbringing (again, much to the chagrin of my parents). After that summer, I took off a whole ass semester because I had no direction and would NOT be caught DEAD going back to that school. And then I decided to move back to my home state to finish my education and just get it over with. I thought it would be cheaper and faster. I was wrong. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis brings us to January of 2019. At this point, I had been doing higher level classes for four years and I still had a year and a half or more to go. I didn\\'t even know how much more I needed to graduate. I transferred to a state college two hours away from my hometown and realized that I would just need to put my head down and plow through the rest of this. I didn\\'t really have a choice. My parents wouldn\\'t have let me take more time off without pulling out of financially supporting me, so I had to do it. And I did. My first semester here was spent skipping nearly all my classes, letting my GPA drop from a 3.5 to a 2.2 and staying in bed almost all the time. I was depressed and stressed and I felt cornered. Like I had been tricked into something that was the last thing I\\'d choose for myself. And stuck as hell because I was NOT about to transfer AGAIN. I\\'d moved so much by this point (moved floors and dorms every single semester and got a new roommate every time. I\\'ve been through probably 13 or 14 of them by now and a solid 85 percent have sucked ass), that I was just gonna stick it out. That semester ended, I spent the summer back in TN with all my old friends and my boyfriend and then had to come back. That semester, I had more shitty roommates, almost died from alcohol poisoning (do NOT let anyone feed you shots. if you have friends who won\\'t stop giving them to you after you\\'re plastered, even if you ask for more, get new friends) and stayed lonely af. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMoved out of that apartment into a new one a little bit off campus (still covered by tuition tho) and that brings me to this semester. I\\'m ONE SEMESTER away from graduation. seven goddamn classes away. I\\'ve finished my major and all that\\'s left is to finish my minor. I would be done in May, but I had so many irrelevant bible classes from the last place that my minor is taking longer to finish than I had expected. I\\'m so fucking close, man. Five years of this shit and I can literally SEE the freedom. I apply for graduation in October, hopefully and will be finished in December. This year I have turned 21, I broke up with that boyfriend and managed to maintain a mature friendship with him, which has been nice. I adopted two wonderful little furballs (two guinea pigs names theodore and flynn) and I\\'ve made some good friends here finally, as well. I also just moved from part time to full time working in my field, before I even have the  degree. I was working two jobs before and thankfully was able to quit the dead ender and dedicate my time to something I am passionate about. I love my work and I\\'m learning to love the life I make for myself. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you made it this far, damn. I\\'m proud of you, I would have exited ASAP rocky after seeing the length. And also, kudos to you. Chances are, you\\'re like me, stuck in college and trying to make the best of it. Lemme tell you. It does NOT get easier. But sometimes the shitty parts get a little better. And then you graduate the next semester haha. But all things considered, you GOT this. whether you\\'ve got a disability, you\\'re completely normal and just trying to get through it or you LOVE school and cant wait to get your masters, you got this and you can do whatEVER you put your mind to, that\\'s the MF truth. And for those who might not have a good support system or have family and friends who don\\'t understand college or why you\\'d wanna go... I am proud of you! You\\'re doing amazing and don\\'t let any ignorant people convince you that it\\'s all for nothing. This is a part of your future and you can always say you did it, even if you don\\'t end up in the field you got your degree in. You did that! You\\'re doing that! and it\\'s gonna be awesome. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\npeace and love \\n\\njude\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL:DR : I\\'ve been stuck in higher education for five years and will graduate in december. I felt like ranting about it ;)', \"Struggles affecting my life decisions and mental health TLTR: Asian-American college student’s struggle with life decisions and mental health.\\n\\nHello, I’m here to address some things that are currently and have been affecting me as an Asian-American for a long time. I apologize if this is really long for y’all to read, but I got so much to say from my own dang memory and mindset. \\n\\nI grew up in a Vietnamese-American family where the family values are so important, that every family member knows about each other’s business whether they’re part of it or not. They have high religious and cultural values in which they devote so much of their lives into them. On my dad’s side are a family of Catholics, my mom’s side are Buddhist; so faith is very crucial to the family. Many of the older, adult generations in my family had their own stories of immigration to America. My dad (who passed away last year) was the very first to immigrate to the U.S. back in the mid-eighties. He suffered at a young age in being forced to immigrate, but tended to survive to pursue his dreams. My mom immigrated later after meeting my dad for a while. Besides my dad, I rarely ask my older relatives (aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc.) about these issues such as the Vietnam War and immigration since it’ll obviously traumatize them as well as the language barrier I have with my family, especially my grandparents who couldn’t speak English at all. There were very few school assignments in my life where that involved my grandparents to participate, but of the language barrier. I get frustrated when it comes to the language barrier in my life because I’m the person who understands and speaks the least Vietnamese to my family even though I know the culture, but speak very few phrases and a couple of words. Even my cousins and older twin sister know more than me. I always feel ignorant and guilty when I struggle with that. I grew up and am still in the middle class even if my family could afford going on a few luxurious trips to places like Cancun, Mexico. Because of my dad’s death, (he was the breadwinner) my family and I are quite cautious in our finances since we’re in a lower income status. So that’s the backup and now I’ll tell y’all my main problems\\n\\nDuring my childhood, I was not like most Asian-American children and I’m still not to this day. I was born with a speech delay in which I was unable to speak from my mouth nor have the mindset to know how to socialize. My parents have to speak more English to me instead of their Vietnamese mother tongue in order to not cause confusion in speaking. They still speak their mother tongue and express the Vietnamese culture to me. As I grew up as a kid, my academic progress in school was poor such as getting bad grades, I didn’t fit in much because I was an introvert, I was picked on for being who I am, and scapegoated for making simple mistakes. Due to these problems, I would sometimes react by being angry, cry, stay silent, talk or fight back to gain strength, or fake my feelings by smiling. At home, my parents were the typical strict Asian parents even if they have a little bit of leniency in them. They wanted me to have good grades in school and succeed. My mom chose most of my outfits and required me to wear them. My dad had me do chores around the house. They were very demanding through the most simple tasks like house chores or calling them after arriving home from school. If you didn’t do a task especially calling them, they would get easily concerned, especially my mom since she would have a temper towards me. Throughout my life, my parents compare me to other Viet-American kids they know who meet those standards of high intelligence, discipline, respect, silence, obedience, and adaptation to Vietnamese culture (basically the model minority myth which I don’t associate with at all). \\n\\nAs I grew older after those dark elementary school days, I started to get emotional in high school, crying so many tears when something happened. The smallest mistakes ruin my days and make my mental health so low. Now, I’m in college, the problems have gotten worse. During my years of community college, I wanted to major in photography since I loved the concept of art and business in a way that I could make a decent living, and do what I love. That changed when my dad and mom did not accept my choice and that I had to change to a general major because I didn't know any other majors that would fit me. The general major helped me, but many colleges rushed me to choose a major. I’ve been stressed out in taking classes that will fit my requirements for graduation taking me 3 years to receive my associate’s. Next semester, I am transferring to a university where I’m choosing marketing as my major…for now (I’m still undecided).\\n\\nThroughout my current life including the pandemic life; my mental health has been really low in which I’m having counseling meetings, doctor visits, and journaling because I need so much mental support because of what I go through as an Asian-American. The only problem is that because of cultural value, they cannot relate to what I go through. My mom has been pushing my sister and I more to higher success without doing our own ways such as dropping out since my dad’s passing. During the year 2019, I almost committed self harm in cutting my left wrist. I forgot what I was specifically thinking, but I was really overwhelmed and suicidal during that time. I still am to this day. It’s hard to explain to my mom how I am feeling about my college life due to the language barrier, my rocky relationship with her, and she didn’t attend college herself. Many of the adult women of my family did not attend college and I wanted the bachelor’s to break the legacy. My cousin got hers, why can’t I? At the same time, I don’t know if I could handle the work routine at the University. I’m also unemployed, so I couldn’t find a job that I’m interested in working. I never have time to take a real break from the academic hustle-culture.\\n\\nRecently, I’ve been emotionally bitter, cynical, angry, irritated, and depressed amongst the Vietnamese adults (aunts and uncles) of my family to the point where I could disrespect them which I don’t want to do. I currently don’t like my huge family compared to the past memories I have with them. So I avoid attending too many of their gatherings. I’ve been so negatively impacted with everything in my life unable to gain any positivity. There are still good moments, but they don’t last long for me. I can only relate to the cousins within my generation. They can relate to my sister and I too even though they have backup plans with positive attitudes. I tried to show positivity and not make a scene at family occasions; but they were not working. It’s also worse because of my college crisis and dealing with the loss of my dad. I loved my dad, even if he is still that Asian parent who wants their child to reach a level of success he never had. He was patient, logical, intelligent, and never cried because he loved to have a great time. My Asian mom is hard-working and beautiful; but has a sense of temper and emotion when it comes to these hard times. Recently, she doesn’t really know how to do the important tasks like filling out business forms because my dad would do everything in the household. My sister and I had to help her even though we’re still young because we’re more educated. \\n\\nAll I want from everyone who will see this is to give simple advice and help me get through my life in a different way. I need a way to help me gain the happiness I want without regretting the choices I made.

Even the  \"intro to college/cornerstone\" class everyone is forced to take was 3 credits.\\n\\nMy only two options at the moment are to pay for the classes 800 out of pocket OR to wait until next summer to take all 3 classes together because then it will be more than 6 credits and fafsa will pay for it in full.

I cant take any fall classes either because they have specific interning hours and schools are obviously closed and I cant take that one lonesome class either in the 2nd summer right now because it has a prerequisite.\\n\\nI thought about taking a random course outside my degree like intro to criminology or psychology but it honestly seems like more trouble than it\\'s worth and I will end up having to take 3 classes each both summers if I take an elective.

There were a lot of factors involved with it but it mostly had to do with a lot of things going on in my personal life, not being adequately prepared for my sophomore year while I was a freshman (a lot of material wasn’t covered at all and then I was expected to have it memorized), and my professors expected me to live, breathe, and bleed my profession. Not to mention I have ADHD and autism so it was hard to keep up.

I wrote my suicide note last night. Advice needed. This isn’t a post seeking sympathy. It’s just to express that this past year of school has been overwhelming and I am no longer able to cope and seek help, I guess. I know there are many who feel the same way. Mental health services at my school are subpar. My professors are scattered and wild in their various methods of teaching. I already feel lost and behind and it’s what, the third week of school? I am struggling to see a point to all of this. I think the truth is that I haven’t seen one for a long time. \\n\\nI am in a dorm alone this semester, with a private bathroom and the looming threat (or saving grace) of a potential roommate.

Although I guess that is kind of a stupid thought considering if I am dead I’ll be, for better or for worse, pulled out of school. \\n\\nI’ve vaguely talked to my sparse amount of friends about killing myself and as the gen z attitude goes, they thought I was joking. It’s not that I’m expecting a bunch of other college students to know what to do or say, but I’m just tired of reaching out at this point. Writing the note was blissful in the respect that I could finally say what I couldn’t in person. I don’t blame them for thinking it’s a joke. I tried hard to hide everything I was feeling last semester, but I don’t think I can anymore. \\n\\nTherapy through the school last semester did nothing but bring up unresolved trauma and encourage disordered eating.

I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels. I am dreading telling her that I have even more work to do. I have to go back and study the class notes from all of my classes that I have taken during graduate school, Which is about 8 classes. Since I have been out of school for so long I need to refresh my memory.. I'm worried that my mom might kick me out when she finds out that it is going to take me longer to graduate. I don't blame her. I've been in school for eight years! She is getting tired of me. I should have studied harder. And my credit card debt is stressing me out. And my sister is getting mad at me because of all the reasons my mother is. She's tired of me living off of my mom and not talking responsibility for my life. She’s ever suggesting that I cut my hours at work to pay down my credit card debt, which is not something I can afford to do since I have so many bills. I just wanted to talk about why I am depressed. I’m tired of being alive. It feels like there is nothing to look forward too.\", \"Going to college has been the worst mistake of my life This is a ventpost, so if you don't want to hear my whining feel free to not read.\\n\\nSo I'm a pretty standard case of honor-student-turned-fuckup. Graduated high school with high honors, basically every teacher and adult in my life practically begging me to go. I go into college for history (my then-and-still favorite subject), despite not having a single clue what I wanted to do with the degree (I don't care for teaching, museum work is pretty much all boring hometown history that doesn't interest me in the slightest).\\n\\nI end up going to a pathetic school that is cutting two programs every year, yet still has millions to throw at sports and vanity projects. This isn't to try to shift blame, all of my (many, *many*) academic failings in college are 100% my fault. I constantly procrastinated, barely studied for most courses. I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you why I was so suicidal bad at most of them if you asked me. Those problems became a million times worse from 2020-2021 when courses were online-only, which I found almost completely incompatible with my brain. Should go without saying, but transferring is not an option with my GPA.\\n\\nAfter the online courses ended, I realized I started to hate even being on the campus, every time I went there, it feels like a panic attack was just hanging over me, ready to hit me at a moment's notice. The brutalist (read: cheap) concrete buildings straight out of the Khruschev administration don't help lol.\\n\\nI looked forward to actually learning things, and being able to explore my interests in an academic setting. Unfortunately, besides a couple of amazing professors, I learned almost nothing I couldn't have already learned on my own from free online courses or just simply reading.\\n\\nThe American higher education system is nothing more than a mafia that has no interest in anything about you besides your bank account. Nothing in my life has made me feel more like just another number than college, even my low-end jobs has made me feel more valued.\\n\\nI'm 22 now. I'm still enrolled, and this morning I was sent a letter demanding another $2000 in payments. I'm almost certain at this point I'm just going to tank the debt and drop out. Just thinking about it makes me nauseous instantly, and my brain starts going to suicide after thinking about it a bit longer. I've already taken multiple semesters off, including this one. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life before college, I didn't know what I wanted to do when I was in college, and I don't know what I want to do now. Basically, College has made no difference in my life aside from the fuckload of debt, mental illness, stress, and wasted time. Whatever.\\n\\nI know there's a million posts on this sub that read exactly like mine, but I figure I might as well add on to the pile. Give me some advice, kind words, or call me a pussy idiot.\\n\\nE: I'm actually pretty surprised how many replies and upvotes this got. I wanna thank everyone for the kind and harsher words and advice alike. I think the overwhelming theme I get from the replies is that I have a lot of options to explore, and that I'm not locked into whatever cast I chose when I was 17. I'm most likely going to take a couple semesters off at the minimum, and try to gather some more experience while I try to explore a few more options in terms of what I might want to do for a career. Stuff like exploring trades, job fairs, going harder into the service industry, etc.\", 'Starting college with tons of untreated mental illnesses Anxiety, depression, adhd and body dysmorphia (also suicidal).

This decision was made because I am genuinely sick and tired of my college and the god awful experiences I’ve had at this miserable “higher education” institution. Basically, of my possible majors, illustration would take the shortest additional time to complete. I just started year four and after this year I’ll still have two more full years with 9 credits or 3 courses each semester. This really sucks. \\n\\nAnyways, I’ve taken a large number of art classes, all of them redundant and repetitive classes that are for some reason all required. So far I’ve taken Drawing I, Painting I, Two Dimensional Design, Three Dimensional Design, Typography I, and Digital Design. Right now I’m taking Drawing II and Illustration I. \\n\\nDrawing II has been the main reason I’m losing faith that I can enjoy being creative or artistic anymore. In this class we work on one big drawing project the whole semester. Which would normally sound great but it is turning out horribly. \\n\\nFor starters, I really I liked my idea for the piece and I liked how it looked at first. Dare I say it, I thought I would enjoy this. But, because art can’t ever be fun or creative in college, my professor criticized me for my ideas and told me to change a bunch of things. At first I went with it because in art school critiques essentially hold your grade at gunpoint. I obliged and followed her ideas. \\n\\nThen, today, for another critique on our work in progress, she claimed I did a bunch of things wrong and that I should just start over. All while coming off very condescending and rude in a sort of a “I know best” way. Also, this assignment’s criteria seem to be either a setup for student failure or she’s just really stupid or ignorant. \\n\\nI want to die inside. I loved what I had come up with but then she wants it all changed to fit her mold all so I can get a good grade. I’m tired of this shit. I’m genuinely burnt out. I haven’t enjoyed drawing as much as I used to in some time. I really worry after this I won’t want to draw anymore. Does anyone have any tips on how to keep enjoying creating artwork on your own while in college for art? I try to do my own stuff and just immediately think it’s not good enough and give up. Sorry for the length, I’m just not in a great place and need to vent. \\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nI’m burnt out on art classes because they are repetitive, uncreative, and the professors are condescending and rude all the time with impossible expectations or horrible unhelpful critiques.', 'I’m practically done at this point Update: I’m going to Texas to be with my aunt and uncle for a while!

I don't want to say academics are boring but it has been getting more boring than usual. I never really thought I'd get this far tbh. I only held on because I had a bit of talent in academics. I was able to ace my way through highschool but college is something else. I guess I just hit my limit and stretched it far too much at this point. For rn i still have a 3.1 gpa but I've been steadily just failing my classes. Like I'm studying but not really. I'm doing the problems just not really studying, don't know if that makes sense. There are times where I get this jolt of excitement when I start learning something new. It used to be so consistent but now its just bleh. I don't know if my social life or my mental health has a factor to do with it. Ima just be honest, feel free to call me out on my bs. I never really had any friends in highschool or currently in college. I have lab partners or classmates I sometimes or rarely interact with. I still act like this well educate and smart person around my family. Maybe all the fake studying is a facade just to not worry my parents. Every time i tell one of my family members my major, which is Biomedical Engineering they always put me on a pedestal and I hate myself for it cs I'm not doing anything really. I know I'm like the first one in my family to go to college much less if its something like engineering. College is affordable and paying out of pocket because of the scholarships and being commute at the same time. I'm afraid my grades are going to get so bad that my scholarships will be taken away. I started overeating, I don't exercise, my room is messy, it's been an absolute mess but i've been good at hiding everything from my parents. I want to to revive my passion for math and science but I've just been utterly failing. I've also been having suicide thoughts but as a logical thinker I know thats a dumb solution for my problem for atleast rn. If one thing good that comes out of this is how stubborn i've been.

Hope your guys have a nice day.\", 'I hate college Sorry to be negative but-\\nI’ve been chronically depressed and suicidal since middle school. I thought going to college would be a good thing, but it’s not. I’m a 19 year old girl in my second year now and I hate it. I thought I was supposed to have the best times of my life but in reality I’m stuck on zoom where no one even interacts with each other. I thought I was supposed to meet the love of my life, have my first relationship, or experience a love life for once. But nah, that’s not gonna happen. I barely have friends, and my best friend is just as depressed as me. Yes I get help, yes I take meds, trust me I’ve tried it all. I don’t have a supportive family and the state of the world is fucking fucked. I put myself in debt for what.

Thank you to the people who encouraged me to keep going. Y’all are the best and I really appreciated all of your kind words back when I was really struggling. \\n\\nI dropped out of college in the middle of my last semester of my last year. I go to a school 4 hours away from my family. Last fall, my grandparents died in a car accident and I was basically forced to mourn them in isolation (because of distance, online classes, busy friends, etc.) Last semester was awful but I managed to make it through with B’s and C’s. I started heavily drinking though. This current semester my suicidal thoughts and self-harm habits hit me like a ton of bricks. I hated my apartment, my friends, my school, and most of all myself. I was drinking 2 bottles of wine a day and struggling to even get out of bed and go to class. I dropped out and checked myself into a psych ward for 6 days. Now that I’ve been out for a few weeks it’s starting to hit me that I dropped out when I only needed 3 more classes to graduate. I feel like a failure, but I know that if I had kept going the way that I was, it would’ve literally killed me. I have no motivation to go back either, I was a straight A student up until this point- in the honors college with a merit scholarship and everything. I hate that I dropped out because I feel like I’ve disappointed the old me who loved learning.

I have two simple degrees and I’m aiming (scratch that, NEED) to get a bachelors to continue my life plan.\\n\\nOnly problem is... i can’t take it anymore. \\n\\nI know just about everything when it comes to my college—it’s because I was apart of student government, student activities, student marketing, and some legacy work.

Nope.\\nCalled to work a day after a trip to the hospital.\\nI had to stop my car several times on the way there to puke out the door.\\n\\nMind you, my job at the time was not that time sensitive, I just had a boss that had no boundaries (The kind of boss that guilt trips you to work more hours but not get paid for them).\\n\\nFunny enough, I had to work on marketing a new suicide awareness event for my college the day after I found out my friend committed suicide.\\nI was told I should be happy to work on the project, and that crushed me.

Can I suck it up and dive back in?\\n\\nI’m not sure. After (forcibly) quitting my job today, I lost the remaining motivation I had.

I mostly went to this college because it was the “best” college I got into (the others were lower-tier state schools while my college is an okay-ish private school). Even though it’s only been one year, I haven’t had that many good moments. I haven’t made any real friends that I consider myself close to. I've been invited to trips and outings with some friends but only when another person dropped out. So I guess I'm kind of their backup friend. Right before I left for Winter Break, I called the suicide hotline and cried to them that I didn’t connect with anyone at my school despite trying. I also went to therapy regularly at my school and towards the end of the first semester, I went a LOT more. I’ve cried more times than I can count within the last year. I was also sent to a psych ward in March and attempted suicide twice as well as self-harmed numerous times.

However, I got a 2.3 GPA this past semester (two As, one of which wasn't counted toward my GPA, one A-, a B-, and an F). This would give me an overall GPA of 2.8. I was the President of the freshman class and I was elected to be the Sophomore Class President. I’m involved in blog writing as well as an acapella group, so I definitely tried to get involved in my school. I also just became the Vice President of an Asian American student organization at my college. \\n\\nWhen my mom suggested that I buy plane tickets to fly back to my college in August, I literally filled up with anxiety.

I’m jealous of my high school peers when I think about what they might be doing. \\n\\nIf it matters, I’m from California and moved to Georgia for college, and have never previously been on the East Coast. I think I’ve adapted well though I don’t know if I’m just depressed or if I’d really be better off somewhere else.

In high school I did really well, but in college did a complete 180. I was at Syracuse for a year, and failed my first semester entirely. I didn’t do much better during the second, and got a B, C, and two Ds and ended up withdrawing from one of my classes.

I also really hated math. so I chose art.\\n\\nI initially got accepted to an art school for one of the top rated programs globally in the honors program. I was ecstatic. but I graduated high school in 2020, and even after moving to my campus I almost immediately dropped out and went back home. the sudden switch to online was too insufferable to deal with, the classes were in disarray, my roommates (who I was childhood friends with) sucked me dry financially and then cut me off, etc. pretty much as soon as I dropped out my love and drive for art and education died, because I was at rock bottom mentally and so disappointed in myself. I have struggled with depression my whole life and that mental state I was in was terrifying, and the only thing that kept me from not ending it all was my cat, because then he would be alone again. I thank him every day for being my reason to stay because i am at the happiest in my life and have a wonderful romantic relationship. anyways back to the sad stuff.\\n\\nthen I began at the university in my home town as a psychology/undecided major. I just picked psychology but then only did gen eds because there wasn't an undecided category. assumed I would make up my mind in my 2nd year. but holy fuck, that school SUCKED. not the professors. the actual administrators and counselors. never helped me sign up for classes, would randomly drop and assign me classes THE DAY BEFORE THE SEMESTER , not register my Pell grants so I couldn't buy my school supplies, etc. I did 2 years there but one semester was all for naut because I had another Mental Episode and didn't do any work the last month and didn't know about getting that pardoned.\\n\\nnow I'm in an online university about halfway done with my degree. its more fast pace with 8 week classes. I am finally feeling that joy I had for education in high school. but it feels really slow so I've been teaching myself stuff on the side.

I still am fearful of my future struggles in the tech industry and hope I can remedy it by securing a remote job. working remotely is a big thing for me because I have health issues along with being autistic and struggling to hold a job because of my poor attendance due to always being sick. \\n\\nI am lucky to have a supportive parent. I am lucky to be able to focus 100% on my studies and not have to work a real job. I am lucky to have stinking cute cats and a happy relationship. but it took so long to get here im worried about the financial ruin I will be facing after graduation. I want to continue to live in this aesthetic student bliss where I'm happy and succeeding and not face the consequences of jumping schools so much. I have a really good and easy life now for this past year, but it's been really hard for most of my life im waiting for the other shoe to drop.\\n\\n\\ntl;dr\\nit's fucking hard out here for a drop out art school student pursuing tech at my 3rd university.\", 'Bad idea to transfer? I’m at my college and despite prestige it sucks here. \\n\\nI love the academics, faculty, and lgbt acceptance in here and the school is the best of the nation. \\n\\nI’m tired of this shit though. For more than two years I’ve never been able to find a solid friend group due to autism and honestly i feel like I have a gun at the back of my head the more I stay here. I risk violence from church friends if I speak up about the abuse I endured while growing up in their church (they have a local branch on campus) and I’m tired of the stigma of staying here. I was locked out of opportunities because my sister attended the same school last year and she would out me to my parents. She’s gone now to a new college but I’m tired of my social situation and literally every single day I stay here more it feels like I am more at risk for violence. I also never really got any sort of independence and influence from my family as they are in state close by and have some sort of ties to the school. But my biggest dilemma is that my parents will discipline me harshly and I will face immense pressure from the church for speaking up about the psychological abuse I endured. \\n\\nMy new college is less accepting and the administration is less competent. The friend group I’m in I’ve known them for two fucking years and I have problems with their political beliefs being questionable but otherwise they’re the most fucking tight knit group I’ve ever known since I applied to colleges in 2021. Honestly they’re the only thing making me sane and I already attempted suicide because of my conditions at my current college and I would’ve been dead without them. \\n\\nI want that future. But I don’t know if I deserve it considering I also have a scholarship to my current uni which is a dream for most people but a slap in the face to me as in return I may lose my fucking livelihood with dangerous people on campus (being my former church friends). Idk but I will lose the little emotional support my family provides and if things get bad enough I might be disowned by my family entirely and risk homelessness (not a big chance but being raised in a cult it can happen when people trust the institution over their own children and go as far as to shun them). \\n\\nI’m behind on credits. I have 3 years left. Should I stick it out or transfer?', 'What are your experiences going to a campus counselor/therapist or using any other campus mental health resource?

It costed me my mental health though. I have diagnksed depression and alot of it is situational including my anxiety. Every week I had panic attacks, mental breakdowns, and suicidal thoughts. I wanted to take a semester off and decided to do so until my parents convinced me otherwise. Also the fact that I would hate myself if I fell behind in college. Even though I just began therapy again and JUST started my medication again. The meds won't change my negative mindset. I truly hate myself and college doesn't help me but it just makes my self esteem worse especially since I am in art school and constantly comparing my work. Not only that but there is always someone better than you and it makes me feel inferior to others. I just had a month off for winter break but I am still exhausted and barely did anything. I just don't know if I should take a semester off. None of my friends are except one who hasn't started college yet and one other person is only taking one class. I feel like a failure all the time. Should I take time off even thought my next classes are very crucial to my degree or should I try and take time to myself?\", 'College has become unbearable. I\\'m a chemistry major, so my life was mostly studying *before* COVID, but now it\\'s all I ever do. I have two lab classes per week, a weekly oral report in one class, and a 20-page lab report due every week in another. I average about three quizzes per week, and just finished my fifth midterm this week. \\n\\nI literally don\\'t do anything but work anymore. I\\'m severely depressed and my friends don\\'t talk anymore because, well, nobody actually sees each other. We have to do a mandatory two-week quarantine in a hotel room if we even come into the same room as a positive case, and I don\\'t think I\\'ll be able to handle the stress of full quarantine plus my course load. Expulsion after the second COVID-related offense. A truly disturbing number of people I know have either attempted suicide or developed serious drug issues in the past couple of months. Social isolation had made me paranoid around other people and my social anxiety has become ten times worse than it has ever been. I feel like this is absolutely ruining me. \\n\\nI want to help stop the spread, but at what cost to my mental and physical wellbeing? I feel like such a piece of shit because my college\\'s administration *constantly* sends out emails shaming students, telling us we should be ashamed if we don\\'t agree with the restrictions put in place (because it\\'s \"our duty\" to help). One of my weekly COVID tests came back \"invalid\" (meaning an error occured in the analysis), and our health center lectured ME when I called to reschedule, as if it was somehow my fault. I completely agree that we need to do our part to stop COVID, but I\\'m tired of the shame and threats, because I feel like the restrictions are slowly killing me. Making students feel ashamed for wanting normalcy is the worst possible thing for anyone with a mental illness. \\n\\nWhat\\'s the point anymore? My college doesn\\'t allow gap years, so I have no choice but to suffer through literal *constant* work and studying, all in solitude, with nothing to break the monotony. I completely understand why the restrictions are important, but it\\'s hard not to feel like it\\'s a little inhumane to keep someone confined to a tiny room for months with nothing but homework to do. Idk. Just needed to get that off my chest. :(', 'Two Weeks In and I\\'m Already Dying I started classes last week and I\\'m already feeling like I want to yeet myself out of the window! Most of my professors are wonderful and my current schedule could be better but I did what I could for what\\'s available but! I hate the fact that \"sorry professor, if I leave my apartment today, I\\'m not sure I won\\'t just throw myself into the river\" isn\\'t a good reason to not come to class.

I have bipolar disorder type 2 (diagnosed).\\n\\nI still can\\'t focus but because I\\'m non traditionally aged, psychologists refuse to take me to test me for any learning disabilities (because my educational needs were just brushed aside as \"laziness\")! And it\\'s not like I\\'m intentionally trying to miss classes, it\\'s just I\\'m positive they\\'d be cleaning my body up from the cement.\\n\\nI dropped a required class because the professor said that we have to plan all family emergencies in advance and even then, that will count against us and she will drop us a letter grade! She also refused to use my preferred name and pronouns. Even if we get COVID, she expects us to show up!\\n\\nI just wish I could convey to my professors that I\\'m not dumb and that I\\'m trying. I\\'m terrified of reaching out to my professors because I\\'m scared of what their responses might be because academia doesn\\'t seem very empathetic to mental illnesses or treating them as disabilities. Sure, they can put orange ribbons out during suicide awareness month and pretend they care by advertising their counseling services (expensive) but in the end, I wish there were better accommodations.', 'An accounting college third-year, don\\'t know or remember anything and it\\'s my fault.  \\n\\nI   started my accounting degree at 2019 at distance form because we  didn\\'t  have enough money. I pretty much fell into believing the myth  that it\\'s  easy cuz it has math. Back in high school, I failed to learn  proper  study habits and effectively whatever I studied was forgotten  roughly a  week after the test. During my first college exam, I was  terrified- I  had a month to study two subjects and barely could  remember anything.  And then, the professor said \"You can use your  books.\\'\\' And with liberal  book use i ended up acing the exam. Most  exams after that were open  book, and i aced and aced. But my problem  remained - whenever I tried to  study, I could barely focus. I didn\\'t  tell my parents, because i didn\\'t  want to worry them. Then COVID hit,  and I was introduced to the  \\'\\'wonderful\\'\\' online school, which  additionally impacted me. The final  hit was, when after my second year  my father got sick with throat  cancer. I saw the strong, wise man that  had raised me be reduced to a  bed-ridden, diaper using shell of a  person. My focusing ability crashed  to zero. Barely anything  registered, I was apathetic to everything(I  still am), I had no energy,  I stopped caring about accounting. But I  kept acing and acing.

Sorry if my rant sounds disjointed, English isn\\'t my native language.', \"I'm breaking down I'm a college freshman on scholarship currently residing in Hungary. My first semester is almost finished and it is currently the exam period. I started college believing it would be a wonderful experience as everyone says but so far its been more or less one of the worst periods of my life. During my midterms, I did quite well. I wouldn't say that I'm really good at studies but I have managed to go through high school maintaining good grades. But it's not the same now. So far my exams have kind of sucked. Although I have managed to score good marks in my other subjects but I don't know why I feel like I can't this time. I have been having a lot (a lot) of difficulty studying. Every time I think about sitting down to study, I can't bring myself to it thinking it won't be any use since I won't be able to score good anyway and probably end up failing the subject. I've barely made any friends, although I'm not the type that does. I come from a background where mental health is treated as something that is non-existent. I have talked to some of the people, my friends, girlfriend thinking that it would help but surprisingly it hasn't. Everyone keeps saying that I have to be strong and that if I can't do something, I have to force myself to do it. Another problem is that my roommates are all scoring really good and it feels like they are not at all stressed about anything. It is not even like they study all the time. They literally sit down two days before the exam and end up acing it. I admit that I have had mental problems in the past but given the non serious attitude of my family towards mental issues, its hard for me to recognize what exactly it is that I suffer from. I have had almost five panic attacks in the last seven days. Most of the time, I feel like being on my own. I've been crying a lot alone in the bathroom since I can't really do it in my room cause of the roommates. Also I have been feeling really homesick. Sometimes I am able to somehow make my peace with the fact that it is okay if I don't do well but things even as little as seeing people talk about exams as if they know everything and seeing my roommates doing acting like brilliant know-it-alls makes me feel immensely depressed and borderline suicidal. Although I feel like maybe what I need is some friends that are going through the same thing but no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to just go up and talk to someone random even if it's just saying hi.\", 'college ruined me. 23F. Graduated ~1 year ago. \\n\\nI just feel so hopeless and broken. I destroyed my body and mind to get through school and it’s done nothing for me but traumatize me. \\n\\nI had issues with depression and anxiety before school but it just made everything so much worse. I went to a largish school that was really focused on Greek life for the degree programs (a terrible decision by 18yo me, from a very small town). I remained an outsider there and never really made friends, failed to click with any clubs or groups. \\n\\nMy whole life my family’s dream for me was to go to college, so I felt like I couldn’t fail them or go to them when I was struggling. I also have commitment issues so I didn’t feel like I could switch schools. \\n\\nI became extremely, extremely isolated. I would go weeks without talking to anyone except for an older lady who would check me into the cafeteria. I didn’t have a car the first two years so I couldn’t really go home, I was just stuck up there except for thanksgiving and winter breaks. I was too mentally to work so I didn’t have any extra money. Also, I didn’t understand how my meal plan worked so I was just eating 1 meal a day for a long time. \\n\\nI became extremely depressed, anxiety skyrocketed to the point of daily panic attacks, touch starved, and suicidal. I just wanted the pain to stop. I buried myself in school work, escaped through social media, and basically shut off all emotion and went into survival mode so I could push through. Never made a true friend, never had a relationship, never went to a party. \\n\\nThings got better once I had a car for the last 2 1/2 years and I could visit home. For two semesters during COVID lockdown I actually got to work on school from home, which helped a lot, but then my last semester we were back in person. There it all came back and it got worse again. \\n\\nI feel like I was a ghost, no one ever noticed me or knew I existed. After graduation I basically had a nervous breakdown and I moved back in with my family. I would constantly have panic attacks even after leaving and every night in my nightmares I would be back there working on endless projects and stressing about tests I didn’t study for, or back in the dorm bunk beds wishing I wouldn’t wake up. Certain smells or things would also take me back. Even driving through the city the college is in I break out in a cold sweat. I feel like I’m still mentally stuck there and still mentally 18 years old. \\n\\nLuckily my family intervened and got me medication and therapy, but other than stopping the panic attacks the meds didn’t do much for my mental health and my social anxiety was too much for talk therapy.\\n\\nAfter all that I sacrificed and all I destroyed in my health I’m still in my hometown barely holding onto a job that only requires a high school diploma. I can’t move out due to financial reasons and I can’t go to another city because my whole support  system is here. \\n\\nAlso, I’m still deeply lonely. I feel like I have a void or a brokenness inside me that will never be better. I feel numb and like I’m not an active part in my own life. I’m still hurting. I’ve been really impulsive lately and I’ve been spending more money on stupid things I don’t need. I’m wanting more and more to just numb out with alcohol and weed (I haven’t actually gone that far yet but it’s harder to resist). I really want a relationship and to have my own family but all of this is in the way and I can barely care for myself. \\n\\nI feel like there was no reason for me to go through what I did, and the school can just keep on churning students through like nothing happened. What was all of this for? How do I stop feeling this way?', \"College at home sucks when I have to listen to fighting and yelling every single day. I'm so fucking done with my family. I'm so fucking done.\\n\\nMy dad is verbally abusive and inconsiderate and doesn't care if he's yelling or distracting me, yet still wants me to get good grades. He has a sick and twisted view of what a family should be like, stuff like how I owe him for all he's given to me (like raised me), and throws a tantrum over every little thing. He calls my mom and I ungrateful, lazy, selfish, spoiled, and thinks he's the most selfless and generous person in the world. I've dealt with this for my whole life but every year of college gets tougher. He's a hypocritical, inconsiderate, self-righteous piece of shit and I'm just waiting for the day he'll be permanently gone from my life.\\n\\n\\nMy mom has to deal with this shit every day. If she ever makes a mistake or doesn't read his mind of what he wants, he'll get mad, and then another tantrum well ensue. She's at her tipping point right now and she's just complaining about him to me everyday, which I don't mind but I have stuff I need to do. I've never learned to be emotional responsive and available, given my family situation for the last 19 years of my life, so I don't know what the fuck to do. They can't divorce, they're financial codependent, so until something regarding that is taken care of I'm stuck with this.\\n\\n\\nI've tried to calmly talk to my dad about this, of course he basically disregards everything I'm saying (asking him to be more calm, quiet, and understanding) and said how I'm unappreciative and selfish and lazy again. Then he started yelling and I left back to my room where he was mad for the rest of the day and let me know of it.\\n\\n\\nI'm taking 18 credits, I'm part of a research program, two clubs, and I have to put up with all of this every single day for the next semester, if not the rest of the year. I just wanted to go to college, the physical place, escape my household environment, and have fun with friends, but instead I'm stuck here, studying amid this mess.\\n\\n\\nI just want to finish college, get out of this house, get a job, a find a therapist.\\n\\n\\n(In case it comes across this way, I'm not suicidal and I won't think of self harm.)\", \"I live here now ig Want to withdraw for the semester, can't because I had to beg for my finaid back because last year was multiple whammies at once from uncles suicide to health deteriorating to a mental breakdown during finals in spring.\\n\\nNow it s: nobody is masking up at our football games, some students have reported to have covid and likely more that the schools not revealing. Because most professors won't change their attendance policies for COVID, some have probably shown up sick.

I know everyone struggles but I feel like I'm relapsing but I feel too frozen to leave my bed. When I'm in class, I'll do my best to pay attention but what we'd learned feels so hazy, even with detailed notes. In German, we were going over interests and it feels like my brain skipped something and I couldn't figure out what was going on and couldn't understand a thing. And my notes were there but I may as well have never heard of German for how much I struggled to even comprehend what was going on. I pass all the assignments but fail all the quizzes. Don't know how that works.\\n\\nI'm working wiith disability services but it's hard to acommodate learning disabilities when we dont know what they are and the fact that nobody diagnosis adults on medicaid at my age.

I'm in therapy, I'm on meds, I have a new psychiatrist whom I don't see until late November.\\n\\nBasically. I wanna withdraw because mental illness is getting worse but I can't because financial aid stuff (I receive the pell grant and article two stipulates I have to pay it back and I am poor as shit).\", 'Getting Harrassed for Sitting? I go to a Liberal Arts University in Washington State that is a pain in the ***. Most of the students there have rich parents and don’t care about anyone below them. I hate it there and I am only go for the free scholarship.\\n\\nAnyways, it starts with me being a clinically depressed commuter student who lives with her husband about 1 1/2 hours away from the University. \\n\\nRecently, my depression has been through the damn roof! I cried for about 2 hours straight the other day… I had a chemistry lab due that I could not make up for. If I didn’t go, I would have to say goodbye to my scholarship. Due to my depression however, I did not feel safe going alone! I even teared up with the thought of going alone. I had been suicidal in the past and I was afraid I was gonna jump in front of a car or something dangerous (Ferry and Bus Commuter). My husband, who is the light of my life, decided he would go with me and wait.\\n\\nSo, we take the ferries and buses to the city where my University is in (about 2 hours that day) and we have a good time for the half of the day. I won’t go into detail because it isn’t important to the story. \\n\\nWe head to the bus stop that take us to the university and we get soaked from a sudden downpour of rain! My husband is freezing and his hands are turning white. I offer him to go back home, but he wants to still come with me to make sure I’ll be safe. We get there and realize there are no benches under cover. Luckily, it stopped raining by then, however, it was still cold. We finally find a bench he can sit on and I give him my hoodie for them to cover his legs with. I feel terrible to leave him like that but he insisted he would be ok and just try to hurry with my lab. \\n\\nI go to lab and my professor is 15 minutes! The lab takes a lot longer than expected because the details of the lab are confusing! I finish about 1:30 hours later.\\n\\nI ran outside to my husband I see him white and shivering. He was sitting on a different bench than before. I apologize for minutes and minutes without stopping, and I am on the urge of crying.\\n\\nAfter he calms me down, he explains he was on a different bench because people were harassing him. First, security harassed him for just sitting there on his phone. He wasn’t doing anything suspicious, just watching a show on his phone. Then, a few students were talking freely on “there is a weirdo sitting over on that bench”. Finally, an older lady takes a picture of him. After all that harassment, just decided to move to another spot that isn’t as noticeable.\\n\\nFor a man to accompany for wife while she was not in her right of mind is punished.

In year 1 my main mentor was fired for a horrible scandal that affected the whole program and I resented myself for looking up to him and being oblivious.\\n\\nIn year 2 I ended up in the psych ward for being suicidal and took a medical leave and started therapy and medications. I came back the next semester but now struggled with how I process information and everyday would fall asleep in the library because it just overwhelms me trying to study or read or learn things. I gained a lot of weight so quickly from the meds and I got so tired all the time.\\n\\nIn year 3 I developed a horrible insomnia problem one of the worst cases my psychiatrist at the time said she\\'d seen. I had so much night anxiety I avoided going to bed because every time I laid there for hours unable to sleep, my head was filled with horrible thoughts about a broken friendship that would take years of therapy to get over. I got registered with my school\\'s disability accommodations, which helped some. But every semester I still have been feeling like I\\'m in constant unhealthy misery and I kept failing all my non-performance classes like academic type classes that require more writing and reading and intellectual engagement and the only time I do pass those types of classes is because I\\'m retaking them after failing them the first time.\\n\\nIn year 4 I took less units to make it manageable but I developed an annoying vomiting problem associated with anxiety. Had to vomit into a trashcan before every music performance because I constantly felt it almost come out and would only feel better after getting it out of my system.

I tried so hard and to teach myself so many things, I couldn\\'t even enjoy what was basically a 2 year vacation from college because of how much shit I struggled with everyday. I took a hiatus from being a musician. Eventually I took a big scary step in getting myself back into it, and had some really memorable experiences with people and kids again that inspired me to go back to college and finish my music degree.\\n\\nI came back to school this semester and took even less units (10). I had prepared so much, by re-auditioning into the music program, using a lot of self help and study habits and organization habits and sleep habits I spent all that time learning, using accommodations from the disability office, I even had this cool expensive portable fan I always had because I get so anxious when I get sweaty. I did well in the first few weeks but now it\\'s week 12 and the past 7 weeks I have constantly felt like I was one bad day away from going back to the psych ward. I have missed so many classes again, so much homework, this one class I\\'m doing for the second time (because I failed it) we have to listen to orchestral music to I can\\'t even listen to it because it induces my PTSD.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried a bunch of different creative ADHD methods of learning and working in unconventional ways like drawing shapes because it helps me listen to orchestral music or finding a giant whiteboard room in the library and going through my learning processes with expo markers instead of a paper and pencil or laptop. I have missed 6 weeks of my music history class because it\\'s at 8am and my insomnia has fucking triple worsened. I\\'ve started sleeping more and more like 11 hours a day because of all this stress and I tried sleeping in my car in the college parking lot just so I can make it to the class, I tried going to bed at 6pm but that didn\\'t work either. My history professor cut me a lot of slack when I explained all this in her office hours offering me an alternative way I can still somehow pass the course by watching a lot of related history videos or audio medias and just summarize everything so I technically am fulfilling the course learning outcomes. But no matter how hard I tried I just can\\'t do anything anymore. I\\'m not fucking around going to clubs or parties or wasting time doing things that made me wish I had used that time on school. I\\'ve done everything I possibly could and don\\'t feel I\\'ve made any wrong decisions. I\\'ve done everything my therapist advised me to do like taking just a bit of personal time for myself everyday, trying to make new friends again, etc.\\n\\nMy other professor, who I really look up to, called me into his office about something I already knew I was in trouble for. We started off by just asking me how I\\'ve been doing recently and before I knew it I just started breaking down so badly just ugly crying about how horrible everything has been, how much I have struggled with every single class, and that I\\'m aware I\\'ve been \"acting out\" and acting inappropriately erratic sometimes in some classes like saying weird shit in front of others that\\'s made them uncomfortable because \"being a goof\" has been one of the ways I cope with my fucking severe ADHD. And nobody wants to be my fucking friend because this is all they see. My psychiatrist has not given me anything for my ADHD because they \"liked how well I was internally treating my own symptoms at the beginning of the semester with my dedicated habits and structure\" but I have to wait like 2 months between each appointment because of waiting lists and I have been trying so much to get my hands on some fucking Adderall or something to calm me down. I kept crying about how much I hate college that this place has been nothing but \"misery failure and loneliness for the past 7 years\" and if I wanted to take even less units to make it easier on myself I\\'d need to pay tuition out of pocket instead of financial aid now I have to pay money to be fucking miserable here and it\\'ll take another 3 or 4 years at minimum and I just wanted my grandma to see me graduate college before she dies because she\\'s been the only good parent to me all my life.\\n\\nThey were very supportive and just listening to me rant about all my fucking traumas and why it relates to how much I\\'m struggling: my family abused me so much I regularly had murderous intrusive thoughts as a teenager, I sacrifice so much to make myself needed by others even if they treat me like shit because being \"used\" by people feels like love and I am incapable of having my own self-worth, I\\'ve had to learn how to be good at lying and hiding how I feel inside by being a goof and how much I\\'ve learned to read other people\\'s body language and facial expressions and slight changes in energies, goddamn it I can\\'t type up anymore of this shit I can\\'t relieve all this anymore. They said I was a really amazing person and they asked me \"Do you think you\\'d be happy as a music teacher?\" And I just shrugged my shoulders and kept crying because I didn\\'t even know the answer. and that they weren\\'t even aware of how much I constantly go through and I said it\\'s because I\\'ve opened up to people and mentors and got hurt so many times I\\'m too scared to go through it one more time, and they said they want to check up on me again very soon because they were seriously worried about my well-being. He gave me some good life advice before I left and I have never broken down like that ever in my entire life in front of any adult or therapist and I realistically think from my own history that it will get worse from here.\\n\\nJust today, I was overwhelmed by all these murderous intrusive thoughts coming back, I kept punching my fist against the dash while I was driving home in my car, screaming my lungs out, experiencing flashbacks about all the horrible parts of my life while trying to focus on driving, and being so worried what would happen if I stepped foot again on college campus in front of all these classmates I feel like don\\'t give a shit about me, have never even cared to understand why I\\'m like this, and that I\\'m going to snap in front of everyone and start doing really horrible things when I have a psychotic breakdown because I can\\'t hide how horrible I feel anymore.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do anymore, I don\\'t really feel like I have anyone left except one really good friend on reddit. All of my previous symptoms and health struggles are still present and affecting me simultaneously even with medication and therapy support. My therapist recommended a local crisis house I can go to where I can leave anytime instead of the psych ward. I\\'ve given everything I could\\'ve to try to finish my music degree, even if I didn\\'t end up becoming a music teacher in life I wanted to at least finish my degree for my own self satisfaction but I can\\'t take this anymore. I can\\'t take one more semester. I don\\'t even think I can finish the semester. I don\\'t even think I can handle one more day. I just wanted to make the world a better place and help children but I can\\'t even make my own life a better place and I can\\'t even soothe my inner child that has been crying out for help since day 1.\\n\\nTLDR: got depression and anxiety and PTSD and insomnia and ADHD and a shit ton of other mental health problems I\\'ve spent years working through but no matter how much I try and start over again with therapy and disability accommodations and creative study habits and meditation and CBD and exercise and diet and every fucking solution imaginable I can\\'t do this anymore. I don\\'t realistically think I\\'ll get through college to finish my music degree without committing suicide before I get my degree or any degree or even taking more years only taking a couple classes at a time or transferring to any other school. I\\'ve had more and more psychotic breakdowns everyday and I\\'m scared I will do something horrible if I step onto college campus one more time.', 'My Main Life Problem \\nTL:DR: College student struggling on what to do with life, but does not want to upset family. \\n\\nTo start off, I want to say that I apologize for this really long post.\\n\\nI had a rough childhood when I was young. I never knew what I truly wanted to be when I grew up until 7th grade when I got involved in the school musical. Ever since then, I’ve always wanted to be in the entertainment industry. I had an entire plan of going to college in New York or Philadelphia to pursue majors such as music technology, music business, and etc. The problem is I come from a family that wants their kids to be in practical and big money-making jobs. \\n\\nAs a result, I gave up my plans and I went to community college (which I am grateful about going to). Even though it was a nice way to introduce me to college academics, I was kinda rushed by advisors to pick a specific major so that I can transfer to pursue a bachelors. \\n\\nAt first in my second year of college, I majored in communications because I thought it would combine both the entertainment industry and business (which is my main alternative) together. However, I changed into business (specifically marketing) just immediately around two days at the beginning of the year because of certain classes, it made social media not fun, and I was afraid that it would not make enough money. Also, I was taking a few business classes ever since senior year at high school, so I was too used to being in business.\\n\\nAfter taking specific business classes, they were literally some of the hardest classes I took. I usually get good grades, but some of these I had to take twice and/or barely pass with a C. What made it worse was that in January 2020, that was the first time I actually thought of wanting to die (but I am not suicidal anymore, so please don’t worry about that). As a result, I ended up getting my associate’s degree a semester late. \\n\\nI am about to be in my senior year this fall and I am currently doing well grade-wise and even have a scholarship. However, at this point, I have been so unmotivated with academics. It’s like post-secondary education was never something I should have done in the first place. My unmotivation and depression is so bad that classes that do involve the arts do not even make me happy. \\n\\nThe coronavirus just proved my negativity towards college more since I had 1-2 years of college without the fun. But yet, returning to school on campus is just a horrible thought now. I might have around 1.5 to 2.5 years to finish, but it felt so long getting the associate’s already, this can feel long too. I also might not even be fully happy during graduation because I will feel salty about putting myself in this situation. \\n\\nI’ve never been the best person when it comes to making big, adult decisions (mostly because I come from a Asian-American immigrant family and other personal reasons), but I really need help. It’s like I know the best solution in my opinion is to drop out and work a full time job, but I cannot go for it because it would disappoint my family. Most of the men in my family are college dropouts, including my father who died last year; and most of the women in my family, including my mother, never went to college. That being said, I do not want to break my parents’ wishes, but I don’t want to keep giving up my happiness and self either. What should I do?', 'A scam call went off during an exam, so I tried to silence it, but it identified me as cheating when I was only trying to silence my phone. This is a big one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve studied in Environmental Science for my final exam for days and days. I knew the information at hand. When it came time to do the test, I was doing it as usual until my phone went off. I didn\\'t know I had it on in the first place. You know those scam calls regarding that \"You\\'re warranty has expired\"? I got just that during a test. I tried to silence it and resumed on with the test. I felt myself loads of dread from this as later, I got caught for \"Academic Dishonesty\" regarding cheating when really, I wasn\\'t even looking for answers. I was trying to silence my phone so I wouldn\\'t get caught. And even if my phone rang, that still counts as dishonesty according to my school.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo the reason why I\\'m writing this is because they\\'ve charged me as the criminal when I was just trying to silence a phone. I\\'m fully aware that phones aren\\'t allowed during an exam, but I had no interest in even touching it.  And even if I let my phone ring during an exam, I would\\'ve still got caught either way. At this point, what should\\'ve been academic dishonesty on my part becomes full on Educational Malpractice on theirs. If I had the money, I\\'d sue the school district in an heartbeat for educational injustice.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo make matters worse, this was my second offense for the term. The first offense, okay, I was actually looking at my notes and they had every right to frame me, BUT THIS IS FROM A SCAM CALL, AND I GOT FRAMED FOR IT. Sometimes, I\\'d even consider suicide from time to time, knowing I won\\'t get a job in the workforce in the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI just don\\'t know what to do now. I\\'m basically framed by the police at this point. Any advice to combat this? I\\'ve done everything that I could to prevent this from happening and it happened, over a scam call regarding my warranty expiring, and I don\\'t even own a car.', 'I completely blew my first semester, and I can\\'t even sign up for a second. How do I get out of this hole? I really need some guidance from somebody, anybody, because every time I talk to someone at my community college I just get rude and snarky comments, or they get me out of their office as fast as possible.\\n\\nThis year has been particularly brutal for me. The TL;DR is I was rejected immediately by my long distance SO shortly after being picked up at the airport, continued rejection romantically, just girl stuff. I\\'ve faced financial hardship I never thought I would have faced in my life, my car got repo\\'d, and I\\'m too stupid to keep a job where I have to interact with people.\\n\\nI\\'m on meds that make me feel braindead and it impairs my memory and cognitive ability. I can\\'t even add in my head anymore. I kept up for the first 2 weeks of this semester, then I stopped going. I couldn\\'t get out of bed because of the suicidal thoughts, the anxiety, and the fatigue. It\\'s gotten a lot better, but I\\'m not convinced it won\\'t happen again.\\n\\nI can\\'t sign up for this next semester because I still owe $400 for the books I didn\\'t even use, and those were in my car when it got repo\\'d (tried calling to find out who took the car, nobody ever got back to me). When I spoke to Financial Aid, they told me \"yeah you can\\'t attend until you pay it back, sorry\".\\n\\nI feel like an utter failure. I took a gap year to get myself mentally together, and that obviously didn\\'t work. I\\'m going to be 20 and my life has got *worse*.\\n\\nI want to go to college. I want to succeed. My body and the ill part of my mind doesn\\'t want to cooperate. A major depression diagnosis killed so many of my dreams. I can never work in government. I\\'ve been depressed for most of my life. It never goes away.', 'I kinda regret the last ten years of my life  I am currently in graduate school, and I feel like it\\'s the worst decision I\\'ve ever made.\\n\\nThe most important things to me now are my healthy, happiness, tribe, and stability. Grad school takes away all of those things in all of the ways. WHOOOOOOOOOOPS\\n\\nThere were severe interpersonal issues (a lab mate had serious emotional and behavioral problems, made everyone scared/extremely uncomf, sent threatening emails detailing evil schemes...) that were never resolved in the two years I was in that first lab, no matter how many personnel I spoke to. I learned fast from my experiences and other student stories that grad students are \"slaves and don\\'t matter\", their words... I changed from PhD to the MS program, because I was soooo burnt out, but I wanted the previous two years to not be for nothing. I escaped the hostile lab and started all over in a different lab with a new project, new protocols, new people, new nuances, new everything.\\n\\nNow that graduation is within the year, it sucks that my summation of my overall experience is basically bitterness, disgust, resentment, disdain, disappointment, and debt. The tribulations squelched the joy and fulfillment of gaining knowledge and experiences. Don\\'t even get me started on how it\\'s not worth the money I\\'ll be spending years paying back.\\n\\nI think about how I could have had a real job for this last decade and made a sweet career for myself. When I graduate, in the life and times of \\'rona, the job market may be less than ideal. I feel stupid that I suffered for so long, for a pipe dream that has now collapsed because it was all a facade.\\n\\nI\\'m ashamed that I make $1300/month during Fall/Spring semesters (for teaching) and $982/mo (teaching) June/July (>30 hrs/wk). I feel like I wasted my youth trying to become something great, but I became tired and kinda hopeless. (I\\'m leaving out a lot of self-development.) I was never suicidal before grad school, but I have been since I started (I have a therapist and support.\"It\\'s the *feeling* \\'I am so overwhelmed I just want this to end\\'\" as my therapist very well put it.)\\n\\nI am grateful I had the opportunity: the purpose of this post is to vent about how absolutely not worth it emotionally and psychologically (and ultimately physically) college is. Although, this fits into a bigger picture of not being able to get jobs without degrees now, inflation, etc., etc...\\n\\nTL;DR: I fucking hate grad school, why did I do this? Huge waste of health, time and money. Will I even get a job?', 'Should I not do college?? This is a weird situation for me because I really don’t know where everything is going anymore.\\n\\nSo I’m a music major at a community college, hoping to transfer to a higher up music university— and It’s only been three weeks and I’m ready to start crying. It’s not even my major classes, it’s my liberal arts math class.\\n\\nI know the content already because I’ve learned it already in high school— but I just flunked a quiz i’m pretty sure and I know I can’t get an A in the class anymore.\\n\\nI walk into the class— realize I don’t have my homework because I didn’t take a picture of the new syllabus he put on the screen, and I don’t even know what i’m turning in. Panic ensues, I have terrible anxiety and I couldn’t focus on anything for the first ten minutes of class. He passes out our quizzes and then he calls me out in front of the entire class and asks me why I don’t have my homework in, and I’m ready to just cry at that point. I say I just don’t have it, and he gives a snarl and just disappointment back and at that point I just wanted to die. I’ve been suicidal in the past and that’s just one thing that really hit me. I couldn’t focus on my quiz even though I knew all of the content, I’m missing a homework assignment that I cannot makeup. And the highest I’ll ever get in that math class is a B, if I can still muster up effort.\\n\\n\\nI walked to the bus stop, went home, didn’t even go to my second class, and just cried on my bed. Maybe it’s overreacting, but I don’t think I can handle this. It really did feel like I was thrown into college by my family and just everything that’s happened recently in life and I’m not even doing college for me at this point.\\n\\nAlso I definitely was putting myself in danger because of my depression after that, and I kept stopping in the middle of crosswalks because I wanted to get hit right then and there. This isn’t healthy for me and I’m terrified it’s going to happen again from the same class or from a different class and I hate how I can’t cope with this shit normally and just go on with my day.', 'Why keep going Title. I don\\'t see a reason for trying in school anymore, and to a broader extent life itself. The burnout, indifference to learning, not retaining what I learn, etc. is too much. I think I hate my major. I just want to do media editing, but am trapped in these bullshit prerequisite courses where I learn all these boring things about film theory and social justice that don\\'t relate to it. I need to get through these courses to get to the upper division editing ones, and fuck me I don\\'t even know if I\\'ll like them once I get there. I don\\'t want to direct student films, or work alongside exhausting student creatives/auteurs, or pick up a million unrelated, unpaid internships just to stay competitive in the job market, but my degree basically demands it. I guess I owe this all to my shitty planning...well, that and college is a scam. I wish someone warned me.\\n\\nSo, I have to get so far into my major to actually experience classes I *might* like, and if I don\\'t, then switching majors from that point on will be a massive waste of time and money I don\\'t have. No backup major or anything of course, unless I\\'m prepared to go hungry. And that\\'s just college; I\\'m so fucking unprepared for the real world. It takes all the effort I can muster just to get all As in classes. I\\'ve got nothing else. There\\'s no positives in my life anymore, and if there\\'s no positives, why keep going? Tell me, I legitimately need some reasons to not take the easy way out of this bullshit. This post is just me narrowing down if there *are* some left. Don\\'t post that dumbass suicide hotline, it\\'s intensely unhelpful, almost makes me want to do it out of spite. How do you keep going?\\n\\nBut first, please don\\'t bother with the \"it will get better\" pep talk. That\\'s a lie people have been telling me for ~10 years now and I hate it. I\\'m downright resentful of it. My school\\'s mostly back to normal next semester, but because I\\'ve been absorbed by the amorphous blob-like thing called online school I don\\'t know if I can adapt. \\n\\nMy peace of mind is ruined; Physical classes means I\\'ll have to commute to them. What are the three most nerve-wracking activities I\\'ve ever experienced? Driving in general; people are assholes, working shitty retail to pay for my insurance, and stressing through all the errands my mom will inevitably make me do. \\n\\nMy sleeping schedule is ruined; how the fuck do I adjust to early classes after a year of asynchronous ones. \\n\\nMy study habits are ruined; I can\\'t imagine memorizing things for a test anymore when they\\'ve all been open-book for so long. I think online school actually gave me ADHD- my attention span is shot and I can\\'t pay attention to anything. All I have is blind hope that it disappears when physical classes arrive. \\n\\nMy social life is preemptively ruined; Making friends online is and has always been a farce. Everyone\\'s too hesitant and everything feels too awkward. I don\\'t know my school, I don\\'t know kids in my major. I *do* know I\\'m not going to have time for socializing and clubs once back because I now know the college workload is unreasonable. Nevermind I\\'m socially stunted to begin with. \\n\\nI hate online classes with a passion. I want to get away from them, but it\\'s very likely I\\'m exchanging one shitshow for another by transitioning to physical. Different stressors, same quantity of them. Don\\'t tell me things will get better. I understand as strangers you can\\'t promise me many things with substance behind them, so instead of posting empty encouragement (#wegotthisfam #slayit), I\\'d rather you just not post anything at all.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t bother to suggest therapy. I\\'ve always been a little suicidal, but until this semester I never felt desperate enough to need therapy for it. What did I find when I looked for help? My school\\'s counseling program has a 50/50 chance of actually helping me, or locking me up in an institution that could only make me hate life more. I can\\'t take those odds. School counselors are always trying to push you out to private therapists anyways. \\n\\nI looked up those- I was *gently* told to fuck off by one organization in the consultation call because I couldn\\'t afford the standard 12 weeks of sessions (~$1000). Fucksakes, I only wanted a few. Low-cost organizations are happy to have me...if I can wait 3-4 months. I wish they told me to fuck off too, honestly, because it\\'s not like most people desperate enough to seek out therapy can just *cope* with their shit for that long no problem. \\n\\nI discovered therapy in the U.S. is as much a joke as our traditional healthcare is: available but too expensive, or inexpensive but always unavailable. It\\'s not an option, for me at least. Finding that out after so, so many people said it\\'s worked wonders for them, hurt. It really hurt.\\n\\nBut, at risk of going beyond subreddit parameters, how do you keep going in life? I like to think I\\'ve \"accepted\" that I\\'ll never live up to my unrealistic pipedreams, or that I won\\'t find love, or have my own place, etc. but I still get sad over these things. I don\\'t know what it\\'s like to be content with life, but so many others do and persevere through the bullshit under worse circumstances than me. How? just how?', \"Still bitter and depressed but won't quit TL:DR: High-performing high school student. Got rejected by almost every school. Fell into a depression that killed the chances of a transfer. Still bitter and upset at the derailing of my life plan. Hopefully will finally get back on track by getting into grad school. Sorry for being a douchey downer. \\n\\nHello all.\\n\\nI don't really have a good reason for posting about this and I'm sure it'll come off as a pity party (I suppose it actually is one) but I'm feeling sad again and don't have anything to take my mind off it. All my life I'd been told I'd get into any school I wanted, that I was a genius, how jealous people were that I could skate by classes. I really thought I'd get into a great school and be put on the path towards the only job I've ever wanted in my entire life: POTUS.\\n\\nI'm a first-gen American and college student so I didn't really know anything about the process. I took my first LSAT in June of my junior year, panic took the subject tests which I bombed (probably part of why I did poorly) and took an ACT in November of my senior year. I ended up doing well on the SAT and ACT, with a 1490 and 34. I had a good GPA, not great: 3.7. I had good extracurriculars, including a focus in the arts. I passed 10 AP tests, including a self-study. At worst, I thought I'd get into a T25 undergrad.\\n\\nLooking back on it, when I was applying for schools I was grossly misinformed because of my background. I didn't even realize majoring in Business was popular. I thought because MBAs exist, everyone just went to Business school instead. I ended up picking a major at random because I was good at Math and it seemed interesting. That ended up being a huge mistake as it turns out, I despised the culture of the students. I only really knew about the schools that I'd read about or heard of from books and movies, like Harvard or Stanford.\\n\\nI remember that my parents actually paid for a meeting with an admissions guide who told me I wouldn't get in where I wanted. I thought he was such a pompous asshole but he turned out to be the Oracle of Delphi in disguise.\\n\\nI applied to 11 schools, including many where I was over the 75% percentile of their GPA and SAT/ACT. As people's acceptances started rolling through, I saw more and more of my peers get into their dream schools. Not to be an asshole, but some of them I'd shared classrooms with and was a little surprised to hear of their outcomes. Nonetheless, I patiently waited, expecting to be put on the path toward my dreams. Then something I never would have expected in a million years happened.\\n\\nI got rejected by almost every single school I applied to. I can still feel the shame and pain reading the emails brought me. Sometimes I still tear up when I think about it or hear about other people getting into awesome schools. I was left with the choice of a mediocre (putting it nicely) commuter state school and a bad large public school (without a lot of money). I only got waitlisted by one school, one where before all of this happened I thought I'd never have to even consider. I didn't even get off of their list.\\n\\nI cried. I cried a lot. I got severely depressed to the point that, for the first time in my life, I just gave up. I stopped turning in schoolwork and stopped doing anything productive. I nearly flunked my senior year because of it (shoutout to some amazing teachers who let me turn in work late).\\n\\nI started to suffer from passive suicidal ideation as I realized that my dreams were essentially dead. There's a saying that an athlete dies twice: once when they can no longer play their sport and a second when they actually pass. It feels like I died when that last rejection came. I'm a husk of that person. I can't even imagine what my younger self would have said if he'd seen what we'd end up as. He'd be so fucking upset and it breaks my heart to think of how pathetic I look.\\n\\nI'm sure I can guess what some of you are asking: why would you panic? Why not just transfer. Because of my AP credits, I started with nearly 53 units. I thought this meant I wasn't allowed to transfer which then caused me to torpedo my entire first year of my college. By the time I found out that I could transfer, the damage was done. I had <3.0 GPA for the first time in my life. There was no way that I'd be able to get into a good school.\", 'Ya know I wish I studied art (Sorry this is a long one)I started college off as Neuroscience Pre-med major. Why? Because when I was in high school, all I was ever told was that art will never make you money. You’ll be broke and unhappy and need to work at McDonalds just to get by with a degree that won’t pay the bills. Your better off if you choose a major that will make a 6 figure salary. \\n\\nSo I did. I was hoping to use my Neuroscience degree to go to med school and study to be a psychiatrist, because I love the studying the human psyche. It’s just so incredibly interesting, so I figured hell why not? It’ll make me 100k or more and I’ll be doing something cool. But then I started on this pre-med track and almost killed myself. I slaved away for an entire year only to get to my spring semester and wonder if I should just drop out. I was completely unhappy, and taking a bunch of class just so that I could be qualified enough to pass the MCAT. Yet if you asked me if I even remember what I studied the answer would be “NO”. I had migraines for the first time ever, I had ludicrous back pain from all the expectations I placed on myself, and I’ve never cried more in one year than I have in my whole life. So I remembered my life goals and realized that “hey all I want to do own my cafe one day, what am I doing Neuroscience even for?” And then I changed my major.\\n\\nBut I then figured changing it to Finance and International Business would get me the foot in the door to owning my cafe and making me 100k plus as a bonus. So I started on this business track as a double major and you know what happened? I was incredibly unhappy again. At this point in my life, death truly was a plausible option. I figured if life was so hard, why not just die? Wouldn’t that be easier? Life isn’t that awesome that I need to live, I couldn’t give a damn frankly. I just couldn’t figure out what was going wrong.\\n\\nWhat’s ironic was that this whole time I was doing art, drawing like a madman. It was the only escape I had from the endless slew of classes that I hated. I was attempting to draw my own manga, because I love creating stories and have before. And like before, I thought “hey, why are you even a business major? You don’t need a business degree to own a business” and I was fucking furious with myself. I went on Reddit and found people disproving my expectation of art not being a plausible degree option. I found people saying you don’t even need a 6 figure salary to live comfortably. SO WHAT THE HELL WAS I DOING?\\n\\nYet before I knew it, a year and half had passed and I had learned so much to amount to so little. Now I’m struggling with financial aid since I’ve failed another class, and I’ve had to be reinstated. My graduation date is 2 extra years out from when I was supposed to graduate. And I sit back and wonder “what if I started with art to begin with?” Would my life be so full of exhausting reminders of my mistakes? \\n\\nI decided to go into a more creative field, and no, not a fine art degree. Due to the fact that I don’t want to fully major in art, as despite living drawing and creating, I don’t do it often enough to want to make a degree out of it. I feel as though if I did that, I’d come to hate doing art. Therefore I chose another degree that utilizes art in a field that I’ve always found fascinating. I’m in between being a Landscape Architecture major, and Interior Design major, or an Architecture major. \\n\\nWhy? Because, I like to change things. I love creating spaces, ever since I was forced to learn how to draw a cube in elementary school. I love asking myself “how different could I make something fit in this space?”. Traditionalism is lost on me, and I like to challenge the idea of sameness. Why leave something as is when it can be different and potentially better?(*⁰▿⁰*)\\n\\nSo despite my financial trouble with the school for me trying to make up for my past mistakes that I’ve made in the last year and half of my life, my only regret is not starting with art. But I hate having regrets so I’m going to try and make up for these mistakes and actually do what I want to do. So maybe that this last year and half doesn’t serve as a reminder to my failures, depression, and suicidal ideation, cuz man what an exhausting year it was.\\n\\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk and hell of anyone sees this, maybe we could chat about your experiences if you could relate to this.(￣▽￣)\\n\\nTL;DR: this is an entire post about why I didn’t chose art as my first major in college and wasted a year and half of my life and how I’m now attempting to make up for my mistakes.', 'Anyone else feel like college reopening plans do not care about students mental health? Measuring the impact of COVID-19 is more than just the death count. The virus can cause lingering health problems as studies have shown it could be a [vascular disease](https://www.google.com/amp/s/elemental.medium.com/amp/p/2c4032481ab2). The US has experienced a [three fold increase in depression rates after the pandemic arrived.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770146) I hate to use human lives in game theory, but I am very frustrated as a college student to see policies drawn out to prevent at risk and vulnerable populations who may only have a few years left to live get priority over young people who have much more time to live. Depression is a serious issue amongst many students, and I am afraid suicide rates will increase partly due to this “new normal”. \\n\\nIt is very clear that in person communication is better than anything online; college students overwhelmingly said in internal surveys that they prefer in person classes and would like to return to campus this fall. However, this is not want students wanted at all. There is a reason why college students are breaking the rules, they are incredibly strict. There is an obvious tradeoff in increased mental health issues amongst people when it comes to enforcing these new strict rules, but this has been ignored for some reason. \\n\\nI am not advocating for massive parties with outside guests. I just believe there is a more healthy medium for college students to go to small gatherings without putting at risk populations in danger. The CDC says someone is only a close contact after [15 minutes of being someone closer than six feet to you,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-tracing.html) then no one at risk (professors, employees) should be getting infected if proper precautions are taken with capacity limits and proper sanitation methods. \\n\\nIf you do not want to get infected for whatever reason, you can stay in your dorm room or apartment and if there are proper protocols in place you will not get infected. To people who want to be able to socialize without all of the restrictions, there should be a way to do so without the possibility of transmitting out of the student population. \\n\\nI find it incredibly unfair to students to have the only measure of success being how many cases your school has. This is not looking at the full picture, and by having so many restrictions, it may be causing more harm than good.', 'I\\'m very lonely even tho I try everything to get friends on the campus 😭 Edit : I MAYBE HAVE SOME [POSITIVE NEWS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/pqvom5/update_im_very_lonely_even_tho_i_try_everything/)!!! YAAAY! 🥰🥰🥰\\n\\nSome of you describe it something that\\'s easy. Well maybe it is when you already have the skill for it. But for now, I try to do everything to get friends but I didn\\'t find them yet.\\n\\nSometimes even finding the places where you can socialise can be difficult. Especially when you didn\\'t do it that much before and there\\'s no easy method that you know of. I wish how to socialise would be taught at school.\\n\\nHere\\'s the issues : First, I\\'m autistic and so it\\'s sometimes harder to communicate. Second, I\\'m at a place where I don\\'t know any \"student associations\". I don\\'t live in the US, and at the college style called \"DUT\" in France, here\\'s how it works : while I\\'m in a campus, I\\'m also basically always only next to the people of my own education, programming.\\n\\nThere\\'s like 200 students at programming. Not that much. They\\'re basically classmates. I actually do talk to them and with some I actually make some small groups where we talk together during the recess time. But most of them are kinda occupied outside of school or just don\\'t want to hang out and so I can\\'t become real friends with them in real life.\\n\\nThere is a campus but yeah during recess we only talk to the people of the same department. There\\'s no place for anyone to hang out. At least not one where my classmates went. There are the places where the people of other departments who study other things go. But they\\'re usually in groups of friends and I think it\\'d be weird if I approached someone and tried to become a friend. I even tried, but like I\\'ve never seen them again. And it\\'s a shame that for now I only talk to people from my department because it looks like it\\'d be cool to talk to a more diverse range of people. For example there\\'s almost no girls in my department and I would like more gal friends.\\n\\nI don\\'t really know if in all of the campus there\\'s any such student activities. At best there\\'s online activist groups. I\\'ve never heard about any of that. Maybe I\\'ll try to ask more but I\\'d be surpsided if there are. I mean there\\'s a library but that\\'s about it. And also even if there were, when would the students evcen go there? Going on the campus on the weekend when we want to be finally rest after school? Or at 6PM when we also have 1 hour to commute? Idk, but unfortunately my college isn\\'t some Hogwards fairytale. Actually, because of my loneliness it feels like a nightmare.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s not at all better outside of school. yeah I don\\'t go at any activities like sports yet, and I\\'ll try that. But honestly what if I won\\'t like the activity? It has been hard finding a place for socialising with people of similar interest of me. Should I go to an activity where I won\\'t understand anything just for socialising? And also I don\\'t drink and don\\'t really know how to socialise at bars or cafes either.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s also way harder when this loneliness has alreasy been a big problem of mine during the summer holidays, but now it all didn\\'t become better, but actually worse because now I have to think of all that stressful, very anxious and extremely difficult actual LESSONS and I have 8 hours a day of them! So I have way less time for even trying to socialise with my already existing classmates. And it\\'s also harder when BECAUSE of the lessons I have less time, I become more irritated and visibly anxious and it\\'s even LESS possible to become friends with the people I already know (Last year, I even had a problem where I started ranting about some stupid political shit because of that)!\\n\\nI also don\\'t really like my lessons even tho I thought I\\'d like programming too, but that\\'s too complicated to explain here.\\n\\nTL;DR : I try everything to find friends but usual advice haven\\'t worked for me, at least yet, It\\'s not that easy and I don\\'t have that much practise :(\\n\\nHonestly, my life just seems the worst that it could be! 😢 I just hate everything and honestly sometimes I even have suicidal thoughts but often I dream of just never ever studying in my life ever again! Or at least to finally be happy and actually hang out with someone 😭', 'My University is Overpriced My University is dreadfully overpriced for many reasons. I go to an Ivy League. I\\'m not saying the name since I still want to graduate. Considering the amount of mental and physical damage I have endured in this abusive school, they should be paying me more. I\\'ve had a plethora of incompetent professors, many arrogant, gas lighting professors. I literally had one ask to pay for my freaking wi-fi over the pandemic. So uncalled for, incredibly invasive and insensitive. One asked a poorer student why they didn\\'t buy the books yet a week into the semester  in front of the whole class and they had to say they couldn\\'t afford them yet. I\\'ve had two professors call me lazy, one suggest I go to the office of disability just because I asked to take a quiz in her office (an arrangement I had with a previous professor or the same subject.) One prof would get up and sit next to me every class, even though I tried to sit as far away from them as possible. Another would give me the turkey neck confused face whenever I asked a question in class. I straight up had to say \"yeah, seriously\" before he would answer my questions. I had a couple near death experiences (because I became very ill and almost died) and I had hoped my professors would try to be a bit flexible with my grades and stuff, but they told me to drop their classes instead. And this is just the professors and it\\'s not even all the stories I have on them.\\n\\nOther than the professors, the student community is toxic as hell. The perfectionism is overkill. Students dick measure by asking how many hours you\\'ve slept a night. If you have a healthy sleep schedule, you\\'re not working hard enough. If they don\\'t see you in the library until 1AM at least twice in the semester, you must not be working hard enough. If you don\\'t feel the need blackout drunk once a week, you must not be working hard enough. If you aren\\'t trying to go vegetarian or vegan, you must not be working hard enough to save the world. If you don\\'t go to protests, you must not be working hard enough to save the world. If you get a B in a class, you must not be working hard enough. If you don\\'t have color coded notes, you must not be working hard enough. Don\\'t even get me started on the hookup culture, it\\'s wild af.\\n\\nNow for some miscellaneous stuff that damn near broke my soul once I finally became depressed from this oppressive atmosphere. My dorm didn\\'t have heat in the winter. The vending machines charge you 6 dollars for a small bag of Doritos (what a mockery to poorer students). The dining halls aren\\'t good at labelling things for food allergies. One of my friend\\'s nearly died a week into my first year because of this. There are few mental health resources that I know of despite the school having one the highest suicide rates in the country. General conversations between students and even staff are excruciatingly shallow. I asked to make a bakery and my Head of College, suggested I do a coffee shop with \"avocado on toast\". She knew already that I\\'ve never tasted coffee in my life. It was a big point in the conversation prior to this moment.\\n\\nOk, I\\'m done--Oh! Yeah, I caught covid and had to withdrawal, but the policies are keeping me from reenrolling. lol bye\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT\\n\\nTL;DR : Many of the professors suck, student community sucks, no care for mental or physical health. Not worth the money.', \"I am not happy I've had these thoughts and feelings bottled up since before college and it's getting to dangerously high levels so I need to vent my frustrations now more than ever.\\n\\nI'm not a bright guy. Even before college, I was always struggling with my studies because I am a slow learner. I'm also not very sociable. I have trouble making friends and, even if managed to make a few, I feel as though I don't deserve it. Nobody wants to be friends a potato. To add fuel to the fire, I'm also a huge procrastinator. Combine these together and something nasty will come out of it, i.e. Me. And after getting into college, those three things have continued to get worse. Missing classes and assignments, not being able to understand the lectures, feeling as though everyone is two steps ahead of you while you're still stuck on that last part, Having trouble with friends because they would rather hang with other people and, if they have no one to hangout with, you're their last option, which they don't like. If I had to compare me and my friends and classmates, I'd put them somewhere in, they're lazy, but smart. Whereas me, I'm lazy and stupid. \\n\\nAfter a miss hap with an assignment that was due that day, I went to a dark place. A really dark place. I'm gonna be straight, I searched up suicide reddit posts because, if I'm being frank, I really don't deserve any of this. Hell, I was only able to get into college because of my parents, and I feel like they deserve better, not some piece of shit like me. I've got siblings who are super hard working and are pretty good at what they do. So, what's to say they won't have a bright future, of course they are. I feel as though I was the mistake of my family and they only treat me nicely out of pity. \\n\\nCollege really sent me over the edge, and I don't know if I'll make it. I wanted to make my parents proud, but I'm just a failure in the worst ways possible. I am not happy, and I don't know if I ever will.  \\n\\nI would like to write more, but I can't think of any off the top of my, as sure I have alot more things I wanna say. \\n\", \"Feeling pretty screwed, not sure what to do. Alright, let me elaborate. Settle down, get cozy because I'm gonna need the info straight up and you're probably going to have to deal with me crying about it.\\n\\nI need options here. I was in Cal State Fullerton for about 3 years but had the worst depression I've had in my entire life. No friends, money, my girlfriend and only friend there broke up with me after about 2 years. Failed a large majority of my classes and my GPA is far below the rescue point. Brink of suicide, all of that\\n\\nMoved back home in San Diego, threw myself in to therapy for a last ditch option before I decided to jump off a bridge. Got really good help, got myself on some nice prescribed medication, and I have a stable minimum wage job and a decent amount of friends and support now.\\n\\nTook a couple of community college classes, didn't really do well in them either. TBH it's sorta hard to be motivated to do better when your track record is as bad as mine was. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. People say I'm smart but I just can't bring myself to care enough sometimes, I already feel like I'm crawling out of a 10 foot hole I dug myself.\\n\\nI talked to a college counselor for options. He was pretty straight with me: I can't really transfer to UCSD or SDSU with the GPA I have. I'd have to go to a CSU in the middle of literally nowhere, California. The kind of schools that literally beg students to join. The issue is, well. I'd be going back to the middle of nowhere, to be depressed and without the friends I've made. I wouldn't have the current job I have that at least pays.\\n\\nThe counselor told me my other option were schools like National University, or University of Phoenix. Basically accredited schools with horrible reputations for being degree mills anyways.\\n\\nThe other sitch is my fucking health insurance is gonna go out if I'm not in school. And THAT is where the fear is really drawn out. No more meds and no more of my current therapist will send me in to a state of disarray that I'm not confident to tackle. My therapist says she wants to work with me still and is going to try to work some things out so we can continue seeing each other even if the worst comes, but her current advice is to look in to the aforementioned schools so I can keep my health insurance with my parents, and also to find a better job in San Diego.\\n\\nI just don't think I'd care to go to a school who's degree is worthless anyways. I'm a CS major, if that helps.\\n\\nJust wondering what some strangers think I should do.\", 'Suffering Through Spring Semester I\\'m a senior in an esteemed private university in my state. The type of university where, when I tell people I go there, they say things like *oh, you\\'re* ***smart***. I thought I was before I attended college. But I\\'m suffering so hard it\\'s honestly amazing. I can\\'t focus anymore or manage my time. Like, at all. My entire family suffers from ADHD-like symptoms, but we come from a community where people don\\'t believe in ADHD, so I\\'ve never been able to get tested, and my university\\'s counseling center refuses to help me get tested for it. My doctor doesn\\'t believe me either. \\n\\nI just want to focus. I want to be able to manage my time without having to constantly focus on the clock. And don\\'t get me started on what my counselor assumes is C-PTSD, which causes nightmares so bad I\\'m afraid to sleep some nights. This spring break, I was supposed to catch up on all of my work, but instead, I\\'ve been unable to actually get myself to do anything because I\\'m too tired and can\\'t focus at all. My mental health is on a sharp decline. Just last semester, I got so bad that I drafted up a suicide plan, and though I\\'m not nearly as bad this semester, I want to scream. I can\\'t keep up with this workload. And I\\'ve missed so much class already that if I miss more, I\\'ll start dropping grade levels. I can\\'t get any accommodations because I don\\'t have a diagnosis for anything because my doctor thinks I\\'m pretty much just hysterical. I thought I was hearing voices the other week, but it turns out it was just my drug addict neighbor and his girlfriend shouting at all hours (I\\'m hard of hearing, so I can\\'t figure out what direction sound comes from, and it was happening nearly around the clock, so I thought I was fucking crazy). I don\\'t think my anxiety meds are working anymore. When I visit my doctor on Friday, he\\'s going to chastise me for *giving into my agoraphobia* for being too depressed/anxious/fucking poor to leave the house often and adjust my meds, so more insomnia for me, right ahead of academic conference season, where I\\'m attending two conferences in as many weeks and missing two weeks of class, out of state for both, so I was *supposed* to catch up on work this week and work ahead for the weeks I\\'m missing, but that didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nGas is $4, I drive a shitty car from the 90s that costs $40 to fill up the entire tank when gas is at a *good* price, and I live 30 minutes from my university. My laptop is so broken that my mic doesn\\'t work anymore, so distance learning isn\\'t a good idea for me since I can\\'t participate in class discussions. My  Sunday D&D group won\\'t tell me if we have our session tomorrow or not, and I feel like shit if I miss a session because I\\'m one of the only people who roleplays, and my Monday D&D group is canceled because my best friend/DM is out of the country on a trip for class. Everything is so much all the time right now and I can\\'t even think about how I\\'m going to be entering the job market as an underqualified recent graduate in May. My husband, bless him, helps, but he has chronic pain and regularly gets injured at his job, and he can\\'t drive, so *I* have to drive him to and from work and the doctor for when he gets hurt. If I don\\'t graduate this semester, that\\'s another $40,000+ to my university, and we can\\'t afford that. My main support professor is super busy right now, and I don\\'t want to bother any other professors, since it\\'s midterms, and I\\'m a grown-ass man. I should be able to handle myself. I graduated from high school with my Associate\\'s, for fuck\\'s sake, and I can\\'t handle my senior year? Really? When I was a senior in high school, I was so sick I couldn\\'t eat, I worked at least 30 hours a week, and I was in marching band on top of it, and that was before the pandemic began, where I worked almost 40 hours a week and closed for Subway. Now I\\'m getting sick again. Really sick. I can\\'t bring myself to eat anymore, and anyways, we can barely afford to eat because of all of my life-threatening allergies and how much food my husband eats. My face is starting to sink in like it did my last senior year. I have to drink so much caffeine to even be able to focus for a brief amount of time that it makes my entire body shake. \\n\\nI feel completely useless and broken. My brain is refusing to work, my body is shutting down, and I can\\'t even escape in my dreams because I only dream about my childhood beatings. The only time I can relax is when my husband is holding me or I\\'m writing (Creative Writing major). I\\'m a disappointment of a student and a husband, and I just want to curl up beneath my bed and die like the animal I am. I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I\\'ve exhausted every avenue I\\'ve tried. I\\'m sorry if this reads as too \"woe is me\". I\\'m just suffering really badly right now and I don\\'t know if I can handle it anymore.', 'Am I being stupid? **TL;DR College is the biggest waste of fucking time unless it\\'s fun, free, and you\\'re deadset on making money off of what you\\'re learning. Also American Society has set an entire generation up for failure.**\\n\\nBeing totally honest here if my tuition wasn\\'t paid for by Bright Futures I wouldn\\'t have even bothered with this bullshit. Florida education is only good for one thing... getting a job in Florida.\\n\\nWhen I was applying to Uni\\'s I was pretty much told \"I ain\\'t paying, you better get that scholarship\" by my single mother, so I ended up going to a shitty commuter school 40 min away from my house. She refuses to file the FAFSA cause she\\'s kind of batshit crazy (still love her tho). Going in I had no clue wtf I wanted to do. I ended up changing majors 4 times, starting with Computer Science to Biology to Psychology to Business Analytics and finally settling on Management Information Systems. Now going into my 4th year with 12 classes left which I\\'ll probably finish in 2 more years (5 years total in college) cause that\\'s how long my scholarship\\'ll be good for + it\\'s easier, don\\'t really care that much since I\\'ll still be graduating at 22.\\n\\nPoint is I fucking hate it here, I don\\'t spend much time on campus because\\n\\n* A. I just wanna go home or somewhere else, after class I always feel like I\\'ve spent too much time there\\n* B. It\\'s a shitty Florida University that doesn\\'t even have a football team (Every single U.S. University pumps most of their budget into their Sports teams. Considering that this is a Florida university we\\'re talking about that speaks volumes about the quality of education I\\'m receiving)\\n* C. I\\'ve always felt like I could\\'ve gone somewhere better If I went into more debt. Would\\'ve been a stupid idea considering how much I think College is a scam but ik it would\\'ve made a more enjoyable college experience.\\n\\nCause of my lack of campus involvement and a good amount of virtual classes (cause why waste gas driving 40 min to and back) I\\'ve pretty much made 0 friends here. I still hang out with homies from HS and some other peeps, but I literally have no incentive to go out of my way to talk to people. The clubs are also shit too, not much variety. Also doesn\\'t help that I see a lot of people I went to Highschool with, kinda makes the experience feel even more lame. The worst part is not only do these fucking vampires force most people into debt, they make us VOLUNTEER on top of it. Imagine being someone that takes out $6000+ in loans a year for a bullshit education along with working a job to pay rent while also being forced to do over 100 hours of volunteer work like you\\'re still in highschool. The real kicker here is that you\\'re not even guaranteed a job once you graduate, only 50% of graduates are employed. That just shows how much the boomers have leeched our opportunities, only 13% of those old retards went to college and they made more money in their prime than Millenial and Gen Z combined. This shit should be free. Paid for by the tax money that goes to the Military industrial Complex and Israel instead of the American People. If you don\\'t support free college you could say the same shit about Highschool, which BTW a College degree now is the same thing a Highschool degree was back in the 60\\'s and 70\\'s (back when it cost almost nothing). Too bad we live in an Oligarchy where politicians would rather give tax cuts to their corporate donors instead of giving us Healthcare.\\n\\nNow you may be wondering \"Why aren\\'t you taking advantage of campus networking?\" Well because I honestly don\\'t give two shits about my education. My reason for going to college was 50% parental pressure (Angry Cuban Father (who died when I was 12) was a dentist with an Ivy League degree and my mom has a bachelors in Bus. administration) and the other 50% me thinking It\\'d be stupid to skip out on the 100% free tuition I got for getting a 30 on my ACT.\\n\\nWere it up to me I would\\'ve majored in History. I\\'d actually feel engaged with what I\\'m learning + my biggest strength has always been writing. Why didn\\'t I do that? Waste of a scholarship. There\\'s two types of degrees: Degrees that force you into becoming a k-12 teacher or \"Job Training\" degrees that can get you a decent paying job (Engineering + Business). That being said I actually like learning about the Business world a lot, the information system aspect not so much. But the Truth is I don\\'t see myself making a career out of this degree at all. Fuck graduate school too as Sam Hyde once said \"Thats the loser route\", a massively expensive time waster. I\\'ve always hated school, why tf would I want more of it? I\\'d just wanna make money at that point.\\n\\nI believe in this life we either follow our dreams or we live out our lifespan. Working as a Systems Engineer sounds fucking boring. If I\\'m still having to write job applications in my mid 30\\'s that\\'s a big sign I didn\\'t work hard enough on my goals when I had youth. The 9-5 is Creative Suicide, fuck real jobs (btw before any of you call me lazy I worked retail from Sophomore to Junior year on top of taking 12 credits per semester, I HATED that shit XD ). In an ideal world I\\'m some famous Hideo Kojima guy who\\'s created a badass IP with comics, video games, anime, tabletop rpg\\'s, etc. (We\\'ll have to see how that turns out lol)\\n\\nI\\'ll probably work a job or two given by my degree (has to at least be 70k salary), until I have enough money to start working on my actual dreams. Who knows if Florida\\'s the right place for that though, opportunities and getting the right people to work with is all location dependent.\\n\\nBottomline is I think I\\'ve wasted a good 3 years of my life, going on 4.5 to 5 in the near future. College is what you make of it, and personally I haven\\'t made jack shit. Why? Cause it really wasn\\'t for me. Also let\\'s be real here EVERY single thing you learn in college could be learned online or through books, even better if you find the right person who can teach you the skills necessary to follow your dreams. MENTORS > COLLEGE. A burden will be lifted off my shoulders once I graduate, I\\'ll probably have more time for personal endeavors. Hopefully whatever job my degree gives me doesn\\'t completely suck that away from me.

You don’t have to worry about me bothering you ever again. \\n\\nI’m sorry if I have made your life worse these past four years. I’m sorry if I have uncomfortable, if I have annoyed you, bored you, scared you. It seems like that’s all I do these days. You are always polite and good to me but, lately, whenever I speak with you I feel like you can’t wait to get away from me. Do you dread talking to me? Yesterday it seemed like it. I hadn’t spoken to you in person in over a year, and you are my advisor. I try hard to always give you an “out,” to be respectful of your time, to look for cues that you are bored. \\n\\nThere was a time when I thought you really liked talking to me. You even told me once “I like talking to you.” You always pointed out all the ways we were similar and others could see it too. You said you saw your younger self in me, you counseled and comforted me. You teased me in class and smiled wide when you saw me in the halls, and I did the same back to you. We talked about music and philosophy. You encouraged me to submit my papers to prize committees. \\n\\nYou told me it was nice to have me in class, because I was the only one who would talk sometimes and you hated silences. I always laughed at your jokes even when the others didn’t, and you always tended to look right at me when you lectured, probably because I was listening so attentively. \\n\\nI always did all the readings, and asked questions about them after class. I worked so hard on my papers. I got into a program at Oxford (the same one you went to) because of your recommendation, but then lost my spot because I failed my classes (were you disappointed, think less of me, after everything you did for me? I bet.)  You suggested books for me to read and I read them and we discussed them. You seemed to like doing this. You seemed to be grateful and happy. You initiated full blown conversations with me when you saw me outside of class (now you seem uncomfortable and eager to get away from me before I start talking). \\n\\nYou were the best thing that has ever happened to me. I’ve never admired or liked being around anyone more than you. You understood me it seemed in a way no one else did, despite being 30 years older than me. You said I couldn’t ever shock or scare you, when I apologized for confiding in you about my bipolar disorder. You said you had many bipolar friends throughout the years. You said “sometimes very smart people have very hard times.” \\n\\nA year later, I took another class with you and when I stopped turning in work you got concerned and contacted the Dean. I was doing badly, having flashbacks to my childhood sexual abuse at the time. I didn’t want to use it as an excuse but I wanted you to know. I should never have told you but I confided in you about my my sexual abuse. It felt so good. I had t told anyone at that point. But then it felt bad. I think I went to far. I didn’t ask for any extensions or any special assistance or comfort but I should never have told you. You didn’t need to know. I’m sorry. Maybe that’s when things really started to change. \\n\\nI did poorly in your class and other classes. I struggled and acted weird around you I think. I tried to avoid you for a few months. I became suicidal. I stopped going to classes. I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days during the middle of the semester. You found out. Everyone in found out. I tried to get things back to normal. I tried to get your attention back. \\n\\nNow you seem to try and avoid me. It’s subtle but I can tell. You are nice and polite to me still but your voice is flat and dry. Your laugh is fake. You literally check your email when I am talking to you. Your answers are short. I know I shouldn’t expect so much from you and I don’t expect it. Still, I desire it. Why do I try so hard to get it back when it’s clearly gone? Im very sorry. \\n\\nI really try hard to not be a bother. I really thought you genuinely enjoyed me, a bit, and wanted to talk but I need to let it go. My enthusiasm, my excitement about the subject, about literature no longer makes you want to share with me. It seems to irritate you. I will give up. It’s a losing battle. I’m a pathetic puppy dog. You probably think I want to end your marriage or something. I swear I don’t. If anything I want you to invite me to your house for a board game or something. I’m so lonely without a family. But that’s not your problem. Obviously. \\n\\nAnyway, I need to give up trying to get back the mentor mentee relationship we had. It was the most amazing and intense and beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced in 24 years and I’m sad it ended and I’m extremely angry with myself for ruining it. At least I hope I ruined it. The alternative is that it was never there to begin with. I’ll stick with the story that I ruined it. And I know things used to be different. I know something changed. I think I creeped you out. Showed too much interest. Hell, at one point I even told you I was worried I was getting “too attached” and needed to stop taking classes with you. Now I ruined everything. You probably think I’m a stalker. Not too mention I became dumber and less interesting. I’m grasping at straws now, trying to be smarter, more interesting, more appealing, more stylish (you always cared about fashion and aesthetics) just to get your attention back. I need to give up. You clearly dislike me and don’t want to talk to me. Im sure you wish you didn’t have to advise me. I’m so sorry. \\n\\nI asked your colleague, your good friend (a female), if I was crossing any boundaries or annoying you in any way and they said I was fine and that you only ever had good things to say about me and that they would let me know if I overstepped any boundaries. I told her I sometimes was bad at understanding etiquette and picking up on cues and boundaries, and she said she thought I was actually especially sensitive and attuned to those things, and in fact worried almost too much about bothering others. \\n\\nI hope she’s right but either way it’s clear you want little to do with me. There’s no going back. You have your own life. I am not entitled to anything more from you than a grade and support on my academics.', 'no idea what im doing with myself 2nd year of college, only took two classes this semester, now im going to have to go to community college. Dont get me wrong, its not like CC is fucking bad or something, but the reason why my parents are making me go isnt even bc they\\'re assholes or whatever, i am for a fact, part of the fucking problem. i guess for preface, last year as freshman, do decently first semester, get girlfriend, fall genuinely in love with her, cool. next semester, 3 weeks in, she breaks it off, and tht fucking launches my not-too-bad-depression of 5 years into fuckin hyperdrive. stop attending classes. literally want to fucking die, hate my self, and bc im obviously failing the fuck out of my classes, fucking spirals even harder. tips to the point where i tried to hang myself twice right before spring break, cus no way did I want to go home (really fucking hate being at home, when i was a kid id always get into huge blowout fights with them literally at least twice a week. my parents and i never fucking resolved our issues, so while we love eachother, i cant stand being with them, or near them. I hate living at home and i would unironically rather live and die on the fucking street. everytime i hop into my car, i pray to god i die in a car accident; i consider myself to be a religious person as well. just trying to give u the scope of how much i hate homelife.) so i spend me whole second semester in my room, fucking boiling in my on self hatred and despair and whatever the fuck, gain a literal 40 fucking pounds, and the finally fucking go home for the summer. U know i try my goddamned hardest to avoid the conversation of grades, until finally, the letter comes. Hey, ur kid fucked up. Fuck. finally tell them about everything thts been going on, even the suicide attempts, bc at this point i dont give a fuck about anything or anyone. if u cant tell from earlier, i NEVER talk to my parents about anything of substance. and being the fucking asian \"boomers\" they are (my fellow yellows know wht i mean) they dont understand shit, and just make fun of me for trying to kill myself. dont get me wrong, i fully fucking expected that, but tht shit still hurt. They didnt give a fuck. about a week goes by, not muhc happening, and then my fucking dad just starts shitting on me, for wanting and imma quote exactly what i said, \"\\\\[wanting\\\\] to be alone sometimes.\" he literally responded with \"SO YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST FORGET AND ABANDON YOUR FUCKING FAMILY LIKE THAT?!?\" what the fuck? i just wanted to be left alone sometimes? which means i want to jsut forget my fucking family? the fuck kind of bullshit? anyways. ive had fucking enough. text my best freind (who didnt know until i texted her, and i broke her heart in a fight the day before my ex brokeup with me) im done, as a last favor, treat yourself right (cus boy, she has hella issues. not tht im judging lmao). she calls the fucking cops, who wheel me away in an ambulance. spend the night in a hospital, before spending the next ten days in a fucking mental institution. place gave me some perspective, and FINALLY after (at the time) 19 years, i finally fucking told my parents how EXACTLY i feel, how much i fucking HATE my father, etc etc, all the edgy shit.  fast forward fall of 2019, taking 2 classes bc everyone knows academically i am not even close to ready to being full time again. do pretty decently in the beggining, get a dog for the first time (whom i love beyond fucking reality), kindof mend my relationship with my parents, and then right before christmas, meet this nice girl, and now were dating very casually (im genuinely afraid that ill fall in love with her like the last one then have my heart broken again. breaking up amicably is one thing, but to just be cut away is pretty fucking terrible.) and now, ive gotten C\\'s in those two classes, which, yea, not good, but still. so now, my options are to fund my broke, out of work ass, or go to CC. again, I aint bashing CC, im fucking going lol. been back on tht fuckin spiral since this winter break started, and honestly back to having an incredibly powerful death wish. only dont wanna die cus i cant do my dog dirty like that, or my gf. fuckingfuck dudes. it feels marginally fucking better to physically type this shit out. sorry this shit is long as hell. have a good semester guys.', 'I am deformed and disgusting I am deformed and disgusting\\n\\nLol I don’t even know where to start...\\nI’m an 18 year old freshman in college with issues you’ve never heard of. I need to get this off my chest and I have have no one to talk to bc no one else has to deal with this shit. \\n\\nPlease feel free to message me if you’ve dealt with some of the same things or something similar!💕\\n\\nI have tuberous breasts which is a congenital deformity where one’s breasts do not develop correctly. It may not seem like a big deal but it has made me consider suicide on multiple occasions and I suffer mentally every second of every day. I got a breast augmentation a few months ago but I still feel worthless because I had to have plastic surgery in order to look somewhat normal. I will never be considered naturally pretty and I hate myself more than anything for it. I got into an argument with my friend a few weeks ago. She told me to “have fun with my fake tits” she’s one of the only people that knows I’ve had surgery and I will remember what she said for the rest of my life. I also had enlarged labia but I had a labiaplastay (when they cut off your labia minora) because it made me extremely insecure in intimate situations. My doctor ended up fucking it up so now I have to get a revision surgery. Every guy I’ve been intimate with has stopped talking to me after we had sex and I’m convinced it’s because of the way I look. I’ve had guy friends make jokes about girls with “roast beef pussies” and I know that the guys I’ve had sex with thought the same way even though they never directly said anything to me. I also had a really bad eating disorder that resulted in me being placed in a residential facility for one month and two months of outpatient treatment. I was called fat in middle school and decided to lose weight. I also wanted to be really skinny so it would “balance out” the fact that I’m deformed. I hoped that boys would think “alright she may be ugly as fuck but at least she’s skinny.” I felt like I needed to punish myself by taking laxatives and not eating because my boobs and vagina were ugly. I also punished myself when guys stopped talking to me out of nowhere. I would starve myself for days, take up to 40 laxatives, and cut myself. I still feel the need to punish myself because all I am is a fake ass bitch who’s had plastic surgery. I don’t take it to the extent I did before going to treatment because I thought I was legitimately going to die from taking laxatives when I took about 40. Every.single.day all I can think about is how deformed and fat I am. I’m 115 pounds and 5’5. You may not think I seem fat but I can 100% assure you that you’d want to puke if you saw me without clothes on. People probably can’t tell I’m disgusting when I have clothes on but when I don’t you can tell that I have a lot of stomach fat and that there’s scars under my boobs. I have given up on ever finding love because no one wants to date someone who is deformed. They also don’t want to date anyone who is fake (had plastic surgery) so basically I’m screwed either way. People tell me I’m pretty and I hate them because I know they’re only saying it to make me feel better. Since I’m never going to find love I’ve decided that all my time and energy needs to be focused on school so I can have a successful career after college which will give me some sense of worth. This leads to me feeling extremely stressed about school and I feel worthless when I get bad grades. I joined a sorority and I hate it because I feel so fat compared to other girls and they all brag about how they’ve fucked 7 dudes since coming to college. It makes me sad because even though I don’t want to go out and have sex with a bunch of guys, I still want them to want to have sex with me. It’s weird, I know. I’ve been dealing with this stuff ever since I hit puberty and it has RUINED my life. I want to die because of the way I look. Sometimes, I wish it worked when I previously tried to kill myself because I wouldn’t have to deal with this. If you saw me you’d think I was just a typical college girl having “fun” doing sorority shit but no one actually knows what’s going on.', 'I\\'m getting kicked out of my program.  Hi everyone this is a gentle rant and also a cry for help/advice.\\n\\nI have been at my university majoring in Mechanical Engineering for 3 years now. Prior to that, I was in an early college high school where I was able to attend college in the mornings and high school in the afternoons. On top of that, I was doing a certification in Composite Material Technology at my local trade college. So what I am getting at is I was a badass in high school. I graduated with a Trade School Certification and an Associates degree before I got my high school diploma. I did really well. I have always done really well.\\n\\nFast forward to the Mechanical Engineering program and I have endured a lot of mental health challenges, most are courtesy to my toxic ex. I had failed 2 classes before this last fall semester. In the Fall of 2019, I sought help from the Disability Resource Center at my school after a suicide attempt. Which ended up being no help at all because I still failed the class they gave me an extension on because the pandemic hit and I was on my own to finish the class that I was struggling in even with help!\\n\\nThis last semester, I failed 3 classes. THREE CLASSES. My grandfather passed away so that put me out for a few weeks. My professors gave me extensions but it was still hard to focus after that. Then a month before finals, my eye doctor finally found my blindspot that I went to him for over a year ago. Everyone there told me not to worry when I went in all that time ago, and then they found it, and they were not shy about showing me how concerned they were about it. Aren\\'t doctors supposed to be discreet until they have answers? My doctor really said \"we can finally see your blindspot. You probably have glaucoma, a stroke, or there might be something wrong with your brain.\" So for the next month, all I could think about is that I might have a fucking brain tumor. This obviously caused my performance to fucking tank and I was not getting any sleep. Constantly pulling all-nighters because I was too anxious to fall asleep because I had unfinished work to do, but I was too anxious to do anything about it because I felt that I had bigger things to worry about. It was an endless cycle of worry.\\n\\nThen THE WEEK OF FINALS, I had my followup appointment and he found deteriation of my optic nerve and said \"I am suspecting that it is Multiple Sclerosis. We are going to order an MRI so we can see if you have it.\" My dad was livid with this news and the way he delivered it and immediately got me in with a new doctor at our actual clinic the following day, again, the week of finals. This new doctor agreed with us that this doctor should not have said the things he said the way he said it and tried to calm me down a bit.\\n\\nAnyways, fast forward and I\\'m still figuring things out. I thought I would be fine with school because I was under the impression that I could retake a class 3 times, not that I had a limit of 3 retakes in the pre-professional program. I got an email today saying I need to change my major. I\\'ve been crying all morning and running around trying to gather reasons and proof for my poor performance this last semester. It was hard enough as it was and then I had all these other things stacked on top of it. I submitted an appeal and I am waiting for documentation from my doctors. Now all I can do is wait. I have GI Bill Benefits that my dad passed down to me and if I get kicked out I don\\'t know how I can even go to school at all next semester. I am also double majoring in Physics so I can fall back on that, but none of the classes I can take next are offered in the spring. I have a housing contract I need paid for because I live on campus so if I am not awarded the GI Bill, then I am so screwed.\\n\\nHave any of you been kicked out of your program and appealed it successfully? If they approve my appeal, then the F\\'s will be changed to W\\'s and I will be able to retake them without a problem. If not... my entire life long dream of becoming an engineer is down the drain because I don\\'t even know if I could get into another university with the GPA I have right now. Did I mention that the semester starts in a week? They told me this a week before. I have been out of school for a month now and they decide to inform me now... which in all honesty it was my responsibility to know what they meant about \"3 retakes\" and realize that they would kick me out, but my advisor has never been clear about it and I got my idea of it from fellow ME students who obviously are also confused about that requirement.\\n\\nPlease tell me you all think this is reason enough to get my appeal approved... I like to think that they do this so they can tell if I just gave up on school and am wasting my time, or if I genuinely care and have relevant reasons as to why I have not been doing so hot. I really hope this is enough... I have been questioning my path in engineering and this is all making me realize that I don\\'t know what I would do without it. It has been my passion for so long and I really want this to work out. If it does, this will definitely be my wake-up call, but if it doesn\\'t, I am stuck. I love my school and I love my major and I just really hope it works out):', \"Struggles affecting my life decisions and mental health TLTR: Asian-American college student’s struggle with life decisions and mental health.\\n\\nHello, I’m here to address some things that are currently and have been affecting me as an Asian-American for a long time. I apologize if this is really long for y’all to read, but I got so much to say from my own dang memory and mindset. \\n\\nI grew up in a Vietnamese-American family where the family values are so important, that every family member knows about each other’s business whether they’re part of it or not. They have high religious and cultural values in which they devote so much of their lives into them. On my dad’s side are a family of Catholics, my mom’s side are Buddhist; so faith is very crucial to the family. Many of the older, adult generations in my family had their own stories of immigration to America. My dad (who passed away last year) was the very first to immigrate to the U.S. back in the mid-eighties. He suffered at a young age in being forced to immigrate, but tended to survive to pursue his dreams. My mom immigrated later after meeting my dad for a while. Besides my dad, I rarely ask my older relatives (aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc.) about these issues such as the Vietnam War and immigration since it’ll obviously traumatize them as well as the language barrier I have with my family, especially my grandparents who couldn’t speak English at all. There were very few school assignments in my life where that involved my grandparents to participate, but of the language barrier. I get frustrated when it comes to the language barrier in my life because I’m the person who understands and speaks the least Vietnamese to my family even though I know the culture, but speak very few phrases and a couple of words. Even my cousins and older twin sister know more than me. I always feel ignorant and guilty when I struggle with that. I grew up and am still in the middle class even if my family could afford going on a few luxurious trips to places like Cancun, Mexico. Because of my dad’s death, (he was the breadwinner) my family and I are quite cautious in our finances since we’re in a lower income status. So that’s the backup and now I’ll tell y’all my main problems\\n\\nDuring my childhood, I was not like most Asian-American children and I’m still not to this day. I was born with a speech delay in which I was unable to speak from my mouth nor have the mindset to know how to socialize. My parents have to speak more English to me instead of their Vietnamese mother tongue in order to not cause confusion in speaking. They still speak their mother tongue and express the Vietnamese culture to me. As I grew up as a kid, my academic progress in school was poor such as getting bad grades, I didn’t fit in much because I was an introvert, I was picked on for being who I am, and scapegoated for making simple mistakes. Due to these problems, I would sometimes react by being angry, cry, stay silent, talk or fight back to gain strength, or fake my feelings by smiling. At home, my parents were the typical strict Asian parents even if they have a little bit of leniency in them. They wanted me to have good grades in school and succeed. My mom chose most of my outfits and required me to wear them. My dad had me do chores around the house. They were very demanding through the most simple tasks like house chores or calling them after arriving home from school. If you didn’t do a task especially calling them, they would get easily concerned, especially my mom since she would have a temper towards me. Throughout my life, my parents compare me to other Viet-American kids they know who meet those standards of high intelligence, discipline, respect, silence, obedience, and adaptation to Vietnamese culture (basically the model minority myth which I don’t associate with at all). \\n\\nAs I grew older after those dark elementary school days, I started to get emotional in high school, crying so many tears when something happened. The smallest mistakes ruin my days and make my mental health so low. Now, I’m in college, the problems have gotten worse. During my years of community college, I wanted to major in photography since I loved the concept of art and business in a way that I could make a decent living, and do what I love. That changed when my dad and mom did not accept my choice and that I had to change to a general major because I didn't know any other majors that would fit me. The general major helped me, but many colleges rushed me to choose a major. I’ve been stressed out in taking classes that will fit my requirements for graduation taking me 3 years to receive my associate’s. Next semester, I am transferring to a university where I’m choosing marketing as my major…for now (I’m still undecided).\\n\\nThroughout my current life including the pandemic life; my mental health has been really low in which I’m having counseling meetings, doctor visits, and journaling because I need so much mental support because of what I go through as an Asian-American. The only problem is that because of cultural value, they cannot relate to what I go through. My mom has been pushing my sister and I more to higher success without doing our own ways such as dropping out since my dad’s passing. During the year 2019, I almost committed self harm in cutting my left wrist. I forgot what I was specifically thinking, but I was really overwhelmed and suicidal during that time. I still am to this day. It’s hard to explain to my mom how I am feeling about my college life due to the language barrier, my rocky relationship with her, and she didn’t attend college herself. Many of the adult women of my family did not attend college and I wanted the bachelor’s to break the legacy. My cousin got hers, why can’t I? At the same time, I don’t know if I could handle the work routine at the University. I’m also unemployed, so I couldn’t find a job that I’m interested in working. I never have time to take a real break from the academic hustle-culture.\\n\\nRecently, I’ve been emotionally bitter, cynical, angry, irritated, and depressed amongst the Vietnamese adults (aunts and uncles) of my family to the point where I could disrespect them which I don’t want to do. I currently don’t like my huge family compared to the past memories I have with them. So I avoid attending too many of their gatherings. I’ve been so negatively impacted with everything in my life unable to gain any positivity. There are still good moments, but they don’t last long for me. I can only relate to the cousins within my generation. They can relate to my sister and I too even though they have backup plans with positive attitudes. I tried to show positivity and not make a scene at family occasions; but they were not working. It’s also worse because of my college crisis and dealing with the loss of my dad. I loved my dad, even if he is still that Asian parent who wants their child to reach a level of success he never had. He was patient, logical, intelligent, and never cried because he loved to have a great time. My Asian mom is hard-working and beautiful; but has a sense of temper and emotion when it comes to these hard times. Recently, she doesn’t really know how to do the important tasks like filling out business forms because my dad would do everything in the household. My sister and I had to help her even though we’re still young because we’re more educated. \\n\\nAll I want from everyone who will see this is to give simple advice and help me get through my life in a different way. I need a way to help me gain the happiness I want without regretting the choices I made. Thank you for reading this and please share your thoughts and tips for me.\", 'Advisor screwed up and I have to take an extra semester, been feeling super depressed about it *edit to say that I don’t blame my advisor, she’s a wonderful woman, and I acknowledge that I also made a mistake, so please for the love of god stop reminding me*\\n\\nI started college in 2017. I’ve been working to support myself throughout this time and as a result am still in college 6 years later. It’s been rough, so I was looking forward to finally graduating this fall. \\n\\nA few months ago, while messing around on my student account looking for something unrelated, I found that I was short of the 120 units that are required to graduate. My heart sank when I saw this. \\n\\nI made a degree completion plan years ago with the assumption that all the required courses and core classes would fulfill the 120 units needed to qualify for graduation. Apparently, it doesn’t, and I’m 11 credits short. So while I could technically finish my degree this fall, I won’t have enough credits to graduate. This means I need to pick 4 random classes just so I can graduate. (I’d also like to add that this degree completion plan was approved by multiple faculty members…..)\\n\\nI found all this out months ago and no matter how hard I try I can’t get over it. I’ve been trying to ignore it as best as I can, but whenever my mind isn’t occupied I get extremely depressed thinking about it. This has screwed up *so* many things that I was planning for post-graduation not to mention will leave me even further in debt than I already am. I know there’s worse things in the world, but I’ve been completely devastated over this and don’t know what to do to feel better. Knowing that there is absolutely nothing I can do is making me feel so hopeless', 'depression in college: nothing new To summarize I feel shitty today.

I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels. I am dreading telling her that I have even more work to do. I have to go back and study the class notes from all of my classes that I have taken during graduate school, Which is about 8 classes. Since I have been out of school for so long I need to refresh my memory.. I'm worried that my mom might kick me out when she finds out that it is going to take me longer to graduate. I don't blame her. I've been in school for eight years! She is getting tired of me. I should have studied harder. And my credit card debt is stressing me out. And my sister is getting mad at me because of all the reasons my mother is. She's tired of me living off of my mom and not talking responsibility for my life. She’s ever suggesting that I cut my hours at work to pay down my credit card debt, which is not something I can afford to do since I have so many bills. I just wanted to talk about why I am depressed. I’m tired of being alive. It feels like there is nothing to look forward too.\", \"Is college supposed to be this stressful and depressing?

I'm a 20 year old college student about to start my junior year majoring in biology and it just feels so difficult. I began in 2020 so everything was online and that was so lonely. I moved into an apartment sophomore year and I thought things would be better and they were, but I don't get along with my roommates as well as I'd like to and I can't help but compare them to my friends from high school who I'm super close with. Plus my school is a 5 hour drive away from my hometown and I don't have a car here, so it's not like I can just go home whenever I want.\\n\\nEvery time I have to move back to school I have extreme anxiety for the few days before hand and the first few days after moving back in. I eventually get used to it but it's still so hard. Over the summer I was happy being home with my family and friends and now I've been crying for 3 days straight since moving back. I just feel stuck. I'm considering transferring but I don't want to leave behind the people I know here, I would feel bad. But I don't necessarily want to start over somewhere new because my fear is that it'll be worse. I like my campus and there are some good people I've met but I really don't think that the positives outweigh the negatives. School starts tomorrow and I'm honestly dreading it because I know it'll be difficult for me to feel motivated and to focus. People say this is supposed to be the best time of your life but I just can't wait to graduate, although I doubt that'll be much better since I'll just have to start a job then. I don't really feel excited about anything at this point in my life. I wish so badly that it was different. Does anyone else feel this way? I need some advice.\", 'Developing depression right now. What should I do? Hi,\\n\\nI’m currently doing all my classes online from a state school for affordability circumstances. I was planning to live on campus, but it wasn’t in my alley right now. I’m majoring in computer information systems. I like technology, and I want to find a stable job in the field that pays well. I have transferred with CC credits, have a good GPA (3.8), and I didn’t take out any loans for my school.\\n\\nBut, lately I have been developing mild depression. Right now I find It hard to motivate myself lately. I’m not failing any classes right now, currently staying strong. But a lot has happened the past month. My sister lost her baby on the day it was born, we had a family gathering for the funeral, and I can’t help but feel bad for what happened. Long story short, it was hard for me to focus. I was able to work ahead prior to that, and even now, it was manageable.\\n\\nI don’t know what’s been making me depressed. Maybe it’s because I’m doing classes online and have no human interaction. Am I not happy with I’m studying (one of my classes is weed out using the mindtap cengage homework, which I loathe so I have to look up the answers, and I don’t think the prof cares anyways since he was unavailable for half the semester due to back injury.)? Did I made the right choice to come back this year in school?\\n\\nBefore this semester I took time off due to the pandemic, I was working when I wasn’t taking any classes. I currently work at Walmart part time, but I’m also not happy with my job either. Lost equipment or broken stuff makes it hard for me to do my job. Which is why I’m applying to other places right now.\\n\\nDid I do something wrong?', 'No one talks about the lonely and depressing side of community college People just talk about how much you are saving money and how you have more time to think about you want to do and while that can all be true, that’s not the case for a lot of people. I’m in debt at my community college (less than if I were to be at a university ofc) and my mental health has been the worse it’s ever been. I also live in a very toxic household and would have much rather be in debt but moved out and happy. Also the emotional toll it takes on you when you are unable to make friends as well as seeing people you know transfer to a four year and have the complete opposite experience is something else. I wish I explored my options more in high school and applied to universities. As someone who’s dream goal was to go out of state for college, I’ve now ruined my chances as it is very unlikely for me to be accepted out of state as a cc student. As well as this, I was told by my counselor that some of my credits may not transfer to the state university due to my major.

My college experience so far \\n\\n(I apologize if the following seems incoherent or is hard to read. This is more of a dump of emotion and feelings then a contextual story)\\n\\nI am a freshman in college on my 2nd semester. I am so lonely and isolated, I have no friends to go to, no support system at home, and my depression has become over bearing\\n\\n Last year went all right though, I had gotten along with my room mates, made a few friends outside of class, and even had a girlfriend. but NONE of them decided to keep in contact over summer or respond to my texts asking to hang out.\\n\\nI spend most of the time in my room now. I sleep for probably 12-18 hours a day depending on if I have class or not. I am terrified of going to eat in the cafeteria or the dining area at my dorm and usually order in or don't eat at all. My social anxiety and insecurities have multiplied by ten fold to the point where I can barely function outside of class. \\n\\nI have always had some social anxiety but not like this. Its choking. Hell, even seeing people happy together can send me in a depressive spiral. Everyone that I thought was my friend just fucking abandoned me. All the attempts at having some semblance of a friend or someone to talk too have completely failed. I don't know if its because I suck at putting myself out there or its because I'm so undesirable that people would rather act like I don't exist. \\n\\nI have given up atp. My birthday is coming up and I will be alone for it... I have contemplated drinking myself till I wont wake up or something just as awful.  I genuinely don't know what to do. I wont fit in with a frat, the club selection is a total joke, I'm not motivated to go to the gym or eat, I have no friends to reach out to... its so fucking miserable. This is the first time that I have truly felt loneliness and isolation.\\n\\nHas anyone felt like this before while at college? How did you pull yourself out? I am genuinely so exhausted and any advice will be greatly appreciated. T\", \"College and depression rant Sorry guys I just need the space to rant. I probably won't be reading the comments. Idk if I can take someone being an asshole to me on here today. CW: depression and suicidal thoughts.\\n\\nI've never considered killing myself more than in college. The constant pressure and feeling of being evaluated just gets to me. I'm so tired of it. The sheer amount of people and work too. So often I feel like I'm not strong enough to live in this world. Sometimes I think about if I were to kill myself, would my professors remember me? Would they care? \\n\\nLast semester I had an oral final with my ethics professor. I started talking to her about the idea of the 'good life' in different figures. I choked up thinking about Plato's Phaedo and how he says every pain or pleasure rivets the body to the soul. One of the reasons I love the Phaedo is because whenever I read that it soothes my anxiety and depression for a moment. I wish I could place myself above the pains that I feel but I'm so weak. I try so hard but I constantly fail. I am so embarrassed but I can't say these things to anyone else.\\n\\nOkay that is enough word vomit.

If you read this and want to leave an asshole comment, then fuck off.\", \"I'm lonely, depressed, and somewhat regretting my college decision It's currently 6:30 AM rn and I am so tired of this.\\n\\nI'm a current freshman. The school I'm going to is a T30 and great for my major. The person over our 'honors program' (of some sorts) is super nice and lets me ask her questions about the degree I want. It's a nice campus and is great on paper...but maybe that's the issue.\\n\\nWhen I applied to college, I mainly applied to state schools and some small liberal arts colleges (plus ivies/ivy equivalents). I wanted to get out of my city, meet new people from other places and around the world, have intellectual conversations, and have awesome opportunities. The high school I went to was like this, and I hung out with a lot of other nerdy kids. I got rejected from all the ivies I applied to (waitlisted from Harvard), but got into one of the Honors programs at the college I'm attending. I was super excited at first. Now I haven't been this depressed since middle school.\\n\\nThe Honors program I'm in lets me ditch the prereqs for my courses. Because I didn't get any money from scholarships (one full ride one I could've gotten I was never nominated for), I'm double majoring in the hopes of getting this one DoD scholarship. I'm taking a heavy course load of STEM classes and it's hell. No one has study groups for these things. The classes are insanely hard and the reading is dense. On top of that, I didn't get into the 'ultra' science scholar program. I get I shouldn't be feeling sad about it, but I've done a program at a T20 university with a lab internship, as well as getting really good grades in my science courses in high school. I literally don't know what more I could have done.\\n\\nThis has caused me to have little to no social life. I'm a fairly introverted and quiet person. I tend to feel and think deeply about things. I can do parties, but I'm more of a hangout person. It seems that, besides hanging out with friends, it's just partying. I can't go anywhere else because I don't have a car and the bus system won't go that far. Plus, friends' schedules and mine barely align. Our college is also in the middle of nowhere. Nearest major city is two hours away. I totally can feel the bubble on campus, and I hate it.\\n\\nLastly, there isn't a lot of diversity here. I'm mixed and from the South. In school, it was common to see people self-segregate a lot, mainly by both class and race. I knew going into a state school I wasn't likely to get the international student population that I was hoping for, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. Almost everyone here is white, and those who aren't tend to stick to their own groups. I'm the black friend in my friend group (though honestly it's more like my roommate's friend group). I've joined a mixed race club and BSA, but I don't want to just connect with people there. I'm so used to having friends of different cultures, and it's off-putting to not have that now.\\n\\nI see all of my friends having the time of their lives in college so far. Most of them got into their dream schools. I know there's probably more that they're not showing, but I feel so alone right now. I like this school, but I don't know what else I can do. Everyone's been telling me that it gets better, but I'm coming up on month two feeling like this. It's affecting my work too. I'm too chicken to go to therapy on campus because I know it's a me problem, but I'm tired of crying in my room and having a terrible sleep schedule for trying to make up work. Any suggestions would be great.\\n\\nTL;DR I got into a really good school but it's not what I thought it would be socially and I'm depressed.\", \"College depression Hi Everyone!

But all of these posts tell a story thats completely different, and about trouble fitting in homesickness. i literally haven’t thought of home since i’ve gotten here, and ive had a decent time finding people by just doing stuff. And to everyone worried about balancing fun, parties and clubs with academics, college is literally the place for the prior. Most employers will look at club investment or if you had any leadership roles in a fraternity or sorority. gpas are bs nowadays unless you’re going for a masters or something. get involved at parties, clubs, and social functions. don’t be that person who sits in their room getting straight A’s while you’re friends are out doing fun stuff. you will regret it. rant over.', \"Still bitter and depressed but won't quit TL:DR: High-performing high school student. Got rejected by almost every school. Fell into a depression that killed the chances of a transfer. Still bitter and upset at the derailing of my life plan. Hopefully will finally get back on track by getting into grad school. Sorry for being a douchey downer. \\n\\nHello all.\\n\\nI don't really have a good reason for posting about this and I'm sure it'll come off as a pity party (I suppose it actually is one) but I'm feeling sad again and don't have anything to take my mind off it. All my life I'd been told I'd get into any school I wanted, that I was a genius, how jealous people were that I could skate by classes. I really thought I'd get into a great school and be put on the path towards the only job I've ever wanted in my entire life: POTUS.\\n\\nI'm a first-gen American and college student so I didn't really know anything about the process. I took my first LSAT in June of my junior year, panic took the subject tests which I bombed (probably part of why I did poorly) and took an ACT in November of my senior year. I ended up doing well on the SAT and ACT, with a 1490 and 34. I had a good GPA, not great: 3.7. I had good extracurriculars, including a focus in the arts. I passed 10 AP tests, including a self-study. At worst, I thought I'd get into a T25 undergrad.\\n\\nLooking back on it, when I was applying for schools I was grossly misinformed because of my background. I didn't even realize majoring in Business was popular. I thought because MBAs exist, everyone just went to Business school instead. I ended up picking a major at random because I was good at Math and it seemed interesting. That ended up being a huge mistake as it turns out, I despised the culture of the students. I only really knew about the schools that I'd read about or heard of from books and movies, like Harvard or Stanford.\\n\\nI remember that my parents actually paid for a meeting with an admissions guide who told me I wouldn't get in where I wanted. I thought he was such a pompous asshole but he turned out to be the Oracle of Delphi in disguise.\\n\\nI applied to 11 schools, including many where I was over the 75% percentile of their GPA and SAT/ACT. As people's acceptances started rolling through, I saw more and more of my peers get into their dream schools. Not to be an asshole, but some of them I'd shared classrooms with and was a little surprised to hear of their outcomes. Nonetheless, I patiently waited, expecting to be put on the path toward my dreams. Then something I never would have expected in a million years happened.\\n\\nI got rejected by almost every single school I applied to. I can still feel the shame and pain reading the emails brought me. Sometimes I still tear up when I think about it or hear about other people getting into awesome schools. I was left with the choice of a mediocre (putting it nicely) commuter state school and a bad large public school (without a lot of money). I only got waitlisted by one school, one where before all of this happened I thought I'd never have to even consider. I didn't even get off of their list.\\n\\nI cried. I cried a lot. I got severely depressed to the point that, for the first time in my life, I just gave up. I stopped turning in schoolwork and stopped doing anything productive. I nearly flunked my senior year because of it (shoutout to some amazing teachers who let me turn in work late).\\n\\nI started to suffer from passive suicidal ideation as I realized that my dreams were essentially dead. There's a saying that an athlete dies twice: once when they can no longer play their sport and a second when they actually pass. It feels like I died when that last rejection came. I'm a husk of that person. I can't even imagine what my younger self would have said if he'd seen what we'd end up as. He'd be so fucking upset and it breaks my heart to think of how pathetic I look.\\n\\nI'm sure I can guess what some of you are asking: why would you panic? Why not just transfer. Because of my AP credits, I started with nearly 53 units. I thought this meant I wasn't allowed to transfer which then caused me to torpedo my entire first year of my college. By the time I found out that I could transfer, the damage was done. I had <3.0 GPA for the first time in my life. There was no way that I'd be able to get into a good school.\", 'Full time classes and depression Basically the title. I’ve been stressed out the last few weeks trying to decide if I wanted to do part time classes and get a job, (I thought getting out and doing something, literally being forced to have a schedule might make me feel better) or do full time online classes and literally never leave my room. I found out today that decision is already made for me—I emailed the financial aid office and I can’t get my scholarship back (dropped out for a year bc I tried this already—got too depressed to do my online homework) unless I go full time. Same thing again I guess bc I’m too scared to see my psych. \\n\\nSo basically I have to do full time online classes when I’ve been feeling my most depressed ever. I don’t know how to get out of this hole and pretend to be fully functioning when I see no point in anything lately (I’ll admit to a lot of self-neglect too I guess).

Just thinking about my parents make me cry (even now); just this day, mom called and wow that breakdown happened real quick (idk what it says bout me but I tried my best to hide it, it worked though).

How did you deal with it? I read that exercising could help, but I've always been self-conscious and I'm not sure any friends would go with.

I wanted some advice from anyone else who has taken a break from college - heck, anyone willing to offer advice.\\n\\nSo around this time last year I became violently ill and began going to the doctor twice a week. I could barely attend class and wrote a lot of sick tests. I didn't do my final practical examination, meaning that even though I had passed my theory modules I couldn't continue into the majority of the speech-language theory modules. So I was forced to retake my practical module despite completing 60 required hours of giving therapy to kids and receiving 80% for the module (the dean wouldn't let me write a sick test for the practical)\\n\\nThat means I had two subjects for half a year.

I laughed from the heart for the first time in about a month. But when I get home, I'm depressed again. I promised myself to spend my off time reading, freshening up on my anatomy studies, doing things I'd never done before like puzzle building and going to places I never have before.

To be honest, I've never really liked my college. I came in wanting to transfer (which was already a huge mistake) but ended up not applying to transfer during my freshman year of college. I had a rough first year. I struggled to make friends my first semester and never really felt happy. I also had a horrendous roommate who ruined the first semester. During the second semester of my first year, I did have some friends but I was also sent to a psych ward which is very traumatic. I  decided to stay for another year as I had friends and leadership positions lined up for the following year. \\n\\nMy second year at first started out okay, but within the first month, I lost basically all my friends and became extremely depressed. I thought about leaving right after the Fall of 2022 but ultimately decided to stay since I didn't want there to be some weird gap in my transcripts/academic history. I applied to transfer out my second year but didn't get in anywhere I wanted to go. I was extremely depressed in my second year and attempted to unsubscribe from life. However, toward the end of the second semester of my sophomore year, I did end get into a loving relationship which I'm still in.\\n\\nI feel like all the college experiences I wanted such as making lifelong relationships, partying, hooking up, etc. never happened to me since my first two years were robbed by depression and mental health issues. I definitely made an awful mistake by committing to a college right out of high school I knew I wasn't sure about. I feel like I ended up giving college a fair chance but still, I'm unhappy.

I never developed proper social skills or skills that would allow me to succeed later on.

And my position at the media college was especially granted because I was so late into the term.\\n\\nAnd so, back to the game college I went…\\n\\nMy first day was amazing, we spent the entire morning playing retro games and analysing them, and we did games art in the afternoon.

It was a bad paper, I half-assed it, and it failed to meet several requirements, but I thought it was at least worth partial credit, though my professor didn't think so. For the second paper, also worth 10%, I had family visiting, and I wanted to spend time with them rather than write another shitty paper for yet another 0 grade, so I skipped it. \\n\\nIn the other, we have only two exams, and we haven't received the grade for the first one yet, but I'm not confident that I did well on it at all. My final class is a capstone class, and the professor grades easy, so I'm not concerned about that one at all. \\n\\nAssuming I passed all four of these classes, I would have two left to complete my degree, but it's starting to look like I'm going to drop/fail at least two of these classes.

I had a conference with my English professor today. I was pretty proud of the work that I put into my draft - still very early stages, but I thought what I’d written was solid.

I asked for her thoughts on the direction of the essay, and she looked confused, saying “I can’t give my thoughts if there’s no analysis.” That crushed me. I thought I was doing so well, that she would critique minor details. Instead, she told me she couldn’t even evaluate me since I had no direction.\\n\\nI cried for awhile after that. I know that it isn’t a big deal. She really wasn’t that harsh, and I’m very fortunate in life. I’m just sensitive.

I also struggle with Imposter Syndrome A LOT. I hear that’s pretty common for college students, especially in a field like CS.

This past year, during sophomore year, I developed moderate depressive disorder, and it kinda just totally messed up my thoughts and outlook on all my friends. I started to binge eat really bad, I was crying all the time towards the end of the year, and I just stopped going to class etc and ended up leaving school early. I think I just really got into my own head that nobody cares about me or likes me, and I wasn’t able to get that idea out. I think I am someone who needs a lot of reassurance and bc of that, I think I’ve just been such an annoying heavy burden in my friends, and now they are done with me. This is kind of what has happened. \\n\\nSo around April, when I started to really go downhill, I ended up (I know this was wrong I was just so desperate for love) getting a little bunny. I brought him back to school with me and I kept him in my bedroom and kept his area really clean and stuff and for the most part he stayed in there (he’s also fully potty trained) and my roommates didn’t really have to see him. All of my roommates would pet him and stuff but I guess they maybe saw him as a rodent because none of them have ever had a bunny before (even though bunnies aren’t rodents!) \\n\\nFast forward to now, and we ended up getting like this little apartment on campus for the upcoming year (it’s junior housing, mostly all juniors live here). Even though it’s junior housing and it’s supposed to be nicer, we have two bedrooms for five girls! Meaning, one set of girls gets a double and one set of girls gets a triple. Now, I was to be very clear that I have absolutely NO PROBLEM with being in a triple. Just to quickly backtrack, in freshman year, I was in a double with one of the girls, and we always stayed together after that. The other three girls were in a triple together in freshman year. Okay, so now that that is out of the way, two of the girls who were in that triple definitely want to stay in the same room together. But then those two girls don’t want to be in a triple since they already were in a triple in freshman year. Which leaves the last girl that was in the triple to (expectantly, although nothing has been talked about) live with my roommate and I. But here’s my worry. I am really scared about having a relapse in my binging symptoms and my depression is still pretty bad despite medication and therapy. I was trying to do everything I could do make coming back to school easy for me and make sure everything is safe so that I don’t get triggered in any way. (I know this is so pathetic) my worry is that the two girls I would be rooming with both have boyfriends, and they’re both sexually actively like ALL THE TIME. And I’m sooo scared to be kicked out of my room to being in the kitchen (I have like extreme temptation when in the kitchen), or just not having a place to escape to if my depression is really bad that day. So, in my head, I thought I could ask the other two girls (who don’t have boyfriends) if I could live with them. They said no, because first they don’t want to be in a triple, second, they think that would be unfair to their freshman year third roommate (like kicking her out in the first place is fair??), and third, my roommate would be offended. Okay, so that was that. I accepted it. But I think perhaps asking the one girl really had upset her, because then she decided that I just wasn’t okay with sharing my space (which is not true! And I told her that but idk) so she would end up taking their freshman year third roommate (which she didn’t want to do) so that made her hate me first. \\n\\nThen, just to backtrack, in October of sophomore year we all had to get a senior house together off campus and put a lease down in October, but after my dad questioned the legality of the living situation (2 bedroom house again for 5 ppl) the realtor admitted that it wasn’t legal, and then she threatened to give the house away, therefore pissing off the other parents, where they then proceeded to call my dad screaming and cursing at him and telling him that I’m off the fucking lease and just absolutely verbally assaulted him. So that was that. AND after all that, the parents and girls all assumed I’d still live there illegally?? But my dad refused to allow that. \\n\\nFast forward to now, one of the girls randomly text me and ask me if I’m for certain living with them senior year (also, they’re all going abroad second semester of junior year, and I am staying on campus) and I told them, no, I’m not certain about senior year. The girl then proceeded to be furious at me saying I’m so unfair, and to tell the other girls immediately becsuse that is ridiculous and me not living there will raise their rent to 4,000 dollars more for each person (even though my dad told them I wouldn’t live there unless the town approved a 5 person lease) \\n\\nDuring all this chaos, I was approved by the school to bring my bunny as an ESA (emotional support animal). I asked the girls if they’d be okay with him being with us, and the one just goes “that is not something I’d want” - this happened after the senior housing situation so I thought maybe she was just mad at me for that and being spiteful. \\n\\nI have been heavily debating if I should go back to school or not. But after all this, I decided that this was my tell tale sign to not come back. I told all of the girls I wouldn’t be coming back. However, the girl ended up apologizing to me and saying she can’t imagine me not being there and I’ll beat my depression, etc.. Keep in mind, she’s the one telling me I can’t have my bunny in the same house as her. So one day I told one of the other girls I thought I’d try to come back (the one where I asked if I could live with her instead of the other two girls) and she just goes “sounds good, whatever you think is best!” Which to me sounded like damn, she really doesn’t want me back. I then asked her if she thought I’d be able to convince the other girl about having my bunny and she just said “I don’t think so”. I then told her (this is what  the school told me) that if the one girl wasn’t okay with my bunny, they’d remove her and not me.  they wouldn’t place me in a single (which i think is what she wanted) she then told me that that’s unfair and we can’t prioritize a bunny over one of our roommates. I told her I know and I wouldn’t let that happen. Then I told her I’d write a long message to the girl and see what she says. I also said that if the girl wasn’t okay with my bunny, I wouldn’t come back (since he’s really important for me, and I’d never let the other girl get kicked out) She just has completely ignored me since then. I have upset all my friends with my emotional burdens. \\n\\nI just had to get that off my chest. I feel so alone and empty. I annoy everyone with my existence and constant need for reassurance. I think I need to withdraw from this school and maybe just stay home and commute somewhere else. Social life is so freaking hard for me. \\n\\nWould love if anyone had some advice, but I understand if you also think I’m an extremely annoying fuck.

I had already been depressed and lonely for a while, but these were the years when it got much worse.\\n\\nIn college, I became even more depressed. I took a big mistake by taking a notoriously difficult major (electrical engineering). It became much more difficult to make friends, both because I had little time and I’m too socially awkward.

My senior year of HS was the best friggin year of my life, I had a girlfriend, was captain of the swim team, part of a great friend group and academic club, and most of all felt part of a really strong community with everyone else.  I felt like I was on top of the world, and I was loving life.  \\n\\nFast forward a summer and I'm an engineering major at a community college now.  No girlfriend, no swim team, no academic club, and worst of all zero sense of community.  Luckily, many of my friends go to the same community college so I'm not alone but besides that I feel cut off from everything.  My classes are fine but it's just pure notes and learning, nothing of substance, no jokes or anything to indicate anyone is human in the whole class, just hollow silence.  Hardly anyone talks to eachother, professors just sound like robots, nothing interesting is happening on campus, it's just so empty feeling. This is a complete shift from how my highschool life was where something was always happening and you knew everyone on campus like family, and I know that's typical of college but that doesn't stop it from affecting me.\\n\\nTo add salt to the wound, all of my former classmates who went to 4 years have begun posting their dorms living with eachother and the fun events they're going to and lots of cool stuff like that while I'm still home just mindlessly grinding through college on my own.  Nowadays I go to school for a few hours and go home, do homework, then be bored and play videogames until I go to sleep.  Rinse and repeat the next day and the next day, I've even become bored of videogames and just don't feel fulfilled by much anymore.  Everyday I yearn to go back to my senior year and feel that feeling of being so involved again.\\n\\nI signed up for the college's gym so that I'll have something else to do after school but I doubt it'll do much.  I would join a club but the clubs here are all academically focused and are meant for different educationally disadvantaged demographics, none of which I am a part of.

So I really don't like to be alone, but I can't control whether my peers want to spend time with me, other people do. \\n\\nI realize people are busy and don't have time to spend on me, but it hurts because I can see in front of my face that they'll happily spend that time with people they like more.

I'm realizing now I made the super big mistake of taking all online classes when I'm someone who is definitely on the more extroverted side. On top of that all of my close friends have either moved on to their four years or go to another CC. So I talk to them a couple times a week on discord or in our group chat, and have seen them a handful of times in person since they moved out but other than that I sit at home and pretty much interact with no one. At first it seemed fun to me because it was like an extra summer for like a month but to have two years of this would actually drive me crazy.\\n\\nAnd the reason I'm going to CC isn't because of saving money since coming from money I was told from a young age that I would never have to worry about student loans ever. It's more because ever since I was in school the teachers would say he's smart but doesn't apply himself. So I feel like a total loser talking to my friends going to Santa Clara or Berkeley because they didn't even put in that much effort and went to a good school, when my 2.9 GPA pretty much got me declined from the start at every UC I applied to, and most of the CSUs too. It almost bothers me how much I couldn't be bothered to give a damn about anything.\\n\\nIn community college I have had a change in my mindset, and have started to finish all assignments even weeks before they're due, and have straight A's in all of them for now but I don't really feel fulfilled by that. The work for a whole week takes max two hours for me and I am just sitting there the rest of the time doing absolutely nothing. So I decided let me get a job, save some money while I have all this free time, and maybe get some human interaction, so I got a job at Starbucks, which I quit in a week because I hated the stressful environment and didn't like the people. I didn't let that bother me and got another job which I got fired from in a week for messing up some of the orders. Going through two jobs in that short span of time really messed me up like it's kind of rocking my confidence in myself.\\n\\nAll of this at the same time (being lonely, feeling unfulfilled, and not being able hold a job) is really starting to make me feel depressed. My outlook on life has gotten pretty dark, I can't sleep, I can barely eat, and have lost motivation for almost everything, even working out which has pretty much been the only thing I could consistently stick to for the last 8 months. I feel like a total loser that can't get anything right. I'm starting to feel like I'm hitting rock bottom, and I just kind of sit in bed wondering how I'm going to get through these two years before I transfer.\", 'Why does my family still view me as the same person I was 2 years ago? \\nI am F20 in college. Growing up with autism and severe separation anxiety, I took a lot of extra care. I’m the oldest sibling but in everything except for age I am the younger one.

I’m very mature, I have a great support system with my friends, and I prefer to be at college which I never would have thought growing up. \\n\\n\\nBut every time I come home, it’s so frustrating.

They constantly joke about how I don’t do anything and how lazy I am despite this being totally untrue. I’ve even asked my friends and they don’t feel I’m lazy in the slightest. I am laid back and down to earth, but not lazy. My sister also think I crave attention, which I think is just due to her not really understanding my meltdowns. She told me that me being su*cidal is a ploy to get people to pay attention to me and I felt myself get so angry. \\n\\n\\nIt’s just frustrating. I was going to stay home for summer break with my family because I missed them, but if all I am going to get is constant criticisms on how I behave or what I do and that I’m still being treated like a depressed teenager, I honestly am considering just staying on campus.

We do literally all of our work out of the Pearson online book, including tests and quizzes. The professor does not grade anything, design any lessons, or check any work *at all*. She's nice and everything, but completely unnecessary. I have never interacted with her and I imagine that she's just kind of sitting back and watching the grades roll in. It's a sweet gig for her, but a scam for paying students. The book itself with the online work costs $75.\\n\\nI don't understand what I'm paying for, or why this class even needs a professor. I am extremely frustrated with these kinds of classes - taught entirely out of pre-made lessons with absolutely no outside work or interaction with the professor whatsoever. I don't understand why this is becoming so common or how these colleges can continue to grift students like this.

It's depressing and irritating but impossible to escape in many gen-eds.\\n\\nI just had to get this off my chest as I'm struggling to see the immediate value in my education. \", 'Anxiety- “Everybody does it” perception is a lie College is a challenging experience; I first didn’t know about this when applying. While I was uncertain about the life I was embarking on, I could not deal with the immense academic responsibilities coupled with part-time work and dealing with new social groups.\\n\\nWhile we deal with problems differently, I developed anxiety (which truly manifested during my second semester- I didn’t take tests/assignments on time for fear that all wouldn’t go well, had bad studying habits and eventually, I was too scared to study at all, leading to failure). Initially, I thought this was a feeling I could fight, but it was far from that. Anxiety disrupted my life, especially when undertaking class assignments/tests. With this affliction (which I am glad didn’t lead me to be depressed), I was unable to undertake my class activities successfully. \\n\\nLike we are always told, “there’s nothing to be afraid of”, which I believed then; this was not the case. Anxiety in college is common, but few are willing to discuss this issue openly. For me, at least, I could avert anticipatory anxiety for my class activities with the help of a tutor, a service I offer to peers currently, to avoid its crippling effect. \\n\\nAnxiety can be harmful, especially because many people perceive it as a minor issue, which negates its effects on students. As a result, many students become disoriented and lose their sense of self (underpinned by their neglect of class activities/giving up entirely on college and their social life). It just happens that I managed to traverse my way through college. My challenges, however, made me more aware of this issue, given the demanding and challenging nature of college life, and I was no longer fixated on the idea that “there’s nothing to be afraid of.” Anxiety is a serious issue which ramps up when dealing with the challenges in college and thus should be discussed more to move away from the lie that “everybody does it.”', nan, 'What should I do to change my major?

Why? Because when I was in high school, all I was ever told was that art will never make you money. You’ll be broke and unhappy and need to work at McDonalds just to get by with a degree that won’t pay the bills. Your better off if you choose a major that will make a 6 figure salary. \\n\\nSo I did. I was hoping to use my Neuroscience degree to go to med school and study to be a psychiatrist, because I love the studying the human psyche. It’s just so incredibly interesting, so I figured hell why not? It’ll make me 100k or more and I’ll be doing something cool. But then I started on this pre-med track and almost killed myself. I slaved away for an entire year only to get to my spring semester and wonder if I should just drop out. I was completely unhappy, and taking a bunch of class just so that I could be qualified enough to pass the MCAT. Yet if you asked me if I even remember what I studied the answer would be “NO”. I had migraines for the first time ever, I had ludicrous back pain from all the expectations I placed on myself, and I’ve never cried more in one year than I have in my whole life. So I remembered my life goals and realized that “hey all I want to do own my cafe one day, what am I doing Neuroscience even for?” And then I changed my major.\\n\\nBut I then figured changing it to Finance and International Business would get me the foot in the door to owning my cafe and making me 100k plus as a bonus. So I started on this business track as a double major and you know what happened? I was incredibly unhappy again. At this point in my life, death truly was a plausible option. I figured if life was so hard, why not just die? Wouldn’t that be easier? Life isn’t that awesome that I need to live, I couldn’t give a damn frankly. I just couldn’t figure out what was going wrong.\\n\\nWhat’s ironic was that this whole time I was doing art, drawing like a madman. It was the only escape I had from the endless slew of classes that I hated. I was attempting to draw my own manga, because I love creating stories and have before. And like before, I thought “hey, why are you even a business major? You don’t need a business degree to own a business” and I was fucking furious with myself. I went on Reddit and found people disproving my expectation of art not being a plausible degree option. I found people saying you don’t even need a 6 figure salary to live comfortably. SO WHAT THE HELL WAS I DOING?\\n\\nYet before I knew it, a year and half had passed and I had learned so much to amount to so little. Now I’m struggling with financial aid since I’ve failed another class, and I’ve had to be reinstated. My graduation date is 2 extra years out from when I was supposed to graduate. And I sit back and wonder “what if I started with art to begin with?” Would my life be so full of exhausting reminders of my mistakes? \\n\\nI decided to go into a more creative field, and no, not a fine art degree. Due to the fact that I don’t want to fully major in art, as despite living drawing and creating, I don’t do it often enough to want to make a degree out of it. I feel as though if I did that, I’d come to hate doing art. Therefore I chose another degree that utilizes art in a field that I’ve always found fascinating. I’m in between being a Landscape Architecture major, and Interior Design major, or an Architecture major. \\n\\nWhy? Because, I like to change things. I love creating spaces, ever since I was forced to learn how to draw a cube in elementary school. I love asking myself “how different could I make something fit in this space?”. Traditionalism is lost on me, and I like to challenge the idea of sameness. Why leave something as is when it can be different and potentially better?(*⁰▿⁰*)\\n\\nSo despite my financial trouble with the school for me trying to make up for my past mistakes that I’ve made in the last year and half of my life, my only regret is not starting with art. But I hate having regrets so I’m going to try and make up for these mistakes and actually do what I want to do. So maybe that this last year and half doesn’t serve as a reminder to my failures, depression, and suicidal ideation, cuz man what an exhausting year it was.\\n\\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk and hell of anyone sees this, maybe we could chat about your experiences if you could relate to this.(￣▽￣)\\n\\nTL;DR: this is an entire post about why I didn’t chose art as my first major in college and wasted a year and half of my life and how I’m now attempting to make up for my mistakes.', 'No one in College actually gives a damn about your mental health No one cares.

It did helped; it wasn’t the same experience, but it was better than remaining isolated by doing more online classes.\\n\\nBack to my topic, I just found out this morning that my Human Resource class changed from in person at the second campus to online. I’m both bewildered, and upset. I specifically wanted to do what I did last spring, and now I’m going back fully online again. It hurts so much when plans suddenly change. I have two options: keep the schedule or try to ask my advisor if it’s possible to change classes with something else that I’m able to take at the campus (sibling campus not main one). I’m contacting my advisor to ask why the change, and I’m wondering if it’s possible to change classes on the first day of college? I’ve never changed my schedule because prior to the first day, I carefully select what to take and who it has to teach. I’m usually content by my schedules the past years of my undergraduate life, but this time I’m conflicted. I really don’t want to do fully online again because I’m worried my depression will worsen again.', \"I'm having a hard time convincing myself college is worth it. I want to go into content production and social media strategy/management. Every job I've looked at has not required a degree.

I am constantly miserable to the point of severe depression during the semester because everything I'm doing feels like meaningless busywork. \\n\\nI want so badly to find even one shred of evidence that staying in college is the right thing to do. Just one thing that'll make me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile, and that my hard work will pay off in the long run.\", 'I’m done with college life.

I was in an awful organization my first two years of college. I haven’t had the best experiences with another organization I was involved in. I don’t even fit in with students in this other organization I’m only involved in because of scholarships. I don’t connect with college students. I don’t see the full value of a college education. College feels like a waste of time for me. \\n\\nFor the last year, I’ve been so unmotivated in my school work. I still feel unmotivated. I don’t know why exactly. Part of it is probably covid related. Another part of it is possibly because of anxiety/depression.\\n\\nI feel like I connect more with older people who aren’t in college for whatever reason. I would like to have college friends, but it seems that no one wants to hang with me. No one makes any effort to want to be with me.\\n\\nI got a lot more on my mind, but I don’t even know what else to say.\\n\\nTL;DR - I’m starting my fourth year of college, and I’m dreading it because I’m not enjoying college life.

I made like 5 friends at orientation and that’s it, I tried to look up some clubs but they’re essentially all inactive since the lockdown. In general it seems my campus was extremely impacted by covid. it didn’t seem to have a great social life to begin with but covid seemed to have killed what it had. \\n\\nI am a CS major and didn’t meet the prereqs to take core classes yet (I didn’t find this out until right before the semester began, I know very stupid on my part, this also seemed to have happened to a lot of others as well, though).

No one ever talks to anyone and everyone seems to just want to get on with everything here. Most people just go to class then go home here. I got a dorm in the beginning and it was completely dead, like doors always closed 24/7 no one ever talking ever. I just finished my freshman year and I don’t even give a fuck, I am so depressed and when I look back at this semester I’m extremely apathetic because I just went to class did my work and went home. Nothing else notable, no real experiences. I’m very miserable, I feel like a loser reminiscing on HS because at least stuff happened then. I know no one at my college and I’m just a random stranger to everyone and even though I’m a very introverted person that has been really depressing me, the lack of any community at all. In fact I’m still hanging out with just my HS friends because I haven’t met anyone I clicked with yet or anyone really. \\n\\nI could transfer to a nearby school but I’m pretty sure it’s too late.

Too useless and stupid for this “easy” online science class, so I’m dropping it and officially accepting my status as a failed loser/dropout who will never have a job.

But I\\'ll try...\\n\\nI basically graduated highschool just after I turned 15, a month later I was admitted into college but I decided to take a gap year.\\n\\nA year later, I am on my third week of classes as an engineering freshman.\\nI am having absolutely no problems with the academics so far, but there are these thoughts constantly raiding my head about how it\\'s going to be rough and that I might fall behind in the social and emotional aspects.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I am not the stereotypical Asperger\\'s kid that has no clue about socializing. I am actually outgoing, although a bit awkward, but I can become friends with people quite easily.\\n\\nI have made some great friends so far which I see on a daily basis, but I also didn\\'t know that the social environment would be that different from what I was used to. I feel so weird and emotionally drained by feeling way too young compared to everyone else.\\nI don\\'t know how it seems like almost everyone likes drinking and getting wasted every Friday? I don\\'t even like alcohol, although I get along pretty well  with all my course classmates and people from clubs, I know I\\'m going to get excluded and be left behind from a lot of things known as \"the college experience\".\\n\\nI am also completely in love with this girl from the Orchestra who\\'s also in engineering that I see, walk, joke, laugh and eat lunch together everyday. She\\'s 17 but turns 18 in December, she knows my age--which I tried to keep secret but it was impossible--but I am so frightened that my age is going to be yet again another factor for my emotional collapse.\\n\\nI\\'ve been feeling great with the friends I\\'ve made and the clubs I am in, and I don\\'t think I\\'m depressed, but I\\'m feeling like I\\'m falling behind and that I won\\'t ever get to experience \"the true experience\" (if that makes sense) due to my displaced age gap, either be it HS or college, because I wasn\\'t interested in these things when I was in HS because I wasn\\'t in the correct age group yet, and now that I have the HS age, I am worrying about this, and then for the \"college experience age\" I will have graduated.\\n\\nI feel like everybody\\'s changing from what my view of the world used to be, I feel like time is moving so unbelievably fast and I already need to make important decisions, I was not ready for all of this at such a young age, in reality not even my 18 year old classmates were ready for this, how am I supposed to deal with this, everything\\'s happening so fast.\\n\\nI\\'ve lost like 15 lbs since school started, I\\'ve been having horrendous sleep schedules all due to these thoughts that I don\\'t even know how to express.\\n\\nI really need advice, sorry if nothing of this rant made sense.\\n\\nTomorrow I have my first appointment with a therapist.', 'Haven\\'t done any coursework in 6 weeks, not sure how to go about this. Hello all, this is a throwaway account because I don\\'t want people I know to see this. Anyway let me explain my situation, I\\'m a student at uni studying computer science. I start the first few weeks off strong (I get fairly decent grades) however there was a death in the family that got me a little depressed in mid January. I was feeling down, I attended class but stopped doing work as I would say \"it\\'s fine to miss one week of work I\\'ll do it next week\". Fast forward a few weeks more of this depression and the fact that a few of my friends are still unemployed after graduating last fall. Suddenly a second family member died, this time it was a murder. Anyway long story short these events have made it hard for me to get back into studying. Now I\\'m really scared that I blew this semester and feel like a complete loser. I\\'ve been absolutely horrified to email my professors because I feel like I might get some bad answers from them (such as failing me/not helping me catch up etc). Anyway what do you guys think, any opinions? I\\'m basically writing this here to get it off my chest and calm my nerves but I really need some advice. Also sorry for my weird English, it\\'s a second language. Thanks', 'Is it bad to be in your second year of college and still can’t adjust to it? \\nI’m in my second year of college and I’m so tired of it already. I did part time last semester and doing it this semester as well. Last fall was hell for me, I felt so unmotivated and restless. My time management was all fucked up, draining classes, stressed, and I was depressed too. I’m still depressed and talking to a therapist since July 2020. College has made me so damn emotional.\\n\\nI don’t want to do anything at all. I just turned in my speech outline for my speech class, and it looks horrid. It’s due today, I can’t focus or have the willpower to do it. These past couple of weeks since school has started has been a little bit of mess for me. HOWEVER, I feel better than what I was feeling like last year. I guess it’s an improvement.\\n\\n(I just wanted to rant today.)', 'I feel like giving up Im just depressed and I don’t know how I’ve made it these past few weeks. I don’t know if I can even do the work ahead because it just gets harder and harder. Finals are going to hurt. I’m just ready to get it over with and see if I graduate….', 'I had enough of college… I had my presentation today, and my class is a really small one and there’s this girl who always laughs in some sort of a bully way. She was laughing at some parts of my presentation and I got kind of disappointed but I continued to present it. I was wondering if it’s alright to laugh at people’s presentation or was it a rude behaviour? Personally I find it super rude as I have never laughed at anyone’s presentation, and respected each and everyone. But they aren’t treating me the same way. They love to gang up against me too. It’s really humiliating and depressing at the same time. I have tried to be friends with them in my freshman year, but only to find out they are just toxic bullies and I should avoid them as much as possible. But I can’t, all the modules I’m studying are the same as theirs and no other Majors joins, which only conclude that I’ll be seeing them forever till I graduate. Someone please advise me if I should transfer college, or endure till I graduate? Thank you', 'I hate going back to offline class \\nWell, I have no choice because my university never has an online option. I have already studied online for 1 year plus and I absolutely love it. It is more manageable and I am able to focus better than real life class to be fair because well no students bother me when it is online and I can just toss the phone away if somebody bothers me, unlike in real life where I have to answer them in class. Yeah I know social interaction or going outside is important but I can do it with just online classes, I mean I can go out and have fun with friends instead of going out for university and staying at that depressed building for 5~8 hours straight. Also, I have to prepare to meet shitty classmate that I met during online class, I can block them online but now I have to face them. There will also be some shitty lecturer too expect we students to have no life other than study and do great in their class. All of these factors,\\xa0dystopian university building,\\nshitty real life classmates and lecturers\\xa0made me dreading to go to university starting from next week.\\n\\nCurrently, we have hybrid classes but only two days are online, I seriously don\\'t want to go back to normal, normal university wasn\\'t even good anyway, it just the same shit that I have to work on assignments or study for 10+ hours straight and have as low as 1 hour to 4 hours sleep even it is on online. Imagine now I have to cut down some time for travel and wake up earlier for going back to school. Thinking about all of them just make me feel depressed...\\n\\nJust here to rant a bit since some of my peers are excited to go back for \"socialization\", bet some of them will regret it too. Sorry...\\n\\nTL/DR: I dont like offline class and every aspect of it, enviroment, shitty classmates and lecturers. One week left before I have to go back become \"normal\" and it is dreading me.', 'Get support for yourself or other people If you’d like to talk to someone, confidential mental health support is free and available 24/7.\\n\\n**Inside the U.S.**\\n\\n* Crisis Text Line: Text CHAT to 741741\\n* Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Call or text 988\\n\\n**If you’re outside the U.S.**\\n\\n* [Find resources in your location](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058756471-What-are-support-resources-available-to-people-outside-the-U-S-)\\n\\n**If you’re not ready to talk to someone yet:**\\n\\n* [How to help yourself when you’re feeling suicidal](https://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/feeling-suicidal/helping-yourself-when-feeling-overwhelmed-and-suicidal/)\\n* [How to ask for help if you’re having thoughts of suicide](https://www.suicideinfo.ca/ask-help-feeling-suicidal/)\\n\\n**Additional resources for helping yourself and others:**\\n\\n* [How to help someone you know who’s talking about seriously hurting themselves or considering suicide](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513931-What-do-I-do-if-someone-talks-about-seriously-hurting-themselves-or-is-considering-suicide-)\\n* [More information and resources about where and how to find help](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCareResources/wiki/suicide_resources)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6z44cj5bx6f71.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=951f1a6c6b3de5741768248c31125db2220fd968', \"Brown vs Dartmouth for Biology and Premed Not sure if there's much of a difference between premed education/opportunities between these two schools, but I really liked the vibes of the two schools and the people I've met so far, so I really need a deciding factor between these two schools lol. \\n\\nBrown Pros:\\n\\n* Absolutely loved everything about campus and Providence\\n* Providence is a pretty diverse city, great food scene there\\n* Very heavy undergrad focus, lots of research opportunities avaiable with undergrad professors and at Warren Alpert School of Medicine\\n* people seem very laid back and collaborative \\n* open curriculum!!!!

The winter break following my disastrous first semester of sophomore year, I was a vessel without a soul, the Helena Star in human form with all the humanity sapped away. Surgeries might have cured my blindness and medications my brain, but there was no cure for my motivation. And the worst part is, *I didn\\'t even care.* I didn\\'t care about my goals, or dreams, or passions, because I didn\\'t have any. Truth to be told, agriculture was among the last things I was expecting to like. The only reason why I even started working on a farm in the first place was for NHS hours.\\n\\nWhen I got to the farm, though, something clicked. For the next one-and-a-half years, my soul bloomed like a bright yellow tapestry of canola flowers in late February. I spent my days sketching blueprints for agricultural devices, and my nights dreaming in fields of wild blueberry and yuzu. My dreams about the future of agriculture turned into my goals regarding the future of my life. In my 11th grade year, I maintained straight A+\\'s in seven AP classes, solely off the basis of my ambition in agriculture. Every single award, every single test score, every single leadership position, every single extracurricular...they all came through my passion for agriculture.\\n\\n**Advice:**\\n\\n* **Genuine passion shines above all else**: My deep, relentless passion for agriculture is what gave my life meaning and turned me from suicidal near-dropout to class role model. Above the facades of national awards and leadership positions, the thing that shined the brightest in my application was my passion. Find something you\\'re deeply passionate about. I don\\'t mean something you\\'re good at, or something you do because it makes a lot of money, or something you do because all your friends do, or something your parents make you do. This is different from a \"spike\". **A passion is something you want to do.** A \"spike\" is simply something you do to impress AOs. True passion shouldn\\'t need to be explained in an essay (\"I\\'m passionate about CS\"). It comes as naturally as the air you breathe. By finding your genuine passion and striving to accomplish it every day, you are helping your application. Perhaps more importantly, though, **you are helping yourself.**\\n* **Show your humanity:** You\\'re a human. Not a piece of paper. Show your augustness and your worthlessness, your ambition and your misery, the zenith of joys and the abyss of despair. Show the night you cried yourself to sleep after losing your first state competition, the day you first went to a supermarket on a brisk sunday morning, or any event--none too small--in between. Show the finality of your humanity and every little step it took to get there. In essence, capture the zeitgeist of what makes you, you.\\n* **People, not Numbers:** Tying in to the previous point, regarding describing nonprofits or leadership positions or the sorts in essays, focus on the people you helped. Tell stories about who they are. How they struggled. How your help benefitted them, how it changed their lives. I used exactly zero pieces of data across all my essays.

I am also more than honored to be on the UChicago waitlist since I submitted that application as a hail mary.\\n\\nHere’s the thing, however, that it often not told to students (myself included): the college process, for the vast majority of students, and is a complete and utter crapshoot. If you meet a certain threshold with your academic record, and you do not have a national award or otherwise wowing attribute, then you have a chance at the university you wish to attend. But it’s probably not much higher than the acceptance rate of that school. Beyond academic resume, the best you can do is work on your essays. A classmate of mine, who currently has a C in physics and a B in statistics was admitted to a top 5 school. Meanwhile, a 4.0 classmate of mine who has a 1580 SAT, incredible extracurriculars, and more linguistic flare than the majority of equally excellent students, was rejected from every single ivy, MIT, and Stanford. How, knowing these kids, can I justify this seeming injustice? I can’t. And that’s the just the problem: admission counselors cannot be expected to “get to know” the applicants terribly closely. So don’t read into the results too much. \\n\\nTake me for example. UChicago was the first competitive school I heard back from. WAITLISTED! Sure, my essays were fantastic but this must mean I will get into at least one of NDU, CMU, and Middlebury. Sike! And then waitlisted at Boston College? I supposed I won’t get into an Ivy or GTech, so Villanova it is! Juked again! because I end up getting into both Cornell and Georgia Tech. You never know where your journey will bring  you, so put your head down and work hard. \\n\\nThanks for reading! And good luck to all my fellow seniors embarking on the life’s next journey!

Said I'm exactly what Harvard is looking for and that he hopes I get in (this aged like milk)\\n\\nNorthwestern: -1000/10 my interviewer was really judgmental and basically criticized all of my answers and told me that someone like me would never get in lmao. gave me a really bad impression of the school.\\n\\nDartmouth: 7/10 it was really awkward because it was on the phone\\n\\nStanford: 9/10 the guy was super wholesome and also told me that I'm exactly the type of person they're looking for (which also aged like milk)\\n\\nDuke: 8/10 the interview itself was great, but it was over the phone and my interviewer's signal was super spotty which ended up causing a lot of problems. \\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI definitely don't think that the quality of my writing was the best. I just tried to be genuine in my essays and I think it worked for me! My personal statement was about growing up and working in my parents' small business. I think that because it's something really mundane and true to me, it may have made up for my less-than-stellar writing skills. \\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* State School 1\\n* State School 2 + BA/MD (too expensive tho sadly)\\n* ASU\\n* UofA\\n* USC w/ Trustee Scholarship (got no additional aid on top of that though)\\n* UMich (OOS)\\n* UNC Chapel Hill (OOS)\\n* WashU in St. Louis\\n* Rice University\\n* Northwestern University\\n* Duke University (attending!)\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* Case Western Reserve\\n* Emory \\n* Vanderbilt\\n* Dartmouth\\n* Columbia\\n* Harvard (REA --> deferred --> waitlisted)\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* Johns Hopkins\\n* Brown\\n* UPenn\\n* Stanford\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nsomething I forgot to clarify in my last post: I would've definitely gone with the BA/MD if it wasn't wayyyy too expensive despite not liking the program because who would turn down med school?! I tried appealing for more aid and they still gave me pretty much nothing, so I sadly had to decline the offer because the other schools gave me more aid. I still have no clue why they were expecting tens of thousands of dollars more PER YEAR than most of my schools. WashU, Rice, Northwestern, and Duke were all around the same price (and actually much more affordable, close\\nto a full ride), so I visited them after receiving travel grants and ended up liking Duke the most! It would've been nice to have guaranteed admission into med school, but I guess the universe didn't want it to happen lol. I had to make a difficult choice and decided that I would rather avoid drowning in debt in undergrad knowing that I'll probably have to take out more loans for med school.\", '(Above?)

She didn\\'t really have to do much to get them into T20s, they were basically a feeder. She had to learn a lot about our school and class to know how to better help us get into college, so my friends and I helped a lot. She was super young so we really liked her.

It was kind of rude I felt so bad.\\n3. I did 2 **Harvard interviews**. First guy was a lawyer, it was in person. At the end he said I was more qualified than him to go to harvard, definitely not true but I appreciated it.\\n4. **Second Harvard interview** was with an admissions officer.

He told me not to be nervous when I said I was super scared.\\n5. **UMichigan interview**, she was super cool, we talked about her mostly since I was really interested in hearing how someone in her major did after college.

Harvard, Yale, MIT AOs all personally told me they \"loved reading my application\". Wrote about how school was an escape from my shitty home life.

My US history teacher wrote one, and I am lucky enough to have her as a dorm advisor, meaning she has lived with me for 3 years. She and I have a tight relationship and I did extraordinarily well in her class—I’d rate it a 9.5/10. My calculus teacher wrote my other academic rec, and again we got along really well and I did really well in her class—8.5/10. My college counselor wrote my counselor rec, and he and I are top tier buds—10/10.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nNah I literally don’t remember any of them… they were decent, I think. I had EA interviews for each school that offered them (MIT and Case Western), and I’ve done RD interviews whenever offered (Carleton, Grinnell, Cornell, Harvard, Yale, Harvey Mudd, URochester). I did not get an interview for Columbia.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI think my essays are really, really strong. My CA personal statement discussed how I’ve explored different aspects of my identity (namely socioeconomic status and sexuality) through shitty fashion; I think it displayed who I am (not only these named identifiers but also personality) very effectively. I also believe my supplemental essays were good. My college counselor is using them as examples for future students.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Indiana University (CS, $11k/yr merit)\\n\\n* Purdue University (CS)\\n\\n* University of Rochester (Applied math, $25k/yr merit)\\n\\n* Carleton College (CS)\\n\\n* Grinnell College (CS, $27k/yr merit)\\n\\n* University of Michigan (CS, LSA)\\n\\n* Harvey Mudd College (CS/math, full tuition merit finalist)\\n\\n* California Institute of Technology (CS) (*COMMITTED!!!!

Right at the end of the first semester of my freshman year, my mom attempted suicide in front of me. My dad took custody of me (they divorced when I was 4) and I moved halfway across the state. She bounced in and out of jail that year. During my sophomore year, she jumped out of a window and broke three parts of her spine, landing her in a medically-induced coma. This same year, I applied to boarding schools and ended up repeating my sophomore year of high school voluntarily due to the educational gap between my past low-income high school and my new school. During my second sophomore year, she was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 18 months on house arrest. I don’t want to victimize myself in any way, and I don’t want sympathy, but these events heavily impacted my academics in high school.\\n\\n**Reflections:**\\n\\nMy advice to everyone going through the app process is to not be afraid to be a fucking mega dork in your application. I wrote about fucking Naruto and robotics whenever I could, and I got some damn good results.\\n\\nI wrote down some advice, if you so care:\\n\\n* Go with your gut! There were so many times throughout the application process where I just didn\\'t trust myself and my choices. My gut feeling was to go test optional at MIT, and I didn\\'t—now I\\'m just left with the \"what ifs\". Also, it is totally okay to judge colleges for yourself based on vibes. You don\\'t need some massive concrete, statistic reason to not apply to a school. If you get any bad vibe from it, then trust yourself.  It\\'s maybe not an awful idea to go with your gut feeling when you choose a school to attend, either. You\\'ll be spending ~4 years there; you don\\'t want to be miserable.\\n\\n* Don\\'t doubt yourself!! I applied to a lot of reaches, but there were some schools I didn\\'t apply to because for some reason I weirdly doubted I\\'d get in. I\\'m super happy with where I\\'m going, of course, but I wish I would\\'ve applied to Stanford!! I just did not think I would get in, so I didn\\'t even bother trying.\\n\\n* Don\\'t fear rejection. If there\\'s a school you really like, even if you feel like you have no chance at getting in, APPLY ANYWAY!\\n\\n* If you qualify for fee waivers, use them! I did not pay for a single college application-related expense, and it saved my ass so much. Please don\\'t feel embarrassed or shameful or anything—utilize these amazing resources.\\n\\n* If you are an underrepresented applicant, APPLY TO FLY-INS!!! So many top schools have fly-ins (MIT, Caltech, Dartmouth, Columbia, etc. etc.) and they\\'re super helpful with learning more about a school, especially within the lens of being from an underrepresented background. Also, I don\\'t know if they necessarily *help* you to get into a school, but there is a correlation between attending a fly-in and being admitted to a school. However, if you get rejected from the fly-in, that doesn\\'t mean you have no chance at that school. I got rejected from Columbia\\'s fly-in, yet I got a likely and a special scholar designation. My friend got rejected from Swarthmore\\'s fly-in but was accepted into the school RD. \\n\\n* Be YOU in your essays. Don\\'t be afraid of being conversational, in a way. I write the way I talk, and I got a lot of notes post-acceptance from schools saying that the AOs really got to know me through my essays and that they really appreciated reading my voice. If you naturally write a bit less or a bit more personal, that\\'s totally okay—just don\\'t try to force yourself into a different writing voice for your essays. I feel like that is where a lot of students struggle.\\n\\n* If you need financial aid, complete your FAFSA and CSS profile AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! Colleges are pains in the ass when it comes to finaid documentation. The quicker you submit your shit, the earlier you can iron out any issues within them, and you can avoid issues with receiving aid due to time.\\n\\n* STAY OFF R/CHANCEME. EVERY SINGLE COMMENTER ON THERE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE WHAT THEY\\'RE TALKING ABOUT!!! I was super anxious entering application season, and used r/chanceme more than once. I was repeatedly told I had no chance at MIT or Caltech and that my scores and GPA were way too low for any top school\\'s CS program. Clearly, they were very wrong. That subreddit is nothing but toxic and just blatantly incorrect. Please save yourself the worry!\\n\\n* Don\\'t get caught up in comparing yourself to other applicants, especially in self-selecting spaces like A2C. Every single person is different, and there\\'s no one type of applicant that is correct. If you have no research, or no work experience, or whatever, THAT\\'S PROBABLY COMPLETELY FINE!! You are yourself, and nobody else. Do what you love and do what you can do, because you are different from any other applicant. \\n\\n* Be kind to yourself. No matter what your application results are, you are worthy of love and praise.\\n\\nI don’t know. Don’t take my advice. I’m 19 and stupid as fuck.

Also just to share my stats because before getting into colleges I\\'d be on Reddit every day researching where am I going to apply and what are my chances, etc. I ended up committing to Syracuse University.\\n\\nSome terms you should know... HEOP is a grant from PRIVATE colleges (usually full-ride) for people who are from URM, have low grades and are very very very poor. When I say low grades I mean lower grades than what a college usually admits. Also usually people who apply to HEOP have an EFC of 0. EOP is the same exact thing but for PUBLIC colleges (SUNY\\'s). SEEK is the same thing but for CITY PUBLIC colleges (CUNY\\'s). HEOP, EOP, and SEEK are only for NEW YORKERS and colleges in NEW YORK.\\n\\nAlso, when I say \"16k extra, 14k extra\" it means I got a full ride but with x amount extra that I will recieve in a refund check.\\n\\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Female\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic/Black\\n* Residence: NYC (poorest neighborhood in manhattan)\\n* Income Bracket: 10k (under poverty)\\n* Type of School: Public (not any special school)\\n* EFC: 0\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM, Women in STEM and First-Gen\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: STEM (Computer Science)\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 82 or 2.7\\n* Rank (or percentile): 36 out of 87\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: AP Environmental Science - 2; AP English Language and Composition - 2 DID NOT SEND THOSE SCORES (grades in those classes above 85)\\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP English Literature and Composition, AP US History, Pre Calculus, Government and Economics and Teaching Assistance of Python Programming (wasn\\'t a graded class)\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n* SAT I: 1180 (600RW, 580M)\\n* AP/IB: AP Environmental Science - 2; AP English Language and Composition - 2 (did not send those scores)\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\n1.

Honor Roll 9-12th grade\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation**\\n\\n1. Advisor 11th/12th grade - An advisor in my school is like a homeroom teacher, but we have this class called advisory. Depending in what grade you\\'re in, there are different topics to discuss. 11th and 12th grade advisory is made specifically to focus on college success. Anyways, me and my advisor are really really close, we talk about everything going on in each other\\'s lives, and we hangout outside of class regularly. Probably one of my strongest recommendation letters talking about me on a personal level.\\n2. Math teacher 11th grade - This recommendation letter was asked for on a whim. I originally had planned for my old CS teacher to do my letter but he bailed at last minute so I asked my 11th grade math teacher to do it. I had an 100 in that class every marking period and the teacher liked me, but the teacher doesn\\'t know me as well. I\\'d imagine that the recommendation was great, but generic.\\n3. History teacher 10-12th grade - This man knows me the best academically because of the amount of emphasis and dedication I put into my work for this class. He knows somethings about me and we chit chat sometimes, but the strong point of this letter is my academics and my work ethic.\\n4. College Counselor - The places I was applying to required a recommendation letter from a counselor/assistant principal/principal. My college counselor wrote my letter. I met her in 12th grade and she knows me just because i was in her room often and she read my college essay. She probably wrote a good recommendation letter but not too personal, something along the lines of despite my struggles i want to persevere.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nDid two interviews and it was for University of Rochester.\\n\\nThe first one was an optional alumni interview, more like a conversation. I did the interview because it was one of my top schools. The interviewer and me met up at some coffee shop in nyc and we just talked about each other. He specifically asked me what i want to do in college, why did i want to go to U of R, why did I think i was a good fit, how am I going to participate in the community, etc. It was an AMAZING interview and i think this is what carried me to get accepted...\\n\\nThe second interview was a phone interview and it was the most important. Almost all the schools I was applying to was thru a special program in NY called HEOP/EOP, and to get admitted through that program, you must interview. This interview was for that program. They asked me generic questions, like whats my name, what school am I going to. Then they ask me what am i looking forward to at U of R and other things. Then the last question was what should i remember you as when discussing your application and i said something generic and dumb like \"oh I am a first gen student\" even though everyone applying through that program is most likely a first gen student, it was bad. Still got accepted full ride lmao.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI did about 3 drafts of my essay. My college counselor and Ap English teacher helped me. It was about saving a family member from suicide (like physically) and my favorite video game (I somehow merged those two topics). A few English teachers read my essay and they said it was one of the best they have read. I personally think it was REALLY good. It shows the struggle in my personal life and my economic status (which can be a reason why my grade is so low and is not proportionate to my SAT score) and it shows I have hobbies outside of school.\\n\\n**Decisions (all regular decision)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Le Moyne College (20k scholarship)\\n* New York Institute of Technology (20k scholarship)\\n* St. Lawrence University (HEOP - Full ride)\\n* SUNY Alfred State (EOP)\\n* SUNY Oswgo\\n* SUNY Polytechnic Institute (EOP)\\n* SUNY Stony Brook (EOP)\\n* SUNY Buffalo (EOP)\\n* SUNY Albany (EOP)\\n* Syracuse University (HEOP full ride)\\n* University of Rochester (HEOP full ride)\\n* CUNY Lehman College (Full ride with 16k extra)\\n* CUNY City College  (SEEK) (Full ride with 12k extra)\\n* CUNY Brooklyn College (Full ride with 14k extra)\\n* CUNY York College (Full ride with 14k extra)\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* SUNY Binghampton (HEOP admission to spring semester)\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* New York University (HEOP)\\n* Rochester Institute of Technology (HEOP)', 'Enby makes it big despite mid ECs (by A2C standards) **Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Non-binary (he/they)\\n* Race/Ethnicity: White\\n* Residence: So-so-cal\\n* Income Bracket: 100kish??\\n* Type of School: TINY and I mean TINY charter school\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): LGBTQ ig ☠️, grandma and great-grandma went to Pomona but I don\\'t think legacy works like that\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Chemical Engineering at targets/safeties, Math at reaches 💅\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 4.0 UW, 4.78 W\\n* Rank (or percentile): 1/40\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 6/6 Honors, 2/3 AP, 11 Dual Enrollment\\n* Senior Year Course Load:\\nAP Lit, Honors History at high school; equivalent of Spanish IV, a weird into to bio class, and Discrete Math at the junior college\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n* SAT I: 1510 (730RW 780M)\\n* AP/IB: English Language (5), English Literature (haven\\'t taken it but probably gonna be a 5? my teacher is hella good lmao)\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\nThis sub and A2C made me feel super inadequate!!!!!\\n\\n1.

Like she talked about the time I spent weeks in her tutoring in order to fix an essay which I was hoping she would, but the rest was just kinda like \"yeah he\\'s pretty smart let them in ☠️\"\\n\\nCounselor (6+/10): I know she mentioned that I had the highest GPA she had seen at my school in her entire career here which would be pretty powerful \\n\\nHospital Volunteer Manager (5/10?): Haven\\'t seen this one either but I didn\\'t end up using it for most of my reach colleges bc I learned before RD day that she does kinda generic ones. Instead, I used...\\n\\nHospital Main Desk Manager (7+/10): I got the vibe that hers was very good though just because she kept taking about how she liked to \"tell a story\" with her LORs. I also think she wrote an LOR for a main desk volunteer who got into Brown last year so hey, good luck?!?\\n\\nSurveying/Engineering Firm Boss (5+/10???

No, not my AP exam score. My grade, as in the-number-on-your-report-card grade. And yes, before you ask, it was out of 100 maximum points. At the time, I had over 20 zeroes in my gradebook, and not a single class was above a 70.\\n\\nThis lasted for the duration of two eye surgeries and a hilariously bad suicide attempt. In other words, 30 days. I was blind, in both my physical sight and personal vision.\\n\\nAt this point, you might be wondering why I\\'m writing about this. Yeah, I guess it can serve as an inspiration to others--showing that, regardless of your current state, all hope is not lost. But, perhaps selfishly, this segment also serves as a reminder to **me.** *Damn. Look how far you\\'ve gotten, huh?* Ever since becoming devoted to agriculture, getting a \"Congratulations\" from Cornell has been my false azure. A fantasy so pure that, even a month after my acceptance, it still feels like imagination and not my reality. (I\\'ve made my acceptance letter my desktop wallpaper, lest I become swayed by the false prophets that habituate my head.)\\n\\nAnd let\\'s talk about agriculture, shall we? The winter break following my disastrous first semester of sophomore year, I was a vessel without a soul, the Helena Star in human form with all the humanity sapped away. Surgeries might have cured my blindness and medications my brain, but there was no cure for my motivation. And the worst part is, *I didn\\'t even care.* I didn\\'t care about my goals, or dreams, or passions, because I didn\\'t have any. Truth to be told, agriculture was among the last things I was expecting to like. The only reason why I even started working on a farm in the first place was for NHS hours.\\n\\nWhen I got to the farm, though, something clicked. For the next one-and-a-half years, my soul bloomed like a bright yellow tapestry of canola flowers in late February. I spent my days sketching blueprints for agricultural devices, and my nights dreaming in fields of wild blueberry and yuzu. My dreams about the future of agriculture turned into my goals regarding the future of my life. In my 11th grade year, I maintained straight A+\\'s in seven AP classes, solely off the basis of my ambition in agriculture. Every single award, every single test score, every single leadership position, every single extracurricular...they all came through my passion for agriculture.\\n\\n**Advice:**\\n\\n* **Genuine passion shines above all else**: My deep, relentless passion for agriculture is what gave my life meaning and turned me from suicidal near-dropout to class role model. Above the facades of national awards and leadership positions, the thing that shined the brightest in my application was my passion. Find something you\\'re deeply passionate about. I don\\'t mean something you\\'re good at, or something you do because it makes a lot of money, or something you do because all your friends do, or something your parents make you do. This is different from a \"spike\". **A passion is something you want to do.** A \"spike\" is simply something you do to impress AOs. True passion shouldn\\'t need to be explained in an essay (\"I\\'m passionate about CS\"). It comes as naturally as the air you breathe. By finding your genuine passion and striving to accomplish it every day, you are helping your application. Perhaps more importantly, though, **you are helping yourself.**\\n* **Show your humanity:** You\\'re a human. Not a piece of paper. Show your augustness and your worthlessness, your ambition and your misery, the zenith of joys and the abyss of despair. Show the night you cried yourself to sleep after losing your first state competition, the day you first went to a supermarket on a brisk sunday morning, or any event--none too small--in between. Show the finality of your humanity and every little step it took to get there. In essence, capture the zeitgeist of what makes you, you.\\n* **People, not Numbers:** Tying in to the previous point, regarding describing nonprofits or leadership positions or the sorts in essays, focus on the people you helped. Tell stories about who they are. How they struggled. How your help benefitted them, how it changed their lives. I used exactly zero pieces of data across all my essays. You should too.', 'Mental health brown boy gets relatively expected results \\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Male\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Indian\\n* Residence: US Citizen\\n* Income Bracket: ~150k\\n* Type of School: public \\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): none\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Cognitive Science \\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): ~3.8 UW, 4.45W\\n* Rank (or percentile): 35/530\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 13 AP, 1 DE, Most of the rest are honors\\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP Calc AB, AP Lit, Principles of BioMed PLTW, AP gov, AP Macro, AP Stats, AP Chem, AP bio, online pe and fitness\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\\n\\n* SAT I: 1510 (730RW, 780M)\\n* AP/IB: Psych (4), Lang (4), Apush (4)\\n* Other (ex.

I am also more than honored to be on the UChicago waitlist since I submitted that application as a hail mary.\\n\\nHere’s the thing, however, that it often not told to students (myself included): the college process, for the vast majority of students, and is a complete and utter crapshoot. If you meet a certain threshold with your academic record, and you do not have a national award or otherwise wowing attribute, then you have a chance at the university you wish to attend. But it’s probably not much higher than the acceptance rate of that school. Beyond academic resume, the best you can do is work on your essays. A classmate of mine, who currently has a C in physics and a B in statistics was admitted to a top 5 school. Meanwhile, a 4.0 classmate of mine who has a 1580 SAT, incredible extracurriculars, and more linguistic flare than the majority of equally excellent students, was rejected from every single ivy, MIT, and Stanford. How, knowing these kids, can I justify this seeming injustice? I can’t. And that’s the just the problem: admission counselors cannot be expected to “get to know” the applicants terribly closely. So don’t read into the results too much. \\n\\nTake me for example. UChicago was the first competitive school I heard back from. WAITLISTED! Sure, my essays were fantastic but this must mean I will get into at least one of NDU, CMU, and Middlebury. Sike! And then waitlisted at Boston College? I supposed I won’t get into an Ivy or GTech, so Villanova it is! Juked again! because I end up getting into both Cornell and Georgia Tech. You never know where your journey will bring  you, so put your head down and work hard. \\n\\nThanks for reading! And good luck to all my fellow seniors embarking on the life’s next journey!

I just tried to be genuine in my essays and I think it worked for me! My personal statement was about growing up and working in my parents' small business.

I tried appealing for more aid and they still gave me pretty much nothing, so I sadly had to decline the offer because the other schools gave me more aid. I still have no clue why they were expecting tens of thousands of dollars more PER YEAR than most of my schools. WashU, Rice, Northwestern, and Duke were all around the same price (and actually much more affordable, close\\nto a full ride), so I visited them after receiving travel grants and ended up liking Duke the most! It would've been nice to have guaranteed admission into med school, but I guess the universe didn't want it to happen lol. I had to make a difficult choice and decided that I would rather avoid drowning in debt in undergrad knowing that I'll probably have to take out more loans for med school.\", 'urm, first-gen girlie with a very low gpa shotguns and...makes it? \\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Female\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Black\\n* Residence: NJ\\n* Income Bracket: Middle Class (60-70k parent income)\\n* Type of School: A Very Good Boarding School in NJ not far from Princeton...\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM, First-Gen\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Theatre/PoliSci/ Business at like two schools\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.3 UW\\n* Rank (or percentile): no ranking!\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: School doesn’t officially do AP’s, and only started taking honors classes this year. \\n\\n* Senior Year Course Load: 5 Honors Classes a term\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\\n\\n* SAT I: 1430 (720 RW, 710M)\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\n*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*\\n\\n1. summer social justice camp for two years where we did a lot of volunteer work, now serving on their youth council\\n2. barnard’s pre-college program (studied prison reform &amp;amp; abolition)\\n3. dorm president last year &amp;amp; prefect (R.A.) this year\\n4. president of a black women affinity group junior year\\n5. community service mentoring program for three years \\n6. eight theatre productions throughout high school\\n7. a mission trip to haiti (i was forced to put this one, i was going to omit it 💀)\\n8. ropes course instructor for two years (my school has a huge outdoor rock climbing facility, R.C.I.’s lead freshman orientation and are trained to belay people on the course \\n9. i serve on my school’s honor council (whenever someone gets in trouble, i might get called to vote on whether they get our biggest disciplinary response)\\n10. head tour guide\\n\\n**Awards/Honors**\\n\\n1.

She didn\\'t really have to do much to get them into T20s, they were basically a feeder. She had to learn a lot about our school and class to know how to better help us get into college, so my friends and I helped a lot. She was super young so we really liked her.

He told me not to be nervous when I said I was super scared.\\n5. **UMichigan interview**, she was super cool, we talked about her mostly since I was really interested in hearing how someone in her major did after college.

Then I edited it again the night Georgia Tech was due. Then again the night Questbridge Match was due. you get the idea. 10/10 ig, but hindsight is 20/20. Harvard, Yale, MIT AOs all personally told me they \"loved reading my application\". Wrote about how school was an escape from my shitty home life.

My US history teacher wrote one, and I am lucky enough to have her as a dorm advisor, meaning she has lived with me for 3 years. She and I have a tight relationship and I did extraordinarily well in her class—I’d rate it a 9.5/10. My calculus teacher wrote my other academic rec, and again we got along really well and I did really well in her class—8.5/10. My college counselor wrote my counselor rec, and he and I are top tier buds—10/10.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nNah I literally don’t remember any of them… they were decent, I think. I had EA interviews for each school that offered them (MIT and Case Western), and I’ve done RD interviews whenever offered (Carleton, Grinnell, Cornell, Harvard, Yale, Harvey Mudd, URochester). I did not get an interview for Columbia.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI think my essays are really, really strong. My CA personal statement discussed how I’ve explored different aspects of my identity (namely socioeconomic status and sexuality) through shitty fashion; I think it displayed who I am (not only these named identifiers but also personality) very effectively. I also believe my supplemental essays were good. My college counselor is using them as examples for future students.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Indiana University (CS, $11k/yr merit)\\n\\n* Purdue University (CS)\\n\\n* University of Rochester (Applied math, $25k/yr merit)\\n\\n* Carleton College (CS)\\n\\n* Grinnell College (CS, $27k/yr merit)\\n\\n* University of Michigan (CS, LSA)\\n\\n* Harvey Mudd College (CS/math, full tuition merit finalist)\\n\\n* California Institute of Technology (CS) (*COMMITTED!!!!

Right at the end of the first semester of my freshman year, my mom attempted suicide in front of me. My dad took custody of me (they divorced when I was 4) and I moved halfway across the state. She bounced in and out of jail that year. During my sophomore year, she jumped out of a window and broke three parts of her spine, landing her in a medically-induced coma. This same year, I applied to boarding schools and ended up repeating my sophomore year of high school voluntarily due to the educational gap between my past low-income high school and my new school. During my second sophomore year, she was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 18 months on house arrest. I don’t want to victimize myself in any way, and I don’t want sympathy, but these events heavily impacted my academics in high school.\\n\\n**Reflections:**\\n\\nMy advice to everyone going through the app process is to not be afraid to be a fucking mega dork in your application. I wrote about fucking Naruto and robotics whenever I could, and I got some damn good results.\\n\\nI wrote down some advice, if you so care:\\n\\n* Go with your gut! There were so many times throughout the application process where I just didn\\'t trust myself and my choices. My gut feeling was to go test optional at MIT, and I didn\\'t—now I\\'m just left with the \"what ifs\". Also, it is totally okay to judge colleges for yourself based on vibes. You don\\'t need some massive concrete, statistic reason to not apply to a school. If you get any bad vibe from it, then trust yourself.  It\\'s maybe not an awful idea to go with your gut feeling when you choose a school to attend, either. You\\'ll be spending ~4 years there; you don\\'t want to be miserable.\\n\\n* Don\\'t doubt yourself!! I applied to a lot of reaches, but there were some schools I didn\\'t apply to because for some reason I weirdly doubted I\\'d get in. I\\'m super happy with where I\\'m going, of course, but I wish I would\\'ve applied to Stanford!! I just did not think I would get in, so I didn\\'t even bother trying.\\n\\n* Don\\'t fear rejection. If there\\'s a school you really like, even if you feel like you have no chance at getting in, APPLY ANYWAY!\\n\\n* If you qualify for fee waivers, use them! I did not pay for a single college application-related expense, and it saved my ass so much. Please don\\'t feel embarrassed or shameful or anything—utilize these amazing resources.\\n\\n* If you are an underrepresented applicant, APPLY TO FLY-INS!!! So many top schools have fly-ins (MIT, Caltech, Dartmouth, Columbia, etc. etc.) and they\\'re super helpful with learning more about a school, especially within the lens of being from an underrepresented background. Also, I don\\'t know if they necessarily *help* you to get into a school, but there is a correlation between attending a fly-in and being admitted to a school. However, if you get rejected from the fly-in, that doesn\\'t mean you have no chance at that school. I got rejected from Columbia\\'s fly-in, yet I got a likely and a special scholar designation. My friend got rejected from Swarthmore\\'s fly-in but was accepted into the school RD. \\n\\n* Be YOU in your essays. Don\\'t be afraid of being conversational, in a way. I write the way I talk, and I got a lot of notes post-acceptance from schools saying that the AOs really got to know me through my essays and that they really appreciated reading my voice. If you naturally write a bit less or a bit more personal, that\\'s totally okay—just don\\'t try to force yourself into a different writing voice for your essays. I feel like that is where a lot of students struggle.\\n\\n* If you need financial aid, complete your FAFSA and CSS profile AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! Colleges are pains in the ass when it comes to finaid documentation. The quicker you submit your shit, the earlier you can iron out any issues within them, and you can avoid issues with receiving aid due to time.\\n\\n* STAY OFF R/CHANCEME. EVERY SINGLE COMMENTER ON THERE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE WHAT THEY\\'RE TALKING ABOUT!!! I was super anxious entering application season, and used r/chanceme more than once. I was repeatedly told I had no chance at MIT or Caltech and that my scores and GPA were way too low for any top school\\'s CS program. Clearly, they were very wrong. That subreddit is nothing but toxic and just blatantly incorrect. Please save yourself the worry!\\n\\n* Don\\'t get caught up in comparing yourself to other applicants, especially in self-selecting spaces like A2C. Every single person is different, and there\\'s no one type of applicant that is correct. If you have no research, or no work experience, or whatever, THAT\\'S PROBABLY COMPLETELY FINE!! You are yourself, and nobody else. Do what you love and do what you can do, because you are different from any other applicant. \\n\\n* Be kind to yourself. No matter what your application results are, you are worthy of love and praise.\\n\\nI don’t know. Don’t take my advice. I’m 19 and stupid as fuck. Do what feels right to you!', 'results of a low test score premed applicant from the pnw! \\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: female\\n* Race/Ethnicity: White\\n* Residence: WA\\n* Income Bracket: Around 150,000\\n* Type of School: Public, large \\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None lol\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Neuroscience & premed track\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.95 (school doesn’t weight)\\n* Rank (or percentile): School doesn’t rank\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 7 AP’s, 3 honors & 2 DE\\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP Lit, AP Calc, AP Stats, AP Gov, German 4, Anatomy & Physiology, Yearbook/Newspaper\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\\n\\n* SAT I: None\\n* ACT: 32 (34E, 29M, 34R, 31S)\\n* SAT II: None\\n* AP/IB: APUSH (3), AP Psych (4), AP World (4)\\n* Other (ex.

I just wanted to throw my name in to see what happened lol but I know my application just wasn’t strong enough.', 'Terrible Hispanic/Black Female Applying for Computer Science in NY (HEOP and EOP) Hello, I decided to make a Reddit post because there are VERY few resources on the internet for people applying to college in NY through HEOP/EOP and SEEK. Also just to share my stats because before getting into colleges I\\'d be on Reddit every day researching where am I going to apply and what are my chances, etc. I ended up committing to Syracuse University.\\n\\nSome terms you should know... HEOP is a grant from PRIVATE colleges (usually full-ride) for people who are from URM, have low grades and are very very very poor. When I say low grades I mean lower grades than what a college usually admits. Also usually people who apply to HEOP have an EFC of 0. EOP is the same exact thing but for PUBLIC colleges (SUNY\\'s). SEEK is the same thing but for CITY PUBLIC colleges (CUNY\\'s). HEOP, EOP, and SEEK are only for NEW YORKERS and colleges in NEW YORK.\\n\\nAlso, when I say \"16k extra, 14k extra\" it means I got a full ride but with x amount extra that I will recieve in a refund check.\\n\\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Female\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic/Black\\n* Residence: NYC (poorest neighborhood in manhattan)\\n* Income Bracket: 10k (under poverty)\\n* Type of School: Public (not any special school)\\n* EFC: 0\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM, Women in STEM and First-Gen\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: STEM (Computer Science)\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 82 or 2.7\\n* Rank (or percentile): 36 out of 87\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: AP Environmental Science - 2; AP English Language and Composition - 2 DID NOT SEND THOSE SCORES (grades in those classes above 85)\\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP English Literature and Composition, AP US History, Pre Calculus, Government and Economics and Teaching Assistance of Python Programming (wasn\\'t a graded class)\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n* SAT I: 1180 (600RW, 580M)\\n* AP/IB: AP Environmental Science - 2; AP English Language and Composition - 2 (did not send those scores)\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\n1.

Honor Roll 9-12th grade\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation**\\n\\n1. Advisor 11th/12th grade - An advisor in my school is like a homeroom teacher, but we have this class called advisory. Depending in what grade you\\'re in, there are different topics to discuss. 11th and 12th grade advisory is made specifically to focus on college success. Anyways, me and my advisor are really really close, we talk about everything going on in each other\\'s lives, and we hangout outside of class regularly. Probably one of my strongest recommendation letters talking about me on a personal level.\\n2. Math teacher 11th grade - This recommendation letter was asked for on a whim. I originally had planned for my old CS teacher to do my letter but he bailed at last minute so I asked my 11th grade math teacher to do it. I had an 100 in that class every marking period and the teacher liked me, but the teacher doesn\\'t know me as well. I\\'d imagine that the recommendation was great, but generic.\\n3. History teacher 10-12th grade - This man knows me the best academically because of the amount of emphasis and dedication I put into my work for this class. He knows somethings about me and we chit chat sometimes, but the strong point of this letter is my academics and my work ethic.\\n4. College Counselor - The places I was applying to required a recommendation letter from a counselor/assistant principal/principal. My college counselor wrote my letter. I met her in 12th grade and she knows me just because i was in her room often and she read my college essay. She probably wrote a good recommendation letter but not too personal, something along the lines of despite my struggles i want to persevere.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nDid two interviews and it was for University of Rochester.\\n\\nThe first one was an optional alumni interview, more like a conversation. I did the interview because it was one of my top schools. The interviewer and me met up at some coffee shop in nyc and we just talked about each other. He specifically asked me what i want to do in college, why did i want to go to U of R, why did I think i was a good fit, how am I going to participate in the community, etc. It was an AMAZING interview and i think this is what carried me to get accepted...\\n\\nThe second interview was a phone interview and it was the most important. Almost all the schools I was applying to was thru a special program in NY called HEOP/EOP, and to get admitted through that program, you must interview. This interview was for that program. They asked me generic questions, like whats my name, what school am I going to. Then they ask me what am i looking forward to at U of R and other things. Then the last question was what should i remember you as when discussing your application and i said something generic and dumb like \"oh I am a first gen student\" even though everyone applying through that program is most likely a first gen student, it was bad. Still got accepted full ride lmao.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI did about 3 drafts of my essay. My college counselor and Ap English teacher helped me. It was about saving a family member from suicide (like physically) and my favorite video game (I somehow merged those two topics). A few English teachers read my essay and they said it was one of the best they have read. I personally think it was REALLY good. It shows the struggle in my personal life and my economic status (which can be a reason why my grade is so low and is not proportionate to my SAT score) and it shows I have hobbies outside of school.\\n\\n**Decisions (all regular decision)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Le Moyne College (20k scholarship)\\n* New York Institute of Technology (20k scholarship)\\n* St. Lawrence University (HEOP - Full ride)\\n* SUNY Alfred State (EOP)\\n* SUNY Oswgo\\n* SUNY Polytechnic Institute (EOP)\\n* SUNY Stony Brook (EOP)\\n* SUNY Buffalo (EOP)\\n* SUNY Albany (EOP)\\n* Syracuse University (HEOP full ride)\\n* University of Rochester (HEOP full ride)\\n* CUNY Lehman College (Full ride with 16k extra)\\n* CUNY City College  (SEEK) (Full ride with 12k extra)\\n* CUNY Brooklyn College (Full ride with 14k extra)\\n* CUNY York College (Full ride with 14k extra)\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* SUNY Binghampton (HEOP admission to spring semester)\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* New York University (HEOP)\\n* Rochester Institute of Technology (HEOP)', 'Enby makes it big despite mid ECs (by A2C standards) **Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Non-binary (he/they)\\n* Race/Ethnicity: White\\n* Residence: So-so-cal\\n* Income Bracket: 100kish??\\n* Type of School: TINY and I mean TINY charter school\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): LGBTQ ig ☠️, grandma and great-grandma went to Pomona but I don\\'t think legacy works like that\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Chemical Engineering at targets/safeties, Math at reaches 💅\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 4.0 UW, 4.78 W\\n* Rank (or percentile): 1/40\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 6/6 Honors, 2/3 AP, 11 Dual Enrollment\\n* Senior Year Course Load:\\nAP Lit, Honors History at high school; equivalent of Spanish IV, a weird into to bio class, and Discrete Math at the junior college\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n* SAT I: 1510 (730RW 780M)\\n* AP/IB: English Language (5), English Literature (haven\\'t taken it but probably gonna be a 5? my teacher is hella good lmao)\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\nThis sub and A2C made me feel super inadequate!!!!!\\n\\n1.

I also was TAing for him while he was writing and that in addition to having him as a teacher for 3 years had to have been good, right?\\n\\n9, 11-12th English teacher (6/10): Also had this teacher for 3 years and despite saying she would be eager to write my recommendation it was kinda... mid when I ended up seeing it after submitting all my apps and needing it for a scholarship. Like she talked about the time I spent weeks in her tutoring in order to fix an essay which I was hoping she would, but the rest was just kinda like \"yeah he\\'s pretty smart let them in ☠️\"\\n\\nCounselor (6+/10): I know she mentioned that I had the highest GPA she had seen at my school in her entire career here which would be pretty powerful \\n\\nHospital Volunteer Manager (5/10?): Haven\\'t seen this one either but I didn\\'t end up using it for most of my reach colleges bc I learned before RD day that she does kinda generic ones. Instead, I used...\\n\\nHospital Main Desk Manager (7+/10): I got the vibe that hers was very good though just because she kept taking about how she liked to \"tell a story\" with her LORs. I also think she wrote an LOR for a main desk volunteer who got into Brown last year so hey, good luck?!?\\n\\nSurveying/Engineering Firm Boss (5+/10??? Ferpa is scary): He strikes me as the anti-intellectual, college is too liberal type so it was maybe a risk using him. idk tho, he seems super business smart and probably talked about my work ethic and shit idk\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nU of Rochester (9/10): 1st interview, low stress, impressed interviewer, managed to say everything I wanted to 🤷🏼\\n\\nLafayette College (7/10): Awkward at first for some reason, but I had already met with the admissions counselor at events around my county before so I was able to recover and give ok answers?

My mother was obsessed with it idk why but I had to do this interview.\\n\\nSwarthmore (10/10): LOVED my interviewer and it ended up lasting an hour and a half. He asked to see some of the writings and photos I had written/taken, but when I sent them he didn\\'t respond ☠️. REGARDLESS, it was such a great experience and we bonded about both being from homophobic backgrounds and stuff and omg i need to email him to thank him/catch up 😭\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nIn order of completion:\\n\\nPersonal Statement (8/10): Resisted the urge to say \"I\\'m queer and I\\'m here\" and instead wrote a letter addressed to music, coming to terms with mediocrity in musical performance despite a decade of practice and how I still loved doing it even when I wasn\\'t \"good.\" used it to explore most aspects of my life, and all my friends and teachers loved it! I feel like I could have been less on the nose about some of my \"flexes\" but idk I like it :)\\n\\nPepperdine (4/10): My mom made me apply.\\n\\nU of Florida Gainesville, U of Tulsa (both 6/10): My mom made me apply but I tried kinda harder on these idk\\n\\nUC PIQs (7/10, 8/10, 7/10, 9/10): I forget which prompts I did but the first was about leadership and how I used my cishet-passing appearance alongside my tenure as XC team captain to change one kid\\'s perspective on \"the gays 😱😱\"\\nthe second was my personal statement just shortened\\nthe third had a silly little discrete math equation as the hook and then I was cringe and said I was good at problem-solving\\nthe fourth was a love letter to hospital volunteering and it\\'s probably the best essay I wrote in the entire application process \\n\\nLafayette College (9/10): Did a perfect supplemental essays that demonstrated my research of the courses, faculty, and resources of the college. A bit boring 🤷🏼\\n\\nJHU (5/10): Despite being my dream school, I only really listed 2 specific things specific to JHU that made me want to go there ☠️. the rest of the 400 words were me delving into a mid metaphor about human interests and clay.\\n\\nSwarthmore (7/10): Clay essay version 2. More well-thought-out but still clay. It wasn\\'t a \"Why Swarthmore\" essay so that\\'s why I\\'m putting it higher.\\n\\nBrown (7/10, 6/10, 9/10):\\n1st was Clay essay v3, still clay but probably the best it could get!\\n2nd was me complaining about this one fucker at my school but my friends who didn\\'t even know him liked it a lot idk.

I studied YouTube and Google **RELIGIOUSLY** (what made an essay brilliant? how did it make me feel?) - I was able to discover that individuals who were skilled at writing college application essays wrote in certain elegant and witty ways. They made basic human experiences seem so **authentic and revealing.** I watched SO MANY college essay videos and picked up on certain stylistic techniques. One of my favorite YouTubers during this time was Nicholas Chae.\\n2. I spent countless hours in cafes writing essays for each school. I maybe went through **three or four drafts** for each question trying to perfect every little thing. I really enjoyed this process though, it was like perfecting an art piece.\\n3. NOW FOR CONTENT - This is just my opinion, so please take it lightly. In the back of my mind, I knew I had one advantage. That advantage was creating a cohesive story with my application. I knew students in the same application pool had certain \"why\\'s\" to their writing.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"why do you want to study business\" - countless applicants will mention how winning some business competition, or interning at X, or investing in X stock, or running some shoe-reselling business motivated them to explore business management or finance. I knew so many people showcasing themselves in this light.\\n\\nI decided to take the riskier route.\\n\\nRather than stressing my experience with business, I decided to tie my experiences with journalism, creative writing, and photography in order to bring together a story that showed my **unique motives and values** (while still hinting at my interest in business or economics of course).\\n\\nBy doing so, I believe I stood out from applicants with \"generic\" stories since I tied together a unique combination of hobbies and interests alongside my career interests.\\n\\nMy personal statement was a story about Play-Doh.

Grades** \\\\- There was a brief period where I was legitimately depressed after looking at the average accepted GPA of the universities that I was interested in. Looking back, it was absolutely bizarre to think that someone with a 3.3 GPA could even break into a T-30 school at best. On top of all of this, the first semester of my junior year I received a 2.9 GPA with one C-. In total, there were four C\\'s on my transcript. My school does not have a weighted GPA scale or rank, so my 3.3 is literally all I had to show\\n\\n**2. No Test Scores** \\\\- During COVID, scheduling for the SAT was the absolute worst. I was racing to somehow take this test since it only hurt me to not send a score since my grades were so low. However, the testing site cancelled last minute, and I had to face these T-20 schools with a 3.3.\\n\\n**3. Out of State** \\\\- Not sure if this is a big factor, but I am certain out of state applicants have some sort of disadvantage for UC\\'s.\\n\\n**4. No Hooks**\\n\\n**How Did I Do It?**\\n\\n**1. Do Not Let the Noise Faze You** \\\\- I have vivid memories scrolling through chance me and feeling so horrible about my application. On my old reddit account, I asked a question pertaining to having a low GPA and was bombarded with responses like \"these schools will just filter your application out\". Although that is probably true for all the schools that rejected me, SOME SCHOOLS WILL TAKE THE CHANCE ON YOU.\\n\\n**2. By Being Unique** \\\\- I had an interesting spin to my application. Although I was interested in business, my extracurriculars, writing, and awards included many creative endeavors.\\n\\nBottom line, colleges care deeply about academics. It\\'s the first thing they look at. It\\'s evidence to predict if you will will excel in university. However, I realized that if you are someone with poor grades, you just have to carry that weight. Maybe if I put more effort into school I wouldn\\'t have to put countless hours into writing.\\n\\n*However, I liked how it turned out.*', \"Cornell vs Northwestern for CS Please help !!

When the waitlists/rejections started pouring in, I was crumbling. UCSC was the final blow. For the first time in my life, I was doubting my reality. My life literally felt like it was a dream. I had been so confident when applying (as evinced by my school list) that getting waitlisted from UCSC+others fucking killed me. I experienced a blend of depression and relief (thinking \\'the dream\\' was gonna end soon). One of the weirdest prolonged experiences of my life. Also,my dream school had been Berkeley for 4 years (like I set my pfp and wallpaper on everything to it) so that rejection felt like it invalidated my life.*\\n\\n*It took me a while to realize that it really is what you do inside college that defines your success, not the name of the school you go to. This is true, especially for CS. Also, my grad school name will eclipse anything I had for undergrad. My parents didn\\'t give two shits where I\\'d go to college, but I did. As a result, I felt like a failure (still do but less). Anyways, I recently committed to ASU Barrett and I\\'m grateful I have that I guess. I\\'m still embarrassed to tell people I\\'m going to a \"party school\" though. For example \"Hey {insert my name}, which school are you going to? MIT?\" \"no. asu.\" \"oh.\" I truly wish anyone reading this does not have the same experience I did because it was genuinely terrible.*', 'Rejected Brown ED **Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Male\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (Filipino)\\n* Residence: Nevada\\n* Income Bracket: $300k+\\n* Type of School: Private\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Mech.

Even though I got into Michigan, I could not go due to them wanting me to pay 20,000 with an additional 5,000 for the summer program they put me in, which I could not accept because I’m trying to save my college fund for medical school so paying it just would have set me back in my goal. So after much back and forth and thinking, I decided I will attend UW Madison in the fall yayyyy. Though I was bummed about my rejection’s like UCLA, which was my number 1 dream school I realized that hey, you win some, you lose so some. Anyway, I’m proud of myself that I got through it all and graduated, and I can’t wait for my next chapter in life which is college.

My Algebra 2 and AP Calc teacher. When I took Calc 2, she didn\\'t like me because I corrected her a lot of the time (Yes, I know that was pretty stupid of me and annoying af).

Despite graduating from Duke over a decade ago, my interviewer was very well-informed about the university and kept the conversation flowing at a natural and calming pace.\\n* Princeton - Another well-off interview.

However, they also felt pretty generic in the field of other college applications. My first essay talked about my journey of dealing with depression through the first two years of high school and how I used poetry to help me cope and eventually get over my depression. My second essay talked about my experience as a teenager working in corporate America at International Trademark Association. None of these essays really highlighted my interest in computer science although it explained who I was as an individual and how my experiences as an individual changed me into the person I am today.

My junior year of school was *very* rough because of remote learning. I live in a very disruptive home environment for me (people who are the same understand how bad it is), and I got extremely depressed. Got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and anxiety induced insomnia. It really sucked being at home all the time and having to repress my queerness at home because of unaccepting parents. My extracurriculars also went online and I no longer enjoyed them. That\\'s why there\\'s a gap for some of my activities during junior year because I quit them (such as jazz band). The comfort I once found at school was juxtaposed with the discomfort I found at home. My home environment was so disruptive that something as simple as therapy was not easily accessible due to my lack of privacy. I found myself doing my zoom therapy sessions in my car over the phone rather than in my own home. Because of junior year being terrible, it was really hard to study for the SAT or my AP exams. I was basically pulled out of school for 2 ish months. I had to do a lot of catching up at the start of senior year. I have been reassured that I will be much happier surrounded by lots of accepting people in college. Although I’m not sure where I’m going at all. I honestly might go to community college to save money, but I guess we’ll see. \\nThanks for reading this far if you did!', \"valedictorian only gets into her safety schools !! **academic & background information**\\n\\nGPA: 4.0 UW (school has weird weighted system, never got below a 94)\\n\\nrank: 1/300 public school (we usually get a few ivies a year, this year we had 1--dartmouth)\\n\\nSAT: 1510\\n\\nrace: asian (indian)\\n\\nimmigration note: on an h4 visa for 14 years (yay america!) so considered international for some schools and domestic for others. it's a mess.\\n\\nincome: 100k\\n\\nAPs: 11 (all 4s and 5s on exams, taking 5 senior year)\\n\\n* NOTE: currently taking AP research and doing a bunch of cool scientific research on my own rn\\n\\nmajor: public health or some equivalent\\n\\n* (NOTE: i feel like my ECs and awards kind of spoke to this major too?

It's important to note that much of this is guesswork because I wasn't on the admissions committee that made the decision - sometimes fully qualified applicants get rejected simply because someone similar but slightly more qualified or compelling got in instead. Sometimes there aren't glaring weaknesses that jump out, but there's almost always room for improvement.

More generic than my other one though.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nI interviewed for Reed, Lewis and Clark, and Georgetown.\\n\\n1. **Reed:** My best interview by far- we really connected and it was a very lighthearted conversation rather than an interview per se. I mentioned a bunch of reasons why I wanted to attend and we both talked about Reed's cheese club ahahah.\\n2. **Lewis and Clark:** went well, safety school so nothing crazy, more to learn about the school than anything\\n3. **Georgetown:** went okay. It was my first interview and I was very anxious (I also have general anxiety and social anxiety so it was a bit difficult :/ ). We both connected about our passion for the environment but otherwise, it was very interview like and she just asked questions straight from my resume :(\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI'm not even going to rate these because of how bad they were. My essays were probably some of the worst writing the admissions offices had ever read/seen.\\n\\n**Personal statement:** I wrote my common app essay on January 5th in two hours and never revised it or looked at it after that. I wrote about my fear of the unknown and how my time spent hiking and exploring off-trail helped me concur that fear in the context of debate. Very rushed, cliche themes, and way too much unnecessary descriptive language. My 8th-grade brother could have written a better essay if you would have given him time. If I could rate it, it would be (at minimum) a -5/10\\n\\n**Supplements:** Somehow even worse than my personal statement. I wrote ALL of my supplements the day of each college's deadline and some were written AFTER the deadline at 2:00 am - 4:00 am in the morning. Very cliche, rushed, and just obviously not a lot of care put into them (duh- I wrote them in the middle of the night after the deadline lmao).\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n\\\\*I applied to all my schools RD because I missed my early deadlines hahaha (oops- depression is a bitch)\\\\*\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Georgetown University (attending!!!)\\n* Middlebury College\\n* University of Oregon\\n* Lewis and Clark College\\n* Willamette University\\n* American University\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* George Washington University???

Some I turned in a couple of hours late, others days late, and some weeks late. I even submitted Georgetown and Middlebury late. I also wrote all of my supplements after the deadlines (except in the two cases mentioned above) and never edited any of my writing. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder back in November and really struggled throughout the application season. I didn't even start my applications until January and thought I would never get in anywhere. I was so happy to get into my safties and couldn't even imagine two months ago having choices of where to go.\\n\\nIf anything, this is proof that things work out eventually. If you would have told me back in my sleep-deprived writing sessions after MISSING my deadlines in January that I would be going to Georgetown, I would have laughed at you.\\n\\nFor any juniors or other high school students reading this- I hope things work out and wish you luck on your own college endeavors. As I mentioned in the beginning of my post, I can't believe I'm done with this process. Maybe I'm just overly sentimental, but it's very bittersweet and I'm excited to see where life takes me. Again, good luck to all of you high school juniors about to head into this process :) \\n\\nAll in all, I'm very happy with how things turned out. I wish I got into more selective liberal arts schools besides Middlebury since I much prefer that environment over a large school like Georgetown (and still feel an urge to go to Middlebury over Georgetown)- but I obviously didn't put in a lot of effort on my applications and deserve my rejections 100%. If anything, I wish I applied to more schools and obviously put more effort into writing essays. I was in a really low place in November and January though and I’m proud to have even made it to this point. \\n\\nI'm super excited and feel very privileged to be attending Georgetown though and D.C. is SUCH a dream for a pol sci/government major like me. Hopefully, the next four years treat me better than the last four.

The 32 act was a red flag for a lot of the schools I applied to and submitting could’ve hurt my application considering it’s below the median range for the majority of schools. Also, the 3 on bio was an ouch (Although I had As in all my hs bio classes)\\n\\n2. Don’t be afraid to brag a little.

Just for the theoretical knowledge and my own purposes.\\n\\n\\\\#6 - Both school and personal projects I built with LEGO like a windmeter, water pump and I honestly even threw in my DIY Beyblades because I wrote my CommonApp essay about them\\n\\n**Awards/Honors**\\n\\nIn terms of internal school awards, through 5-8th grade, I got awards for great overall academic performance but that was reserved for the top 3. Now, when it came to stuff I could actually put on my application, I fell off in the later years. Convenient.\\n\\nI got an award for best English student in 9th but I don\\'t think I even included that. 10-12th had no sorts of awards.\\n\\nOtherwise? Nada.\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation**\\n\\nCounselor (9/10) - Great guy, considering we don\\'t even have actual counselors. He was a math teacher I had for 2 years but he said he was somewhat familiar with commonApp and would be willing to help. Eloquent with his writing so while the content itself might not have been amazing, due to me, he probably put in a shift.\\n\\nEnglish Teacher (11/10) - Not only my English teacher, but the head of my school house. I used to fill in whenever we didn\\'t have members for anything and was always helpful to her. Was a pretty good English student as well. Evidently excellent in her writing so I had to ask.\\n\\nTechnical Drawing teacher(6/10) - People take T.D as a class to slack off and play computer games but I was interested in CAD and even physical sketching. I was probably one of the three people who took that class seriously. He isn\\'t a man of many words though but I still asked. I probably got a paragraph but anything was useful to me.\\n\\nPhysics teacher(8/10) - We had to make a rotating model of the Earth and it\\'s layers for a physics class in 9th grade. I brought mine to school and she begged me to keep it. That LEGO did not leave my collection without a price, because she had to write me this letter. Was one of the more active learners in her laid back class so she knew my character a bit.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nThe only one possible I believe was Northwestern and I opted the hell out of it because I was scared.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nCommonApp (8/10) - I\\'d like to think I\\'m a decent writer, well enough not to bore a reader anyways. Took me a while but I ended up writing about my love for beyblade. Yes, the spinning tops. Connected it with STEM. In hindsight that is kinda generic but in the moment, it felt revolution-ary :)\\n\\nIn my extended circumstances essay, I did mention how I wasn\\'t really my family\\'s main priority and that sorta made me shy away from extracurriculars. Life through most of school was just making sure my elder sibling got through education for their trade.\\n\\nSupplements were a mixed bag. Overall I put my best foot forward, but I was starting to feel pretty annoyed by this whole thing and some suffered more than others. I remember I was applying to TAMU and I did their 4 supplementals only to withdraw because they were giving me a headache with transcripts haha.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\nAcceptances:\\n\\nSUNY Buffalo EA (scholarship)\\n\\nVirginia Tech EA\\n\\nIowa State rolling (scholarship)\\n\\nColorado School of Mines (scholarship)\\n\\nUniversity of South Florida Rolling (scholarship)\\n\\nUMich EA (need based + scholarship) -> Committed!\\n\\nRPI (need based + scholarship)\\n\\nCase Western EA (scholarship)\\n\\nWaitlists:\\n\\nNorthwestern\\n\\nRejections:\\n\\nNortheastern deferred EA -> rejection\\n\\nRose Hulman EA\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nRight, gather around kiddos. By now you\\'ve realized something weird. Why did this person who was OOS everywhere apply to public schools? I was stupid basically. It\\'s a long story (life story alert) but, I never planned to go to college in the US - if go to college at all. I was a little depressed from how hectic life was in high school and never saw anything past secondary education. I never pushed myself to pick up any competitions like olympiads or more clubs. I only did what I liked.\\n\\nCovid happened, gave me time to think and then it so happened that my sibling would probably head off to the UK when I was finished with highschool. I could go to school there and they would get a higher salary. It would all work out. UK unis aren\\'t so heavy on ECs so I furthermore just did whatever I could to get by. Note that my mother actively discouraged me from college in the US... because ??? Overprotectiveness and ignorance.\\n\\nThat UK plan crumbled to bits in the middle of my final year of highschool when they failed a certification exam (being vague for privacy) and would be pushed back two years. It hit me that my choice was to stay in a country with a single university and mediocre living standards or take a gap year, and gap year I did. My mental health was in the trenches seeing all my classmates move on, domestically and internationally. My top choice was USF because of the proximity to the Caribbean and merit scholarships. I did the SATs over summer and surprised myself honestly. I was really happy, and thought I could definitely aim a little higher than USF. Then I started researching, stumbled upon chanceme and A2C. Commence further depression.\\n\\nI psyched myself out completely, comparing myself to the stats and ECs I saw. After doing well on the SAT, that really took the wind out of me. From there I did not comb through the finances side properly. I was just like, \"Right, it\\'s hopeless for me for those private schools. Best I can do is merit scholarships for decent T100 state schools\"\\n\\nEventually, and very late, the finances thing kinda dawned on me and I was panicking. My mom was on my tail about not aiming high (she was aiming a bit too high though... MIT?? come on ma) And thus Northeastern, Case Western and Northwestern were settled on. I could\\'ve taken a swing at an ivy but at that point, I didn\\'t think of myself enough for a T50 so y\\'know?\\n\\nHow did we end up on the lovely University of Michigan now? At the end of it all, my option was really Case at 8k a year. After aid UM was like 22k. The state schools merit aid didn\\'t shave off much of their cost otherwise (shocker, old me would\\'ve loved to know) I talked to my family and everyone was very much against Cleveland and they would rather me to go local Uni here. No way. So I was distraught and realizing my errors, not applying to more private schools. It was over for me, with NU waitlist chance very slim. I\\'d have to probably physically fight my mother for that to happen and run away from home - yeah that wouldn\\'t be good. (do not inquire, just accept)\\n\\nSo I was crying my eyes out one night, and the next morning the College of Engineering at UM gave me a 20k scholarship on top of everything else! Typing this now, it hasn\\'t even properly sunk in. Those scholarships were given out on the 15th of April, and it seems some people rejected it and one just happened to fall to me on the 27th I believe.\\n\\nSo that\\'s that. It\\'s been a long post, but I haven\\'t really been able to share my struggles with anyone who understood application and whatnot. My hooks probably did help me but, to any of you reading this, I know how frustrating it is to feel inferior to others. In fact even now, I\\'ve seen some of my future classmates talking about reallllly amazing things I can\\'t even grasp. I\\'ve my own road ahead of me though and going forward, I\\'ll take the experience from applications and make sure I don\\'t get anchored down by these feelings of being less.\\n\\nRealism is one thing but you really miss 100% of the shots you don\\'t take.\\n\\nIt\\'s better to cry, to feel frustrated, to feel like a loser rather than not try at all. That\\'s something I really didn\\'t do properly. I also was a little goofy and could\\'ve applied to LACs and higher acceptance rate privates but tell that to my prestige chasing mom. I was also lucky, that people with scholarships declined their offer. It happened to work out for me, but it\\'s definitely not common. This whole application thing is more stressful than it should be, and if I were raised with knowledge of this system, I\\'d definitely crumble - I completely fell apart a good few times while making my school list, and during my gap year in general.\\n\\nEven if you fall apart, or don\\'t feel good enough, keep your heads up! Your progress might be achingly slow or your future might seem as bright as a badly burnt toast but just keep moving forward. Reaching out your hands to something that doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s for you feels wrong, and you might not have any faith that it would fall to you, but reach still.

I think the biggest thing that helped him in his application was a very steady upward trend - every single semester he improved his GPA, even making the honor roll the last two semesters (I know a 3.5 isn’t impressive for this sub, but he came a long way). I think another big positive in his application is his genuineness. He never did any activities for the sake of his application, and he’s super passionate about astrophysics and learning in general. Northwestern has always been his dream school, and since none of the other schools he applied to have ED he just figured he would apply ED there.

Emory was prob my #1 school and I probably would\\'ve committed here, so they did me so dirty even though my essays weren\\'t that good looking back. 🙄 Did join the waitlist bc I am a simp for Emory.!<\\n\\n\\\\-March 26, *George Washington*: >!ACCEPTED. Kinda had this decision spoiled since they emailed me saying \"Congrats on being accepted! Here\\'s how to access your financial aid!\", but cool ig!!<\\n\\n\\\\-March 26, *Northwestern*: >!ACCEPTED. HOLY F\\\\*CK. After getting waitlisted at Emory I thought my chances were 0%, especially with their 7%ish RD acceptance rate, but I was completely wrong I guess. College admissions really can be unpredictable. Wow. Life=changed.!<\\n\\n\\\\-March 29, *Vanderbilt*: >!WAITLISTED. The major I wanted to study at Vandy is really similar to the one I got accepted to at Northwestern, so I wasn\\'t too upset, but I did join the waitlist. !<\\n\\n\\\\-March 30, *USC*: >!ACCEPTED. I don\\'t think USC would be a great fit for me, but it\\'s super cool to get accepted to a school celebrities pay thousands of dollars to get into and I\\'ll definitely be considering it!!<\\n\\n\\\\-March 31, *NYU:* >!ACCEPTED. Fun story: Penn and NYU\\'s apps were due the same day, so ofc, I decided to apply to Penn the night of. I ended up finishing my Penn app early and decided to go for NYU with like 2 hours left until the deadline. I love NYU, but after seeing the watermelon salads and the price they expect me to pay, I\\'m not so sure about it...😭!<\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**IVY DAY (This is about to get really depressing, I can already feel it....)**\\n\\n\\\\-April 6, *Yale*:>!

Your loss 🙄!<\\n\\n\\\\-April 6, *Cornell*: >!WAITLISTED. WHOA! A non-rejection on Ivy Day! Their waitlist letter was super reaffirming too, but I\\'ll probably go with Northwestern at this point. Thanks for the validation though Cornell, you\\'re a real one <3!<\\n\\n\\\\-April 6, *UPenn (Wharton)*: >!REJECTED.

What a year and what an experience! I can\\'t believe I was going through depression last year at this time after realizing I was officially rejected from my (then) dream school of UT Austin. Although not everything went my way, I think taking a gap year was such a fulfilling and well needed time of my life that I 100% don\\'t regret. !<\\n\\nRejection Thoughts: >!This is 100% just me grasping at straws, but I feel like I didn\\'t pass the academic threshold at a lot of schools purely bc of my MANY B\\'s I had in HS, including a low B in economics (which I planned on majoring in). Still, the fact that some schools saw beyond that is extremely validating and makes me realize how holistic the whole process is.!<\\n\\nDecision: >!Although I am on the waitlist for Emory, Vanderbilt, and Cornell, I will most likely go with Northwestern even if they take me off bc Northwestern is an amazing school, but I\\'ll probably post a waitlist update at some point! Overall, I\\'m so humbled and thankful for my college application season. !<\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks so much for reading! :) Congrats to everyone that went through the application process this year and good luck to anyone applying in the future!

Who knows\", 'Low-income, home-schooled, gap-year Asian-American boi gets destroyed. (But not really) I\\'m hooked. Low-income and Ivy legacy. It might seem like a strange combo, but Ivy League degrees can only do so much to protect you from bad decisions. Kids, remember that it doesn\\'t matter how much money you make if every dollar that comes in goes right back out.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\'s my profile:\\n\\n**Demographics:** Low-income (EFC is 0), male, East Asian, US Citizen living abroad. Gap year. One of my parents went to Middlebury before transferring to an Ivy (to my knowledge, this kind of \"half-legacy\" does nothing). They\\'re a non-donor.\\n\\n**Stats:** 1540 SAT (no writing), 800 Math II, 680 Biology, three AP 5s (computer science A, microecon, and macroecon). Two upcoming APs. GED, no GPA.\\n\\n**Extracurricular Activities:** Music production for 5-6 years, produced a song with 100k+ views. Gold medal at a small regional competition in a niche sport. Started writing a web-novel in late Nov 2019 that now has 100k+ views and 700+ followers (this one and the next weren\\'t in my EA and RD applications. They were included in my LOCIs and my super-late apps). Edited the fan translations of three web novels for a year (worked on 100+ chapters).\\n\\n**Essays:** Okay. Neither tear-jerking nor funny. Probably above-average. I wrote about music production and what it taught me about dedication and discipline.\\n\\n**Recommendation Letters**: Nothing special. Got two from core-subject tutors.\\n\\n**Misc. Notes**: For the most part, I applied with economics as my first-choice major and computer science as my second choice. For a few schools, I applied with philosophy as my second-choice major because I\\'m an indecisive dolt with a vague interest in law. This doesn\\'t seem to have affected my results.\\n\\n**Results**:\\n\\n* Yale University (SCEA) \\\\[Rejected in the early round, no deferral\\\\]\\n* University of Virginia (EA) \\\\[Rejected\\\\]\\n* Wesleyan University (RD) \\\\[Rejected\\\\]\\n* Boston University (RD) \\\\[Rejected\\\\]\\n* Connecticut College (RD) \\\\[Waitlisted\\\\]\\n* Colby College (RD) \\\\[Waitlisted\\\\]\\n* Lafayette College (RD) \\\\[Waitlisted\\\\]\\n* Vassar College (RD) \\\\[Waitlisted\\\\]\\n* Middlebury College (RD) \\\\[Waitlisted\\\\]\\n\\nYes, it was depressing.

I could afford St Olaf. With a subsidized loan, it would be 4k a year for me. Astonishing. Earth-shattering.\\n\\nI was ready to go. In my mind, I was already in Minnesota. I was already in Northfield. I was already a student at St. Olaf, eating a cookie and studying economics and Russian to meet the goddamn foreign language requirement, ducking the language profs with shitty ratemyprofessor ratings.\\n\\nAs for my LOCIs, I wrote one. Yes, I wrote one and used it for all four schools I sent my LOCI to (ConnCollege didn\\'t get a LOCI: I was lazy and had no hope for my waitlists). The only difference was that for Middlebury, I said I\\'d go for sure if I were accepted. I sent the LOCIs in the last week of April.\\n\\nThen two days ago, I got an email. A Middlebury admissions officer wanted to have a \"15-minute Q&A session.\" Really, what the fuck is that? Is it just code for \"we\\'re gonna call u w/ an acceptance and we want ur verbal guarantee boi\"? Or do they just want to keep stringing me along?\\n\\nI signed up for the Q&A. I did it today. The AO asked \"where I was\" in the college app process. I picked up the hint and said I was committed to another college but would absolutely go to Midd if I were accepted.\\n\\n\"Congratulations,\" he said. I was accepted. My financial aid letter would come in by Wednesday at the latest.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI thought I knew what it was like to be on a \"roller-coaster of emotions\" before. This is on another level. Fuck you college admissions.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m not off the roller-coaster yet. If Midd drops a 74k price tag on me, I\\'ll really become a Russian-speaking, cookie-eating, shitty-prof-ducking boi at St. Olaf. But until Wednesday comes, I\\'m celebrating that acceptance.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: I got awesome financial aid.

I talked about my experience with cancer and the highlighted the treatment and affects on my family.

Faculty is one of the most unique aspect a university can have and often university like to show off the professor they do have. Bc I am an URM I specially talked about URM professor I wanted to meet do to my interest within tech and gaining their experience on how to handle barriers.  \\n\\nUIUC: They were so short. And for what limited word space I did have I talked about how competing at a local hackathon inspired me to be interested within UX and UI. \\n\\nUW Seattle: This was a cultural essay and honestly, It was just as good as my common app. It had the right amount of setback but made sure to make it about what I don’t to overcome them.

However with most OOS wanting 50k additional compared to my instate school (which is still amazing school) It made no sense. I think applying to only 6 colleges helped me focus much more on the supplemental and actually research what the university offered. Im really happy how my admission turned out and how lucky I got with my dream school!

I had undiagnosed ADHD until October 2021 which explained a lot but I did not mention it in any app because my mom said no. I am an insane perfectionist and would not be happy unless every single decision was an acceptance but I'm happy with the options I have.

I spent relatively 8-10 hours in total perfecting it. Briefly hooked the reader by mentioning my wide family lineage (grandpa had 132 kids, I’m a child from a polygamous family). I intertwined this fact with the bullying I received in middle school and high school due to my background and my good grades. Ended up with the success story of creating a zero-tolerance bullying policy in my school, IG page against social anxiety, and being willing to help anyone that comes my way.\\n* Supplemental essays (8.5/10): I think that on average I was very creative with my responses and always found a way to incorporate a new/different aspect of my character in each essay.\\n\\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\\n\\nAcceptances :\\n\\n* UC Berkeley (no aid since I’m intl) (RD)\\n* The Wharton School at Penn (full tuition aid) (RD)\\n* Columbia (received a likely so I knew I had high chances of admission, John jay scholar, 43k aid per year but 53k still left to pay) (RD)\\n* University of Miami (full tuition aid + foote fellows honors) (RD)\\n* University of Denver (42k per year) (RD)\\n* Seattle University (30.5k per year + honors) (RD)\\n* Temple University (21.5k per year + honors) (EA)\\n\\nsidenote: my scolarships amounted to a total of $1.1 million and long story short my new name at school is now \"Miss Ivy League\" haha.\\n\\nWaitlists:\\n\\n* Hamilton College (RD)\\n* Oberlin College (RD)\\n\\nRejections:\\n\\n* St. Olaf (RD)\\n* Harvard (deferred REA then rejected)\\n* Yale (RD)\\n* Cornell (RD)Dartmouth (RD)\\n* Stanford (RD)\\n* Northeastern (RD)\\n* Northwestern (RD)\\n* BU (RD)\\n* Vanderbilt (RD)\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n\\n* I would recommend using Collegevine to review your essays.

Anyways best of luck to the class of 2028.\\n* The journey will be excruciating and demanding but please have an appropriate amount of safeties, targets, and reaches to finish this journey with at least one uni.\\n* My SAT score wasn’t that great but I still managed to land 2 ivies (and a likely) so I would really emphasize on being well-rounded and having a pertaining story.

I felt like a failure, was always tired, and my mom was dealing with breast cancer (don't worry, she's beat it!). The only school I mentioned this to was UC Berkeley, but it wasn't for an excuse for my drop in grades but for the possibility I may need more financial aid in the future. \\n\\nThe most frustrating part is how opaque and shady it is. Most people, even consultants, have no idea how it all works unless they worked inside the admissions office. I know someone who was top 6% of their class that was rejected from UT Austin computer science yet got into UMich and CMU for computer science, (he's going to CMU, yet his family has to pay $70k a year). I know someone who had practically nonexistent comp sci ecs, who got a 2 on the AP CS exam, and who was know to cheat who got into UT Austin computer science and Northwestern pre-med, while someone I know who's basically a musical god and did a medical internship was rejected from Northwestern pre-med. The only person I know who got into Stanford was someone who got recruited to play softball their junior year. I know people who've won international Olympiads and other prestigious awards who've actually worked hard and were passionate about what they studied and they deserve all their success. And yet, I see others who seem to game and cheat the system. \\n\\nPaid college consultants, sports recruitment, lying, cheating...these circumvent meritocracy and undermine American education.\\n\\nHowever, just because you didn't get into a big name school doesn't mean everything's over. People say that graduate school is really all that matters. Yes, top tier schools are usually generous with financial aid, but so are some lesser known ones, especially UTD. I know people who got into schools like John Hopkins who chose UTD instead. \\n\\nJust know that opportunity lies everywhere. You simply have to look hard enough. Many things in life are out of your control and horrible things can strike from nowhere. Don't take these things personally since, ultimately, they're due to chance. Just focus on powering through and trying your luck again. By the Law of Large Numbers (thanks AP Stats) you'll find success.\\n\\nEdit: I actually have a $3k stipend per semester not $6k.

ACT of 29, sends some kids to USC/Notre Dame/UC’s etc. every year) then had to move from NV back to the PNW and the combination of having no friends or social life and constant fighting with my father plus (especially) the impacts of COVID/online learning gave me severe depression and social anxiety which led me to giving up entirely on school and resigning myself to the idea of having to live with my dad for another 2 years going to CC  - not that there is anything wrong with CC, it was just the least preferable option in my scenario. I had no idea I could even get into a 4 year college still til September 2021, which lead to me spending all day on Niche and A2C every day finding any school I thought may take me and hitting SAT prep relatively hard (3~ hours a day every day for a month straight). I was supposed to take the November SAT but got sick the night before leaving me with no choice but to cancel. I shotgun as hard as I did because I had no clue what I was doing and I was trying to make up for what seemed like 2 years of missed prep work. It wasn’t terrible in terms of stress (except for doing like 7 supps and my final draft of my personal essay along with submitting 35 applications the night of Jan. 15th) and I don’t necessarily regret it (at least for the learning experience it gave me with properly researching things and organizing lists - plus sending out a bunch of apps is lowkey kinda fun lol) but I definitely wouldn’t recommend doing it unless you’re someone who needs very high to full ride levels of aid or some other edge case along those lines. I hope this post can at least be a fun side piece to the innumerable amounts of X person at highly competitive Bay Area/NY public school with 3.8 and a 1520 gets into 3 T20’s for CS. I'm happy with ASU since the weather should help a good amount with my depression, the amount of stuff to do being right next to Phoenix, and them having the #2 ranked SCM program in the country.

My college decisions drove me through a roller coaster of underwhelming events and, of course, unexpected change of matters that shined a light to eject happy electrons off my rusted surface of emotions (AP Physics 2 gang).\\n\\nI am so grateful to have ended up with CMU. My advice for students from the first-generation community and all rising applicants, regardless of their background, is to not expect a “miracle acceptance - **I never expected one from any of my reaches**. Long-time A2C lurkers and I have witnessed the bloodbath that surfaced in the past months: Perfect stats rejected at targets, cracked applicants going 0/x on Ivy Day, and internet influencers with millions of followers gone without a T20. The systemic flaws existing in this rat race, including and not limited to the subjective evaluations of candidacy, institutional needs, funding & building donors, legacy status, nepotism, and more than people usually expect, **luck**, are all culprits leading to these disheartened outcomes. I know so many hardworking and intelligent kids at my school who got unideal results - and that’s none of their faults.\\n\\n[IvyHub](https://ivyhub.org/rejection-simulators/) didn’t have a rejection simulator for CMU, but I would’ve been A-okay if I did get rejected. The general attitude of approaching this monstrosity with nonchalant anticipations was the best thing ever that happened to my near-crippling mental health. When I cried over my Michigan deferral (not even a crappy rejection, I overreacted 🤡), that single event ruined my entire day’s mood and exacerbated my procrastination, leading to the miserable six hours that followed my depressed waking hours. All of that atrocity was preventable with just a slight change in expectations and if I had found better ways to deal with this not-so-pleasant news. I do not encourage the suppression of positivity. In fact, please embrace and celebrate the good things in life with your family, loved ones, and friends! But when things are not certain to happen, it is crucial to withhold expectations. I hope you all could take my words and journey as a lesson.

I had already previously dealt with depression, and with the added stress I experienced frequent panic attacks. It got so bad that I wasn't able to leave my house without having an anxiety attack and I accrued many absences in freshman year. COVID and online school honestly saved me (who knew taking a person afraid of people away from the people would ease their anxiety lol). I was diagnosed with a Social Anxiety Disorder and was privledged enough to get therapy and medication during sophmore year, I started making friends in junior year, and by senior year I was functioning as a relatively normal human being.\\n\\nHowever, due to my mental health issues, my extra curriculars and letters of recommendations definitely lacked. I didn't talk about what I went through in my application because, one, I was worried about bias and, two, it's none of their business. Due to my disorder, rejections already cause a lot of anxiety (because I worry that other people don't like me like the admission officers) and I knew that if I put something that personal in my application and then got rejected (which was likely because I was applying to highly rejective schools), I would likely freak out. I was originally disappointed with my results (although they were expected), however no tears were shed. After visiting, UCSD and University of Washington (I had already visited the other schools), the choice was obvious to me. The University of Washington felt so right to me and I'm so excited to attend there in the fall. I also have won two scholarships (one national and one local) since my decision, and gotten a high paying summer internship that I'm really excited about!

His LORs are known for not being the best in general, but this is definitely the academic rec.\\n\\nMUN Coach and AP Psychology Teacher (9/10): Getting this teacher to do my LOR was unique because she talked not only from a class, academic standpoint but was also able to talk about my leadership as president of the club. I only had her senior year, so she had very little to write about but I gave her some points to talk about and in combination with the MUN experience, I think she was able to cover my personality and much more of my true self than the previous teacher could.\\n\\nCounselor (10/10): I gave my counselor almost 10 pages worth of information about myself to use when writing the rec. If this LOR wasn't perfect, I don't know what could be.

I’m in Orchestra 😔\\n\\n**AP Chemistry Teacher: 7/10** Such a sweet teacher. Though I was a student the first year she taught the AP Chem course and she had no idea what she was doing.

Still kind of sad since I don’t like sharing my personal statement and they were the only person I shared it with… but I talked about my interests and passions for science. Hook was on a pet rock I shared to my first grade class. Carried it over to how I got involved in the things I got involved in. Then to COVID and my father passing away from liver cancer so suddenly. And how I want to utilize that experience towards helping those who can’t afford medical treatments and finding vaccines. Overall IMO **6.5/10**\\n\\n**QB Topical Essay** **describe an experience that caused you to change your perspective and/or opinion** : Talked about my friend and me realizing I imposed my views on her when she was feeling depressed. “Not only did I understand how to support her through her recovery, but also reflected and corrected myself on the times I viewed individuals with my burdensome ideas of them and not their own.” Then connected this to the relationship with my mother.

Start your apps **early** or you run the risk of ruining your best chance.\\n\\nI\\'m an advocate for shotgunning. I disagree strongly with people who say having more applications means you spread your time too thin and have lower quality apps. Barely heard of Duke at the time, only applied because it was high on the rankings. \\n\\nI believe essays (other than personal statement) are less important than your major/what \"new thing\" you will bring to the school. For Caltech and MIT your essays matter even less and your awards and achievements are above all.\\n\\nFrom the collective experiences of my friends, volunteering really doesn\\'t help college admissions, and you should volunteer only for things you genuinely enjoy. Leadership is not necessarily important, but a clear drive and dedication towards a passion is.\\n\\nAlso, **CS is tough.**\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:**\\n\\nI honestly believed that violin was a major part to my application, however I got flat rejected from, well, every school that had an arts supplement other than Duke. Personally, I believe the best to worst parts of my application was extracurriculars, essays, honors, arts portfolio, rec letters.

They saw my video about 3 times I think! It was unlisted, so I\\'m not sure why the video was gaining views...\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nAh yes, the part you\\'re waiting for! I embraced my failures head-on. I know people encourage to write about trauma and sob stories and whatnot but I don\\'t think it\\'s healthy. I would also suggest that writing very abstract, flowery essays isn\\'t always the best move either. My personal statement was the least poetic, as I just talked about how I\\'ve felt throughout my life. I talked about monotony and how I\\'ve lost myself through all the continuous obstacles thrown my way. Sometimes after going through so much, you don\\'t see a reason to keep pushing. If life will continue to repeat, what am I doing here? Yet, a majority of my essay talked about what I wanted to do about it and my dreams for the future. I talked about my appeal for multiculturalism, plus why I was attracted to cultural studies and languages. All I\\'ve wanted is to embrace my individualism and be free to do what I want and looking back, I think I accomplished that in my high school career and before. I would consider myself a unique person, so I capitalized on the aspects that contributed to that. Everything I do, I can\\'t explain. But, I don\\'t want to end up like the people i\\'ve seen around me. \\n \\nAs for my UChicago supplements, my \"Why\" essay and Uncommon essay were my favorites to write about. I wrote about the Futurama main characters as a group of three, plus tied it back to me. My \"Why\" essay was extremely specific, and I\\'ve talked to the AOs at UChicago through meetings before so I\\'m sure they recognized some aspects I mentioned.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* *Only applied ED to UChicago!*\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* *N/A*\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* *QuestBridge (Not sure if this counts)*   \\n\\nWithdrew from Oberlin, Bowdoin, Middlebury, Colby, Emory, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, State Schools, Brown, Princeton, etc.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nI was very depressed after my QuestBridge rejection. I had applied for NCM and CPS, but knowing that I couldn\\'t get in made me question if I was even considered high-achieving. If I\\'m not good enough for QuestBridge, why should I believe I have a chance at any of these top schools? Right after, I put all my frustration into my writing. I applied ED2 instead of ED because I wanted them to see my midyear report\\'s upward trend, plus I needed time to perfect my essays. I also talked about my project, plus the extraneous circumstances I had during my sophomore year to explain my dip in grades.\\n\\nSome things to note, yes I\\'ve had my fair share of unfortunate life events. My mom left me, I was homeless periodically throughout my life, and I\\'ve been a full-time caretaker of my family for years (all of which have prolonged conditions and special needs). However, please don\\'t judge me based on this small profile. I posted this to let you know that you can do it, there is hope. And, I know how nervous a lot of people are about their results who are in my same position. I would reach out to advisors only to get rejected (WilliamTheReader\\'s Pro-Bono, essay reading services, fly-ins, etc.). I realized through this whole process that I didn\\'t love myself. Anyone could see a mile away that I would apply to them and not put in my best effort. The greatness was in me all along, and I needed to trust myself. I had to stop feeling like I was useless. I\\'m not great at that now either, but the acceptance to my dream school helped me realize that I needed to change my self-perception. There would be so many great things I\\'d miss out on in life just because I didn\\'t give myself the opportunity. I\\'d give up before I began, and anyone who knows me would tell you I would constantly say \"I\\'m getting rejected\" from every school I put down. Put your heart out there, try even harder than everyone else, and see what happens. I can\\'t guarantee that you\\'ll get everything you want but prove to yourself that you can do better. All my rejections (14+ fly-in rejects and QB) made me realize I can be so much better. Embrace what makes you unique, and realize that you\\'re all so much more. I think it\\'s fair to say I defied all odds. Now, I look back and I couldn\\'t be prouder of myself. I met the most amazing people, and I can proudly look at my work and say it was all mine.

A lot of the people on here had great relationships with their counselors, which seems very bizarre to me, coming from a large public high school. I just never talked to the guy unless I needed him. Probably not good advice. But, he was present at my GIEP (Gifted meeting) for all three years, and each time he told my mom I was one of the brightest, hard-working, motivated students he's ever worked with. So he was probably going off my transcript, extracurriculars, work status, and GIEP meetings. \\n\\nAP Lang Teacher: 10/10. Had a 100 and participated often in class. She is also the advisor to the club I founded. She was also one of the only people who were there for me last year when I was having a pretty bad depressive episode. She's probably the only teacher I would ever be comfortable discussing anything like that with. We've also had conversations about my ambivalence towards STEM and my fears about having to pursue it instead of my real passion (my parents basically said I could major in English only if I got into an Ivy LOL), so when she found out I got into Princeton and was majoring in English she was so happy she cried. I love her so much, definitely best teacher relationship I've ever had.\\n\\nAP Stat Teacher: 6-7/10?? Had a 100 in class, participated semi-regularly. Honestly, I only asked for a rec from her because at the time, I still had that STEM pressure from my parents, and it's a good idea to ask at least one math/science teacher if you want to major in a STEM-related field. She's a super nice teacher and person and definitely liked me a lot as a student, but I never really had a strong personal connection. If I could do it again, I might have asked another teacher. \\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nAs a policy, Princeton never gives interviews to Questbridge applicants. I did, however, also rank Yale, Columbia, and Penn (in that order, Princeton was first). I got an interview for Yale and Penn- if you would like to hear about that experience, I can elaborate in the replies.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nQuestbridge Essays: For Questbridge, you're allowed two essays. One on challenges you have faced, one on something that sparks your intellectual curiosity. I wrote the first one basically about my life story. Definitely very personal and vulnerable. It wasn't really a normal personal narrative that shows growth from a specific event- more an exploration of my familial background and Asian-American roots and how it ties into my passion for English. The second one was about my interest in female authors. I definitely think Questbridge allows you to tell your story and craft a narrative about yourself. Although I definitely cringed writing them, I'm personally very proud of my main essays, and I think they showcase my story very well.\\n\\nAdditional Info: Questbridge also allowed additional writing for special financial, academic, or social circumstances over the pandemic. I wrote about how my mom lost her job over the pandemic, reducing our income to zero and putting us in substantial student loan debt (she reentered school to become a nurse). Because of this, my older sister, who's a senior at college also on Questbridge, has been footing a lot of our household bills while not even living with us anymore.\\n\\nPrinceton Supplements: I BSed so hard. Just absolute, complete, utter BS. Like submit at 11:59 PM levels of BS. To be fair, the Princeton supplements are absolutely ridiculous in number and question type. \\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\nPrinceton Questbridge Match!!- Binding decision, I have already committed to Princeton Class of 2026! It feels surreal to be done the college application process so early.\\n\\n*Waitlists:* \\n\\nN/A\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\nN/A\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nI definitely didn't have anything that made me stand out by leaps and bounds. I think I've just always been committed to a few things that I actually care about, which allowed me to get a few leadership roles. I also think that because I applied through Questbridge, I looked a lot better academically due to my family's financial situation and my work commitments. Personal speculation- I think I got in solely because of my essays and my high academic achievement in relation to my finances, which sort of makes me feel like I'm cheating because I had access to so many resources from my well-funded public high school in a pretty wealthy area.\\n\\nI still oscillate between feeling extremely lucky, extremely undeserving, and extremely anxious for the future. Ultimately, though, I'm admitted and committed, so there's really no use in dwelling on it. I believe that the ability and dedication that have carried me through high school will apply to college and my career, regardless of the direction my future takes.

I then wrote about how although I never wanted an antagonist, cancer wrote itself into my life and ultimately became it, taking my mother away from me.

I think the right answer is just to put what you need, to help AOs get a clearer picture on who you are fully.

A lot of the stuff I did was leadership based, and it wasn’t really able to be quantified--the rec letters helped back up the amount of effort and time I had put into these activities, and I think they really helped my personality shine through my application.\\n\\nCS Teacher (9/10): I had him my freshman and sophomore years of high school–super duper engaged in his class, he really helped catapult me to start some independent projects, and kept in touch later w/ a few more independent CS projects. Probably my favorite teacher that I’ve had throughout HS.\\n\\nEnglish Teacher (6/10): I’m not sure--I had heard he gives good recs, but only had him for one semester in AP Lang. I asked a lot of questions in class and talked to him a lot independently about writing and writing styles in general, out of class. I had a really weird writing phase my junior year of HS? Like a ton of purple prose, and weird emotional stuff? I think I was basically emo in 11th grade.\\n\\nMusic Teacher (8/10): I had been volunteering to play with his school ensembles since I was a freshman. He knows about my practice schedule and how big of a part music plays in my life (since I stayed every day after school to practice), and he knows me as a person pretty well.\\n\\nCoach (9/10): He’s definitely seen the best side of me, and has seen my enthusiasm for fencing. Really looked up to him as a coach and friend–has been there through 4 years of HS, and has seen me grow from a super quiet freshman to who I am now.\\n\\n**Common App Essay (9/10):**\\n\\nIt was  a stream-of-consciousness essay–super romantic-era in style, talking about how this one moment fencing helped me stop seeing people as competition, but more as friends and others who shared my passion. Unlike a lot of the other styles I had seen online, I didn’t just do an anecdote as a hook, and then go into like retrospective thinking--I just stayed in the anecdote for the entire essay. It felt really risky, because I knew for sure I didn’t talk about my application as much as I should have--but it went really in depth to one part of my personality. Basically, the essay was 100% depth, 0% breadth.\\n\\nI was also very hesitant on this topic because I felt that the initial part of the essay (talking about how I saw others as competition) was really negative. However, I think it really showcased growth well, and touched on an important part of my personality--connecting and interacting with others.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nMIT (0/10): SO BAD. This was my first interview as well and it was a pretty jarring experience. I kept answering questions, and he kept saying like. “No … that wasn’t the answer I was looking for … try again?” After that, I started talking about my CS projects, and he just absolutely drilled me. I talked about the algorithms I implemented in some of my projects, so on and so forth, and he kept quizzing me. I literally went back and studied my old projects again after this interview so I would be ready for the other interviewers?? (thankfully no one else quizzed me on the technicalities of my old projects again).\\n\\nWe had take a brief walk after, and talked about the weather for a while, so it also maybe made up for it? 😀\\n\\nHarvard (4/10): Pretty mid. The student actually went to the same school I did, but we didn’t really connect on many fronts.\\n\\nYale (5/10): Pretty mid, but better than Harvard? It was just a typical interview, typical questions, and really straightforward.\\n\\nStanford (8/10): Good! My interviewer had actually seen some of my piano performances before! She was a super duper interesting person, and I really enjoyed talking to her.\\n\\nPrinceton (11/10): SO GOOD. My interviewer and I actually talked for 3-4 hours over Zoom, and just talked about really random experiences and times we had in our lives. We went like really in-depth about ourselves, and honestly, I think I connected with her more than I have with some of my friends. Super duper duper duper positive experience. Still in contact with my interviewer now!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**I applied to everything as a CS major (some under the arts college instead of the engineering college).**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**EA:**\\n\\nUT Austin (OOS): >!REJECTED. !<\\n\\nUIUC: >!REJECTED.

I had gotten into GT already, so if all didn’t work out, I would still be able to go there (but I really really really didn’t like the GT campus and the Southern weather…). I knew that it shouldn’t account too much into how one views where they’re going, but I guess I didn’t love the vibe there? I loved their THREADS curriculum though, so I was looking forward to it academically (for prospective GT applicants, I would recommend looking into this program)! I was really looking forward to a few schools. For Brown, I thought I would have a bit better than slim chance, since I submitted a video portfolio that I was personally super proud of. For Princeton, I was really hoping my interview would help carry through. For Yale, I was just praying.\\n\\nHarvard: >!Rejected.

I think my biggest mistake was making college apps my life--I really didn't talk to my friends much, and didn't really confide in anyone about my mental health. If I were to do it again, I'd definitely try to pace myself a bit more, and make it more sustainable.\\n\\nOverall, there’s a few things that I think helped my application stand out. I think the first was my common app essay. It was a super risky essay though--I really took in the advice to show not tell, which is why I made it a stream-of-consciousness essay. Up till I submitted my application, I kept questioning the validity of the essay, and if it told enough about me and who I was to the AOs. At the end of EA, I yoloed it though? After more reflection for the RD round, I realized that this essay was pretty good–it helped demonstrate more about my personality than if I were to directly comment on it (like how all the “JHU Essays that Worked” essays go). In retrospect, I would say to not be afraid to take risks. I would use my essays to show my personality, not the personality of the another essay I saw online. I think that everyone has different writing styles–there aren’t good and bad styles. There are just different styles.\\n\\nSecond, I organized my activity list in more of a category-grouping sort of way instead of how much time I spent on it, or how impressive I thought it sounded. So overall, it came out to be like\\n\\n(1-2) Piano\\n\\n(3-5) Fencing-related\\n\\n(6-10) More leadership\\n\\nOrganizing it like this helped me find out the main themes that I wanted in my application. For my activity list, I think including digital media production was sort of a unique thing? It definitely didn’t really fit the gradient of the other activities listed. However, it was an activity that meant a lot to me, and so I included it. I personally think that it doesn't matter how impressive an activity is or how much time you spent--if it means a lot, I would put it in! Like, there are a few CS/DS related internships that I had done over the years that I opted out of including, because they didn't really have much of a personal impact on me, and grow my character. They would have most likely shown I was more qualified for CS , but I felt as it just didn't fit who I was as much as the other activities did. Finally, a few more comments.\\n\\n* I really don’t think those big corporation college counselors are worth it. They not only try to manufacture “passion” in your application, but their practices are just pretty ethically questionable in general. They are kinda scams too, for the price they’re worth. I would talk to someone I trust,  close friends and teachers--they'll provide invaluable insight compared to some strangers that you hire!\\n* I did a lot of self reflection! College apps was really about discovering who I am. I had to take a lot of time to figure out why I want to do what I want to do, and put my story on paper. It's very hard to put the human experience into words, which is why I think college apps is so hard sometimes.\\n* I think AOs really do care about personality and initiative. Initiative is one of the biggest things I think that make applications stand out. If you see something in your community that needs fixing, take that initiative, no matter how big or how small. Genuine effort shows in your community as well as in an application.\\n\\nI spent a lot of time on this subreddit while I was applying, and after seeing so many applications, my biggest anxiety was not having a huge huge spike in STEM (no RSI, no ISEF). Uploading this application, I wanted to just show people applying that you don't need to always have a huge spike in some certain area--just be yourself, and you'll do good!\", 'unconfident rich-ish white girl who tests well applies too many places and gets into a lot of them EDIT: I had some suss experiences sharing essays so probably not doing that anymore unless you can prove your identity to me and have some compelling reason why you\\'d want to see them.

That being said I started as one of the worst on the team and now am one of the best, so that can\\'t have hurt.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nI did thirteen, I got into every school I interviewed for except Yale (and WL at Harvard/Pomona). Generally they went well, my MIT one I thought was rocky but the interviewer called me when I got in and said he really enjoyed our conversation. I think a few of them I could tell right away they were good, but other than that some of the ones I thought were good weren\\'t, and some I thought flopped didn\\'t (for instance, my Pomona interview was TERRIBLE, and I still got waitlisted).\\n\\nI think generally I interviewed well, if anything I came across overly enthusiastic as to be fake (that\\'s kind of my personality...very high strung/excitable). I didn\\'t really prepare too much for any of them except writing specific questions, and that helped me stress less, though this was definitely the most stressful part of the process for me.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\\n\\nUh? I think that my essays were generally quite strong. My personal statement I spent like three months writing and rewriting it, it was about the intersection of two of my interests and how it has taught me to want to make a difference in the world using new and creative methods. I would have said it was too academic (and not emotional enough) but one of my AOs emailed when I got in and said he loved it, so I guess that\\'s worth something.\\n\\nI am a super slow writer so each essay took me around 2 hours to draft, 2 to edit. I think I had about 60 in total including scholarship ones. I had a strict schedule that I really tried to stay on, much of my best writing was done when I was drop dead tired, and I spent my ENTIRE Thanksgiving break writing (which was great bc I finished then).\\n\\nI only had my school counselor and my dad read most of them, I think this helped a lot because it meant that my voice really shined though. I also got to be really good at the copy-paste especially for the \"Why-us\" essays - definitely recommend doing that if you can pull it off.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Cal (I got in early for Regents, didn\\'t get it) - match\\n* UCLA (got invited to Regents, didn\\'t get it) - match\\n* UCSD (Regents) - safety\\n* UC Davis - safety\\n* UC Santa Cruz -safety\\n* Harvey Mudd - reach (also got merit here)\\n* Scripps - safety\\n* Wesleyan - match\\n* Tufts - reach (visited)\\n* WashU - reach (didn\\'t visit, also got merit here)\\n* Barnard - reach\\n* Dartmouth - reach (also got a fellowship here)\\n* Brown - reach\\n* Cornell - reach\\n* MIT - reach\\n* Stanford - reach (accepted off the WL)\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* Harvard (didn\\'t take it) -reach\\n* Pomona (didn\\'t take it) -reach\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* Yale/Yale-NUS - reach\\n* JHU - reach\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nComments:\\n\\nMy goodness DON\\'T apply to 20 schools it\\'s a dumb move and I spent my entire fall writing essays and as such got low key kind of depressed.\\n\\nBut also I don\\'t regret it because I would have had the \"What if....?\" nagging at me if I hadn\\'t (and hadn\\'t gotten in places).\\n\\nI think my rec letters might have been a huge factor in why I got into so many places, especially since I really don\\'t have engagement beyond my school community except in my sport. This also makes sense bc I didn\\'t get Regents at Cal/UCLA, and they didn\\'t take rec letters, whereas many of my friends who did get it didn\\'t get into other schools I got into. Who knows...\\n\\nOn that note, I really mean it when I say that you should get to know your teachers. What I often did is go to them and ask if they could  send me published papers on what we were learning and they LOVED that.\\n\\nI\\'m happy to look over essays or possibly share some of mine, lmk if you are interested.', 'Asian American premed and BS/MD shotgunner takes the L :( **Demographics** \\n\\nGender: Male\\n\\nRace/Ethnicity: Asian\\n\\nResidence: PA\\n\\nIncome Bracket: $150k\\n\\nType of School: Suburban Public\\n\\nHooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): N/A\\n\\nIntended Major: Pre-med (varying majors for most schools)\\n\\n**Academics** \\n\\nGPA: 3.93 UW/4.2 W\\n\\nRank: no rank available \\n\\n\\'#\\' of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Took mostly APs with a couple honors/electives tossed in (mostly senior year)\\n\\nSenior Year Course Load: AP Lit, AP Gov, Financial Literacy, AP Psych, AP Bio, Music Theory/Composition (elective)\\n\\n**Standardized Testing** \\n\\nSAT I: 1570 (770 RW, 800 M, 21 essay)\\n\\nACT: N/A\\n\\nSAT II: N/A \\n\\nAP: Calc AB (5), Micro (5), European History (5), Computer Science A (3), US History (5), Language/Composition (5), Statistics (5)\\n\\nOther: N/A\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\n*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*\\n\\n1.

It’s a WIP, but it’s a big time-consuming project that I’ve been working on for the past three years. At the time of submitting the Common App, I had no help with this EC\\n\\n**#4 School Live Broadcasting Team**: I’m a co-founder of this club. Again, I’m being a bit vague on purpose, but I basically market livestreams and operate the streaming devices/cameras and the crew\\n\\n**#5 Science Olympiad**: I was promoted to Team Captain right before apps were due. Got a few bronzes and advanced to state - not much here, just the obligatory olympiad activity lol\\n\\n**#6 National Honor Society**: NHS member since junior year, but I mostly focused on my volunteering here (25+ hours at time of app). The threshold to qualify at my school is maintenance of a 3.5+ GPA and nomination from an administrator who can speak to our leadership and character\\n\\n**#7 School Ambassador**: This was a club where we did school spirit stuff like running a haunted house and bake sales and stuff. I also listed our club\\'s initiative to fundraise for a disability-inclusive playground\\n\\n**#8 Mcdonald\\'s**: put in a year here before I couldn\\'t find the time commitment anymore lmao, felt it was worth it to put a job experience on here tho\\n\\n\\n**Awards/Honors**\\n\\n\\n#1: AP Scholar w/ Distinction\\n\\n#2: NHS member\\xa0\\n\\n#3: School Honor Roll (9-12)\\n\\nAs you can see, I didn\\'t know anything about awards or big competitions while in high school, I was just tryna surviiiiive\\n\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation**\\n\\n\\n**English Teacher**: Absolutely love her, I\\'ve had her for two years in a row and she\\'s also a major help with the livestreaming team I mentioned. We joke around a lot and I do well in her class, I come to her a lot with ideas. Saw the recommendation last week so 8/10\\n\\n**Math Teacher**: She is pretty cool, I like her but other kids at my school say she\\'s kind of scary. I had her freshman year and got her again this year for AP Calc so she knows about my academic rigor. She\\'s also the track coach and I travelled taking photos for the team sophomore year, so she knows a lot about my ECs. 7/10, never saw the letter\\n\\n**Counselor**: Absolute sweetheart I trust her 100%. Whenever I come up to her with my stupid course changes or problems keeping up with classes, she is always so understanding and helps me draw out concrete plans. She knows how much I commit to my family and I think I have an okay reputation among my school\\'s staff. 9/10\\n\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\n\\nMIT: First interview I had. Interviewer was an older gentleman so I felt relaxed. Nothing notable\\n\\nPrinceton: Loved this one. My interviewer was also black and I got to ask her about the black community at Princeton and asked for tips to get acclimated if I was accepted. I felt really comfortable in this one. Her political work really interested me and honestly she\\'s my icon now\\n\\nDuke: Uhhhh I actually don\\'t remember this one at all. I know I did the interview but I think it was just so unremarkable that I don\\'t remember it. I\\'m sure it was fine though\\n\\nGeorgetown: It was kinda freaky because the interviewer was the dad of one of my classmates lol. I live in a small town so I guess coincidences like that will always happen, but I ended up talking about school life a lot and had a pretty pleasant experience with this one!\\n\\nHarvard: I felt like he was way too casual for an interviewer, and he asked me for my stats which I thought they weren\\'t supposed to do. Kind of threw me off since he went off-track and talked about the Midwest instead of Harvard\\n\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\n\\n**Personal Statement**: Spent the most amount of time on this one, got it passed over by multiple people and am really happy with the results. I talked about how I fell into a depression after moving from Cali to the midwest right before my freshman year of high school. I\\'m a military kid so I didn\\'t have friends to help me through it. I filled the holes in my life with my academics before I fell into a crisis realizing that there was absolutely nothing unique about me at all besides my high grades that millions of other kids have, and I had no reason to live besides my family and getting into college. It took months of therapy, breaking out of my comfort zone and getting support from my family for me to reach a level of personal development comparable to my academic development. I had to take advantage of the uncontrollable change to inspire measured change in myself, if that makes sense. It wasn\\'t overly emotional, but it was an important story for the admissions officers to understand.\\n\\n**Extracurricular Activity**: Elaborated on the impact and development of the livestreaming team I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n**\"What will you bring to campus\"**: Talked about how I view everything artistically despite the fact that I\\'m a STEM major, and that I wanted to create art and stories with my fellow undergrads. Was pretty sappy tbh\\n\\n**Other Supplementals**: I reused most of them between applications but slightly altered them to answer each college\\'s prompt and fit their mission statement. For Princeton for example I focused on my community work as a school ambassador, with Caltech I focused on my comp sci projects, etc\\n\\n\\n**Decisions**\\n\\n*All decisions were done RD*\\n\\n**Acceptances**:\\n\\n-Princeton University\\n\\n-Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\n-Brown University\\n\\n-Pomona College\\n\\n-Vanderbilt University (likely letter, Dean’s Achievement Scholarship)\\n\\n-Duke University (early write)\\n\\n-Georgetown University\\n\\n-Occidental College\\n\\n-UC Santa Cruz\\n\\n-UC Irvine\\n\\n-UC San Diego\\n\\n-North Dakota State University (good merit scholarship)\\n\\n\\n**Waitlists**:\\n\\n-UC Berkeley\\n\\n-Dartmouth College\\n\\n**Rejections**:\\n\\n-Stanford University\\n\\n-Harvard University\\n\\n-Yale University\\n\\n-California Institute of Technology\\n\\n-Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\n\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n\\nI don’t know what I expected but it definitely wasn’t this. I had my safety locked in by December w/ scholarship so I felt assured that even if I completely screwed up the admissions process, I would still have somewhere affordable to go after high school. That only makes me even more grateful for the turnout this cycle.\\n\\nI committed to Princeton three days ago and I\\'m still in awe. I really got attached to Carnegie Mellon because I thought I would get rejected from every single uni that came out after that, but once Princeton FA came out I knew I couldn’t pass up the 13K/yr offer on an Ivy education.\\xa0\\n\\nUltimately I learned a lot about marketing myself, that doing three CS projects is not a spike to big tech schools, and that it is possible for a college to reduce your financial aid offer. There was a lot of other stuff in the middle but I am still sitting at my computer chair in shock, so I don’t think I can muster any intelligent thought anymore. I have to study for my AP Calc exam.

I should have and would have done more engineering related ECs, but I honestly didn’t know I was going to major in engineering until halfway through senior year first semester. A lot of these started in my junior year since Covid ruined a lot of opportunities for me and I didn’t get to do as much as I wanted.\\n\\n1. **Volunteer at a hospital for children with special needs \\\\~ 2 years**I basically hung out with the patients, who were all kids with disabilities. Came up with some pretty basic activities, reading, drawing, arts and crafts. I also started a music program where I would bring a ukulele and play for the kids. It was a good experience for me, not only for just opening up perspective, but because up until that point I thought I wanted to be in the medical field, then I realized it was actually really exhausting and I wasn’t as interested as I thought I was.\\n2. **Piano teacher \\\\~ 1.5 years**I was a volunteer on an online organization that provided free education to children around the world. This one was pretty chill, I had to get creative on how to teach piano over Zoom.\\n3. **Founded a small organization that teaches music for free \\\\~ 1 year**This was just something I decided to do because I figured I was already teaching piano, I might as well expand into music appreciation in general. It was actually pretty fun getting to gush about pop culture and nerding out over music. There were only maybe three kids who would attend. I taught some music theory and stuff but for the most part I would have them send in their favorite song/album, we’d listen to it, and I’d go into depth and do some musical analysis, as well as talk about cultural influences. For example, someone sent in The Low End Theory by A Tribe Called Quest and I got to blab about the origins of rap and how hip hop developed as a response to the economic conditions in Black communities, etc.\\n4. **Music in general**I play like 4 instruments. I’ve been in quite a few piano/cello recitals, which is pretty standard. I also did the US Open Music competition once for piano (though I didn't place anywhere lmao). I also took all the California Merit exams for piano by the time I was 14, skipping two levels and self studying the music theory portions. For funsies, I picked up the ukulele and the guitar and started a band with my friends, participated in Battle of the Bands. I didn’t put this in my activities, but I also transcribe music sometimes.\\n5. **Was an election poll worker**It was just a little summer job type of thing, show up for three days and work the entire day. It was honestly just a customer service job, but having experience with these types of things never hurt.\\n6. **Church involvement**I’m pretty involved in my church. I’m the pianist, do a bit of hymn leading, participate in choir, lead arts and crafts activities and a bit of teaching there too.\\n\\n**Awards/Honors**\\n\\nUC ELC thing, top %9 of classPresidential Volunteer Award but my dumbass forgot to put it down. That’s it lmao. No other awards.\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation**\\n\\nI only needed one since I wasn’t planning on applying to very selective schools.American Lit teacher - I honestly don’t know how I would rank this. I didn’t get to read it so I'm not sure what he put down. I wouldn’t say we had a close relationship but we talked a few times, and he really liked my writing. In all the essays we wrote, I always got his feedback and got As. We had a few creative writing assignments and he always enjoyed mine. Lowkey, in my heart, I've always been a humanities girlie.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI genuinely think my essays were the reason I could even get into any decent school. They really let my personality shine through. I consider myself an introspective person and I was able to write out a lot of my thoughts that’s been stirring around in my head for the past four years of my life. Reading them, you might be able to tell that I basically used like… 3? 4? Experiences in my life and milked the hell out of it.\\n\\n**Common App - 9/10**\\n\\nI wrote about my experiences volunteering at the children’s hospital. The main point of the essay was to show my curiosity, the way I observe things, how I form connections, and how I find solutions. For example, during the music program I lead, I met this boy who was deaf but could play the tambourine on beat, and had a surprisingly good sense of rhythm. I made a connection to what I learned in my physics class about how sound travels through vibrations. Through that I started getting curious about the human body, and basically jumped into a few rabbit holes involving topics like linguistics, audiology, etc. Then I connected that to how I make solutions to those questions, such as building something in my engineering class bc I was curious on how I could help with pollution I saw on the beach.\\n\\n**UC Essays - 8.5/10**\\n\\n* My passion and endeavors with music. Most of the stuff is already mentioned above, but more importantly how it’s a universal language and brings people together regardless of background, how it’s not about how good you can be at an instrument, but it’s about that feeling of unity you get when you’re playing together with other people. Self-expression and whatnot.\\n* Wrote about how I created an automatic sieve that filters microplastics from sand as it spins in my engineering classes. It was challenging since I was pretty new to it all, and it was completely virtual (my team sucked and I did 99% of the work) This one was more about how I have a very strong sense of spatial awareness and was able to basically visualize everything in my head.\\n* How much I love physics. This was honestly my weakest essay because it was lowkey BS, though I managed to spurn out something decent. I don’t love physics all that much - hell, I didn’t even take AP Physics. I chose physics as my topic because at the time I was writing this, I started settling on engineering and I knew I had to start molding my application into something related lol. It was less about physics itself, and more about how physics opened up other doors of science for me. Similar to my Common App tbh\\n* My experience at the Children’s Hospital, gaining new perspectives, contributing to the community, y’all know how it is. Once again, a lot of it has been mentioned above.\\n\\n**Supplementals -**\\n\\nMost of it was just the UC essay about creating that filter in the engineering class and how I was interested in the school’s programs of sustainability/green energy, or if the topic didn’t apply I would use another UC essay. My UW essay was a combination of both Common App and UCs. Reuse, reduce, recycle lmao.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):**\\n\\nAcceptances:\\n\\n* San Jose State University\\n* UC Merced\\n* UC Riverside\\n* UC Davis\\n* Santa Clara University - EA\\n* Calpoly Pomona\\n* Calpoly\\n* San Diego State\\n* Penn State - EA\\n* UIUC - EA (this was the most surprising!!!)\\n* UCSC\\n* Rowan University - EA for their BSMD program (I literally only applied because my mom was being delusional and she was so convinced that I would become a doctor)\\n\\nWaitlists:\\n\\n* Purdue - EA (Didn’t sign up for waitlist)\\n* UC San Diego - Rejected\\n\\nRejections:\\n\\n* UC Irvine (Aerospace)\\n* UC Santa Barbara\\n* UC Berkeley (Environmental Sciences)\\n* UCLA (Materials Engineering)\\n* UW\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA little reflection:\\n\\nHonestly I was genuinely shocked by the fact I got into any UC or FREAKING UIUC for EE (!!) considering the fact I didn’t take AP Calc BC or AP Physics. I only applied for funsies, just to toss my hat in the ring. I remember literally opening the portal while I was on the toilet and my jaw dropped.  Unfortunately they didn’t give me any financial aid. $60,000 for one year is a lot and it’s not worth it long term financially imo, but hey, if it was grad school it’d be a much different story. Maybe it’s the impostor syndrome speaking because I would hardly call EE my passion. I changed my mind last minute to this major so I kinda just got here without trying hard for it.\\n\\nMy top 3 I was deciding between was Davis, UIUC, or Santa Clara University. I was really considering SCU because it has very strong industry ties, they’re very well funded, and they gave me enough financial aid where it was the same price as a UC. But I also live 10 minutes away from it and I wanted to be out of the house for my own character development. I felt like I wasn’t appreciating what I had, and I needed to spend some time away from home so I could come back with a newfound appreciation.\\n\\nI ended up committing to UC Davis because it’s far enough from home where I can be independent but I can also come back easily when I need to, and I like the vibe of the campus. It’s not competitive, everyone’s pretty laid back and friendly. Solid reputation, not as prestigious as UIUC but finding internships won’t be terrible. It’s boring in Sacramento, sure, but as an EE student I’m probably going to be indoors a lot of the time.\\n\\nI have never been a very ambitious person. Sometimes I think about if I should have applied for more competitive schools and given the T20s a shot, but after visiting a lot of them, I had this really deep gut feeling that I just don’t fit in with the campuses and the student body. I’m not sure how to describe the feeling, but a wave of dread washed over me. Like I genuinely felt like I would go crazy or get depressed. It seemed a little too far away from me. I’m happy with UC Davis.\", \"Drama student gets a full ride to their dream school  The sub needed more arts majors and mine is super specific so I wanted to give another perspective!\\n\\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* (Sex: Female)\\n* Gender: Non-binary\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Black\\n* Residence: NC\\n* Income Bracket: Lower middle class, 45k range\\n* Type of School: Arts-based magnet public high school, large student body\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM, LGBT+\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Production and Design for Stage/Screen so a BFA Drama degree\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.8/4.1\\n* Rank (or percentile): 83/413\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 13 Honors, 6 AP classes\\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP Bio, AP Gov, AP Lit, Honors Shakespeare, Honors Math, Honors Latin, Technical Theater (class pertaining to my major)\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\\n\\n* SAT: 680 - ERW, 560 - Math, 16 - Writing\\n* ACT: 29 (29 - English, 23 - Math, 36 - Reading, 26 - Science)\\n* AP/IB: AP Lang (4), AP Psych (4), AP Gov (taking soon), AP Lit (taking soon)\\n* Other (ex.

Last was my counselor, likely the weakest as she has other students but she likes me well enough so I'm estimating a 7 or 8.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nMarymount Manhattan: My first interview and my only group interview. Required me to go over my portfolio alongside other prospective students but earned me an additional scholarship so I think it went well! (9/10)\\n\\nPace University: Second interview and it went great. I had to discuss how I would stage a play I was given to read ahead of time. Was told I was definitely admitted and should look forward to a call soon but I did ask about minors within the program and was told it'd be pretty difficult but not impossible which was a little awkward. (9/10)\\n\\nNYU: Last interview and also went great. The interviewer and I had a great rapport and conversation flowed easily. Ended up going slightly over time as we got carried away on a tangent lol. (10/10)\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI talked about activism and animal crossing! I compared feeling like I wasn't making real change with feeling like my island was never going to reach 5 stars. Gonna be honest, I'm really proud of this one. I would say writing is my strong suit so I started brainstorming early but the actual writing only took an hour or two. From start to finish, it maybe took me a week but I didn't write consistently.\\n\\n**Portfolio**\\n\\nI struggled most with this part as I didn't know production theater needed to submit a portfolio until I started applying. by then, my last show had finished and my theater was closed for covid. I work sound so I also just didn't have a lot to show. I included call sheets I made for my department, pics of the set I helped build and progress/prototype shots, and the mic list for past productions. I included a section talking about my responsibilities on our next show and my role as department lead.

I think I had such great success because of my interviews + grades. Having direct technical theater experience definitely helped and my technical director also wrote a LOR so hopefully, my passion showed. My personal statement also had a really strong voice and I feel it showcased a lot of my personality, which helped give me an edge. I kinda wished I applied to more schools just to see if I could get in but I also had extensive information on every school I applied to for interviews as it was a smaller list to research so maybe not.\\n\\nGood luck on this next chapter everyone!

He\\'s really professional (taught for 28 years now), taught more than 1200+ students, and prepared like forty International Mathematical Olympiad winners (crazy, right?); considers me as one of the best students he\\'s seen in his entire teaching career (I felt happy when I heard that from him, knowing he has a ton of experience as a teacher); 10/10\\n\\nRec 2- English Teacher; known for 4 years; helped me improve my self-esteem and gain confidence to speak properly in presentations; knows my backstory as well; always commented on how I was the best student he\\'s seen in his entire teaching career (taught for 5+ years, I think) and how I persevered despite my circumstances; also a kind person; 10/10\\n\\nRec 3- Computer Science Teacher; got to know him this year in the private school I enrolled in; also commented on how I\\'m the best student he\\'s seen in his entire teaching career  (if I remember correctly, he told me he taught for 12 years) and how I have a pleasant and \"kind\" aura around me; regarded me as a mature student who knows what to do in the future; 10/10\\n\\nRec 4- From my research mentor; I really liked his personality and professionalism; after finishing the program, evaluated me as a person who is self-motivated and can properly self-study (I taught myself LaTeX and some computer programs needed for maths); wrote down that I was in the top 10% of mathematicians he\\'d seen in his career and can conduct university-level research despite being a high schooler (says a lot since the guy has a Bachelor\\'s degree and a PhD from MIT); 9-10/10\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nI was not offered an interview.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nPersonal Statement- I poured my heart and soul in writing this; cried many times in front of my essay advisor from Columbia University.\\n\\nI wrote my essay on how my father physically and emotionally abused my three younger brothers and I, how he was absent in our lives, and how much of an impact that had on my family\\'s growth (one of them had depression, another one had the lowest grades in his class, and the last one was very asocial); ended it with my personal growth (how I became a father-figure for my younger bros), how I am very actively involved in my brothers\\' lives, and who I am today (kind, empathetic, somewhat of a comedian(this sort of naturally happened, cheering up my brothers came with this; my friends tell me I\\'m the master of dad jokes), etc); 10/10\\n\\nSupplementals- pretty good essays; wrote on why I want to study Maths and who I look up to as role-models; 8/10\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* *N/A*\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* N/A\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* *Harvard REA*\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n1. My primary language is English. I lived in the US for 4-5 years (from 1st to 5th grade) and consider myself a native speaker (I forgot all my native languages from my home country). At home, our family always speaks in English, with some conversations sometimes held in my native language. I was kind of surprised when I saw my TOEFL score so low. My English teacher from the UK used to say that I was like a typical US/UK student with no problems in English (especially in speaking, I have an American accent and somewhat of a broad vocabulary).\\n\\n2. Is it too late to submit my IELTS score? I\\'m preparing to take it on the 7th of January (results come out after 7 days), so I can immediately submit my score on the 14th-15th. Some people have told me it\\'s not, some have, genuinely confused.\\n\\n3. I lived far away from the schools I attended (10+ km away, to be exact; luckily, they were boarding schools, so every week I would arrive to school on Monday and leave on Friday or Saturday). I used to wake up at 5:30-6 AM, take the bus for approx. 1.5-2 hours, and arrive at school at 8:30-8:45 AM-ish. The crazy thing is that school starts at 9 AM, so I was always stressed on whether I would be late to school or not.\\n\\n4. To anyone who didn\\'t get into RSI or any summer program, Lumiere Education is one of the best online research programs I\\'ve seen. It\\'s a program founded by two people from Harvard and Oxford. Mentors are professional and kind, assistants are of top-notch quality (always respond to your emails in less than a day), and the founders are quite charismatic. They also give merit-based financial aid (full or partial, I believe; I got full fin. aid (didn\\'t pay anything)). At the end of the program, they organized a closing ceremony with Professor Oliver Hart (Nobel Prize Winner in Economics). 10/10 would recommend to anyone who wishes to apply to a summer program.\\n\\n5. Regarding my personality type, I\\'m an INFJ. I kinda have this superpower of understanding what others go through by a glance of their face and can give somewhat wise and useful tips to anyone. I\\'m a heavy listener and can listen to anyone talk about any issue they have for hours (I legit listened to a friend of mine on a personal issue of his for 5-6 hours; pretty crazy tbh).\\n\\n7. I had some mental health problems and is why I probably got low SAT and TOEFL scores. I took TOEFL Home Edition at 11 PM (BIG MISTAKE). By the time I got to the listening section, I wanted to go to sleep. I don\\'t know what I was thinking tbh.\\n\\n8. I wrote a uni supplemental essay on how my mother is an inspiration to me (she worked 2 different jobs before the pandemic to support our family. Work time for her is from 9 AM to 8-9 PM)\\n\\nWhen I got my rejection letter from Harvard, I cried for days, knowing I may no longer have any chances at any of my dream schools. I really want to support my family financially.\\n\\nI realize this post is pretty long, but please provide me with constructive feedback.', \"An Emotionally Exhausted Senior's Advice to Fellow Sad Seniors Facing Rejections and Disappointment Several hours pass by as you sign in and out and in and out of college application portals, anxiously waiting for an update. It’s been months since you’ve submitted your college applications and in mere seconds you click to find out your fate. Three options await you: rejected, waitlisted, accepted.\\n\\nYou hover your mouse over the link, take a deep breath, and click, but your heart drops as you read the words “cannot offer admission”. Your eyes water with tears, ready to burst. At first, this rejection will feel like the end of your life. If you can’t get into this school, how can you possibly get into all the other schools you’ve applied to and are waiting to hear from?\\n\\nAs your mind continues on this downward spiral, you begin to contemplate what you could have done wrong. And when you hear your friends or classmates got into the same school, you are proud, but deeply saddened and envious at the same time. You immediately compare yourself to your friends and make assumptions that you’re “not smart enough”, “not accomplished enough”, “not interesting enough”.\\n\\n“Enough”. The feeling of not being “good enough” is a universal emotion that all high school seniors experience during the college application process. It is the only thing guaranteed by the whole process really. This is a very sad but true fact. (Rarely do students ever get into all of the schools they applied to. Often do students cry their eyes out and bawl. Fun fact, I for one am a really ugly crier. I hope you all do not suffer from the same misfortune as I do.) So, the idea of “being good enough” for a college is talked about constantly, but what does “being enough” really mean? How do you determine your self worth? By the prestige of the college you attend? By the acceptance rate of the college which you attend? Or do you determine your self worth by the positive change you create in the world and the people whose lives you have touched?\\n\\nFor years you’ve been told the most important thing to focus on in high school is college. Getting into a college. But not just getting into any college, getting into a GOOD college. And I have to ask you, what does a “good” college even constitute? Is a “good” college a college with a well known name? A college that produces the most famous alumni? Or a college that supports you and helps you in your journey to succeed? This is not to say that a prestigious college cannot be and do both things, but to ask you to reconsider what is really most important to you. Are you interested in a college because of its prestige or because it fits your needs and wants in a school?\\n\\nAs you concentrate on getting accepted into a “good” college right now, I urge you to focus on what is truly best for you and not what “looks” the best. This may come as a shock to many of you (That was pure sarcasm to be clear.), but you DO NOT need to get into an Ivy League school to be successful. There are many people who attended community college and are successful. And I want to note that they are/were successful NOT in spite of the college they attended, but because of who they are/were as people and how hard they worked. Steve Jobs, Morgan Freeman, Walt Disney, Eddie Murphy, Halle Berry, Queen Latifah, James Dean, Arnold Schwarzenegger... And well, if I’m honest, being a White person certainly helps a lot, but that’s not my point here. My list could probably go on and on and on, but this post is already too long and I really want you to finish reading my post until the end.\\n\\nAnyway, my point is that if everybody needed to go to any Ivy League level school, we’d all be screwed. And all this is to say that you DON’T need to attend an Ivy League level school to be successful. The vast majority of the human population has not attended an Ivy League level school. So before you find yourself feeling unworthy, unaccomplished, or stupid for applying to colleges you got rejected by, please remember how dangerous and harmful it is to equate your self worth to the name and reputation of the college you attend. It is completely and wholly unnecessary. Nobody will ask at your funeral in the future what college you attended because it truly doesn’t matter as much as you think it does right now. That probably sounds really harsh, but it's true.\\n\\nSo if you are currently dealing with insecurities about your self worth, I want to tell you that I’ve been there, and I am still dealing with my insecurity as I continue to hear back from colleges this application cycle. But I think I have learned a lot throughout my college application process, and most importantly what I have learned and am continuing to learn about is that you CAN and SHOULD only focus on what is in your control. We all know that everybody dies at some point, but we don’t live our whole lives obsessing over when we will die and how we will die and where we will die because like the colleges we get rejected from, we do not have complete control in these situations. I understand that’s an extreme example, but I used it because I know that way too many students each year fall into severe depression over the colleges they are rejected from and I don’t want this to happen to all of you or myself. College is only 4 years of your life and most people live up to around 80, so even though college feels like the scariest and most important thing in your life, it is not. Your college years will only make up a very tiny and minor percentage of your whole life (By the way, the math result is 5% for those like me who are not mathematically inclined.).\\n\\nYou have worked for months and years preparing for college applications only for the admissions officers to quickly read your numerous essays and student profile in mere minutes. You have tried your absolute best and stayed up numerous nights checking and rereading essay after essay for any mistakes. But as soon as your application is sent to the college for review, the control leaves your hands and then you have done pretty much everything you can really do. The reality of the college admission process is that admissions officers only learn a small snippet of the characteristics, qualities, quirks, and achievements that make up who you are. After all, they only have so much time to review your application and you only have so large of a word count to sum up the complicated explanation of who you are as a person and why. That is exactly why I think it is important to not take rejection so personally because you are bigger than the name of the college you ultimately attend. And I know firsthand that it’s incredibly difficult, but do not let these admissions officers undermine your self confidence and invalidate your achievements. You have worked too hard for many years to let people who you don’t even know and don’t even know you tear you down. Also, their decision to accept you, reject you, or put you on the waitlist is based more on luck than you might know. Small factors such as how much sleep they got the night before or whether they were hungry while reading your application do have some impact on their decision to an extent.\\n\\nSo before you spend time obsessing over your rejection, please ask yourself this: would you rather attend a college that wants you or a college that doesn’t want you? In my opinion, you should attend a college that wants you. So when you’re rejected from a school, there is nothing else you can do but move on. You deserve to be wanted. You deserved to feel praised and accomplished. You have worked so hard and come so far, so do not look back, dwelling on what could’ve been. The past is the past and cannot be changed, but the future is what you make of it. You can choose to move forward and make the most out of your experience at whatever college you attend. This choice is within your power and control. Please remember it is not the prestige of the college that decides how successful you’ll be in the future because ultimately your success is up to you. If you cannot live in the present, you’ll be stuck in the past. And if you are stuck in the past, you cannot see the future. To my fellow Seniors, you have much ahead of you and will go on to achieve many great things. Do not let the results of your college applications block your sight from seeing what is truly important.\\n\\nAs colleges continue to send out decisions, do allow yourself to be sad and take time to heal. It is important to validate your feelings. I am not at all trying to say that you don’t deserve to be sad after being rejected from a college. I just hope you remember that at the end of the day, you can only focus on what you can control. And what you can control is how you respond and whether you continue onward. So please do not allow college decisions to take up your mind all day. Colleges that reject you DO NOT at all deserve any part of your mental space or any further thought after a couple cathartic sessions of crying in the shower.\\n\\nOn a side note, I know I keep repeating the same words over and over again, but it is about 12:30 AM and I am exhausted from writing this. It’s taken me almost three hours, so if my post has helped you in any way, please tell me and feel free to share anything you’ve learned along the way while applying to and hearing back from colleges. Also, please leave any constructive criticism or thoughts. I’m always open to learning more and looking at issues from different perspectives. I’m very curious as to how people will respond to this post, but first the bigger issue is who is crazy enough to read a post this long? If you’ve read this ending statement, congratulations for having an attention span longer than a TikTok video or being as impatient as I am and immediately skipping to the end! Either way, thank you so much for considering my measly thoughts and opinions whether you agree, disagree, or clicked off this post as soon as you saw how long it is. Anyway, I wish everybody the best of luck with their college decisions and I’m rooting for everybody! You can get through this hard time and know that it's okay to have ups and downs. Also know that we can't all smile constantly. Life is kind of like a sin wave: really frustrating and annoyingly fluctuant.\\n\\nUpdate (3/26/21): Hi everyone, I just wanted to share an update about my college notification decisions. So far, I have been rejected from 4 schools, waitlisted at 3 schools, and accepted by 7 schools. I’m still waiting to hear back from 5 schools.\\n\\nFor all those who feel like they are the only ones being rejected or waitlisted by colleges, please know you're not the only one. We can get through this together if we believe in ourselves.\", \"Average applicant gets average results......don't really know how to feel at this point.......

I'm not sure if I was even eligible to be considered in it because only one of the programs mentioned about details for selection criteria of oversea US applicants while the others weren't specific about this. (Only US citizens can apply to these type of programs)\\n* GPA:  N/A (my school doesn't do GPAs, but I was able to calculate it on my own and came out at around 3.7-3.8 though I'm not entirely sure if it this accurate. In general, I did have straight A results for the past three years after a rocky start at high school.)\\n* Academic honors: distinction in my Biology O level examinations (top in the country) and first position in my school's Biology A level first year examinations (mocks + midterms exams)\\n* Standardized testing scores (SAT): 1450 (790 M, 660 RW)\\n\\n**Activities/Extracurriculars:**\\n\\n* Took part in multiple MUNs (did get some small personal awards and was the marketing director for my school's MUN event once)\\n* participated in my school's community service society. (We would invite children from a nearby underprivileged community and do many activities with them)\\n* took part in a special internship and observer ship program at one of the best medical schools in my city (I collaborated with the medical school's community medicine society and was able to learn & discuss about various topics, attended lectures and was able to get a glimpse of medical school life. This lasted a few weeks and was really fun :))\\n* took part in a community outreach program at the same medical school (coincidentally it happened during my internship and observer ship. It was more of a community service activity)\\n* was part of my school's science society and our team once won runner up position at a local Olympiad (didn't get to participate too much in it though)\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendations:**\\n\\n* Chemistry teacher: 9/10, he is honestly my favorite teacher. Since the start of my A-Levels he really motivated me a lot to do my best and I was able to strive in Chemistry under him (even though he spoke more in the local language here which I don't really understand very well). I was also among his personal favorite students in class and while I did not get to see what he wrote, I bet it was great. I still of course have to work hard for my A-Level CAIEs now and maintain my consistency in the subject.\\n* Biology Teacher: 7/10, he did not really know how to write it, so I sort of had to give him a rough draft but at the same time I was busy with my assessments and other things that I feel that I could've given him a better draft lol.\\n* Internship/Observer ship supervisor: 9/10, I had a good relationship with him and was able to work on so many things with him and his department. I am really glad he took out the time to write it out as he was really busy at the time :)\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\n* 8/10: I wrote about my motivation of doing medicine which came through by seeing the poverty and poor healthcare infrastructure in the country where I'm residing in. My parents and counsellors liked it, but I think it was a bit too general....\\n* 7/10: I had A LOT of supplements to prepare, especially for the BS/MD programs. They were not too bad but not too good either as most of them were aimed at my extracurriculars which was honestly one of my weaknesses in my application....\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nWith the one and only WashU and I took my chance. I would give it a 7/10 as I feel like I could've asked more questions as my interviewer led the conversation more than I did.\\n\\n**Decisions (RD/EA/ED/Rolling)**\\n\\n* University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou): Rolling - accepted and awarded with $22.5k scholarship.\\n* University of Missouri-Kansas City (umkc): RD - rejected by BS/MD program but accepted to regular undergrad.\\n* Maryville University of St. Louis - Rolling: accepted and awarded with 14k scholarship.\\n* Siena College: RD - rejected by BS/MD program but accepted to regular undergrad.\\n* University of Iowa: EA - accepted (scholarship yet to be specified)\\n* University of Pittsburgh: Rolling - waitlisted\\n* WashU St. Louis: RD - Rejected (this hurt me the most as my dad did his post graduate fellowship from here)\\n* John Hopkins: ED - Rejected (Didn't expect to get in anyways lmao)\\n* Case Western University: EA - deferred and then waitlisted after going into RD.\\n* NYU NYC (main campus): RD - Rejected literally just one hour ago lol while I'm writing this post (depressed though)\\n* IUPUI (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis): rolling - accepted.\\n* Stony Brook University: RD - Accepted (might have a scholarship didn't check yet)\\n* University of Connecticut: RD - Rejected by BS/MD but was surprisingly accepted to undergrad with 19k scholarship. (Though it's still really expensive)\\n* St. Bonaventure University: RD - Rejected by the BS/MD program.\\n\\n**Waiting on: Duke, Yale (no hopes for these two in a realistic sense) and Saint Louis University (maybe might have a chance on this one)**\\n\\n**Personal things to add:**\\n\\nSo, I am from the United States but had to move to Asia a couple of years ago due to personal family circumstances. But the thing is that I've never felt adapted to the new environment and people here. It was and is honestly tough to make friends and develop connections here as I'm not too fluent in the local language either. This is the main reason that I feel like made my high school journey was quite turbulent. During my first two years I was a below average student in terms of grades (with a lot Bs and Cs) and found it hard to motivate myself to do more in extracurriculars. While the pandemic helped me change my academic strategies and perform much better in the remaining three years of high school, I just didn't put in the effort in my extracurriculars (which was due to the different environment and type of people here and the fear of not being to balance it out with my academics as I did not want to take any chances if my grades fell again).\\n\\nYou may also be wondering why I applied to some of the T25/T50 colleges too. Well, honestly, I only wanted to apply to Yale and Johns Hopkins (based on my personal interest even though I never stood a chance) but my parents kind of pushed me to apply to other top colleges too (as they thought I would have a good shot since I come from a pretty complicated Asian background and other stuff) But even despite that I feel like I should've gone test optional for these top colleges as the medians were clearly higher than 1450. However, my counsellor continued to persuade me to send them to these top colleges as it would make me a better applicant than those who did not submit (idk if that's true lol). I should've known better tbh as I was pretty clueless about this. But my extracurriculars were pretty weak too.\\n\\nI plan to do medicine and now that I have some acceptances at some middle tier to average schools, I'll have to decide soon. I also have the option of doing medicine from the Asian country where I'm currently residing in (which unlike the US does not require any undergrad prior to med school and you can directly matriculate after completing high school). It also takes 5 years (vs 8 years in the USA) and is much cheaper too. But because of my experiences here in middle school and high school outside the classroom and realms of academics and with the lack of connections and issues I've faced, I'm kind of unsure if I want to even consider it here as med school life is really challenging.\\n\\nAnyways, I've just always wanted to go back to the United States to not only do medicine but also to bring a change in myself both personally and for my family after living here in Asia and now I have the chance to do so (even though it might be a bit more expensive). I feel like I had the potential to do so much better, but I feel my personal circumstances really brought me down. I apologize if this all felt too personal and came across as being cringey and ungrateful. It's just that this has all been over my head for the past few months and did not have anyone other than my parents to discuss this with as I don't really have any close friends here and I thought this would be a great opportunity to share this with you all on this subreddit page which is mostly full of people with 1500+ SAT scores, perfect GPAs and stellar ECs (no hate to them though, they are honestly pretty motivating to me Haha).\\n\\nI would appreciate any feedback from y'all!\\n\\nThank you and good luck with your applications everyone :))\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: I was unsurprisingly rejected by both duke and yale :(\", 'International Stanford REA Reject - Hope it helps **Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Male\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian\\n* Residence: Some Country in East Asia\\n* Income Bracket: I\\'m international so I would have paid full, didn\\'t add income info\\n* Type of School: International private school with terrible grade deflation, clueless administrative office.

Honestly was really proud of them, but I guess Stanford didn\\'t feel the same .\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* *fuck*\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* *fuck*\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* *Stanford REA*\\n\\n**Additional Information:** Elaborated on my extracurriculars.\\n\\nReally wish I could have been posting this with an acceptance, but oh well. Time to shotgun the T20s.\\n\\nI really don\\'t want to make excuses, but I think a large part of what broke me was the school I come from. A lot of my extracurriculars were self-initiated because of the lack of extracurriculars around me. My school is a far-from-competitive microcosm with a clueless administrative board, so the only extracurriculars available were school-wide clubs, student government, and the National Honors Society. I dabbled in each and noped the fuck out because they all felt like absolute jokes--nothing of substance goes on in any of them. Grade deflation is notoriously rampant as well, which is ludicrous considering my school is too small to be recognized by any regional AO (class has less than 30 people, so all As wouldn\\'t mean anything to the institution, why give Bs). School\\'s a joke. Counselor is great though.\\n\\nI\\'d really love to go to a T5. Yale, Princeton, and Harvard in particular because they excel in both the science and the humanities. My niche interest is a mix of both, so they\\'d be perfect. Then again, as an international in that typical middle-class limbo (enough dough to barely afford tuition, but too much dough to qualify as low income), the prestige of the institution I matriculate into must justify the money I\\'ll have to pay. Shallow, but this is pretty much the mindset of every semi-competitive international student set on the T10s.\\n\\nHarvard was my first choice (need-blind for intls, joint program for a master\\'s, cross-registration for classes at MIT, located in Boston), but I decided to shoot my shot at Stanford because of its flat grading system and somewhat motivated entrepreneurial climate. Rejected yesterday, what an experience. Obviously a little depressed, but I\\'ve already lost feelings for the unusually computer science oriented, marijuana-reeking, car-jacking capital, roach-breeding ground that is Stanford. I\\'d love to go there for grad school though.', 'Wanna see what shotgunning 30 decisions looks like? I will say that this is slightly misleading now that I am looking back. Only 26 colleges were applied to, but there were 30 decisions total. This was for class of 2025, but I didn\\'t post in the past because even though it\\'s been more than 6 months, I can\\'t say I\\'m over these results. I\\'ll add more in the note at the end. To those of you that recognize me, please ignore this and do not send this around. I still am not over my college decisions so I would rather this stay anonymous.\\n\\n**Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Male\\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian - Han/Hui/Uyghur Chinese\\n* Residence: Southern California\\n* Income Bracket: Middle-upper class (did not apply for financial aid)\\n* Type of School: Competitive Californian public school\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): Legacy at Cornell\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: This is going to get very complicated. I was basically undecided but I applied Astronomy + Religion/Philosophy at almost every university except computer science at UCs (mainly because it is easier to transfer out of CS than transfer into CS at UCs, as opposed to private schools where you don\\'t have to declare your major later, especially that CS was something that interested me)\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.9/4.5\\n* Rank (or percentile): Unranked\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 17 APs, 5 courses taken through UCSD summer session (linear algebra, multivariable calculus, vector calculus, organic chemistry 2, organic chemistry 3)\\n* Senior Year Course Load: 4 APs\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n* SAT I: N/A\\n* ACT: 35 (35E, 35M, 34R, 36S)\\n* SAT II: Math II (800), Chemistry (800), Chinese with listening (800)\\n* AP/IB: Basically all 5s (for the pre-senior year APs) except for a 3 in AP US History and a 2 in AP Music Theory\\n* Other (ex.

Quizbowl - Team captain and led team to 14th place at nationals; ranked top 10 in regular season; coached teams and players - even made youtube videos to help people study\\n2. Academic Competition Federation - I wrote quizbowl questions for the main college quizbowl organization (I am the first high school student to write for their Regional\\'s tournament, which is the qualifying tournament for the college national championship)\\n3. Science Olympiad - Was on school\\'s varsity Science Olympiad team. I coached the event Astronomy where all 5 teams from my school swept the top 5 places at our regional\\'s competition. Also qualified for State\\'s but COVID cancelled it.\\n4. USAAAO - Qualified for the United States Astrophysics and Astronomy Olympiad!\\n5.

I really can\\'t remember the other things I filled in. Maybe I put in my quizbowl placements (state championship, national placements, etc.). Fun fact: I was a finalist for my school\\'s homecoming court in my sophomore year though I don\\'t think I put that in my application since that would be very cringe.\\n4. &#x200B;\\n5. &#x200B;\\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation**\\n\\nAP Statistics Teacher (6-7/10): This teacher knew me very well. She was the teacher I was closest with, and also served as the advisor and coach for Quizbowl, which I dedicated at least 15 hours to every week, so she knew how hard I worked. My main issue was that everyone told me she was not a very good writer, so I don\\'t know how well she articulated her recommendation of me.\\n\\nAP English Literature Teacher (9/10): This teacher also knew me well. Perhaps not as well as the previous teacher, but we knew each other for two years. We would compete in trivia competitions together and both of us liked the same books. I dabbled in creative writing and this teacher would help me edit my work and always encouraged me to publish since he told me I was a good writer. I was always too nervous and to this day have never published anything even though I have so many short stories and manuscripts saved on my computer. This teacher was said to be a very strong writer, and getting his letter of recommendation was supposedly very difficult, so I do give him a high rating.\\n\\nCounselor (0/10): I\\'ve never met this woman in my life.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nMy interviews went pretty well. Most interviews were fairly generic discussions, but I had an interviewer that had a Wikipedia page and another interviewer cried when I told him my family situation since he said it was very touching. My Harvard interviewer was distracted the whole time and when I mentioned I considered law as a field, she was like \"that requires dedication and a work ethic and\" \\\\*scoffs\\\\* \"I don\\'t know...\" She did not keep talking, but I was pretty upset with her insinuation and ended the interview early. My Princeton interviewer was amazing. We talked for many hours, and we even emailed for a few weeks after talking about books. When I got rejected, he even brought up checking with AOs about if the rejection was real (I told him not to). He still told me to keep in contact with him if I ever needed his help in finding a job in the future. I love that guy.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\nI had two really good essays that I would alternate as my main essays based on which essays I could also incorporate into my supplementals. One of them was about my brother\\'s autism and how kids with autism are not given fair opportunities, so I worked with kids with autism and that made me want to pursue a field where I could help others. The other essay was about my love of trivia, and how I worked hard to go from a player on my school\\'s third quizbowl team to be the captain on a team that was ranked top 10 nationally. They sound kind of boring right now, but I felt like they were very good essays when put into context. Plus, I even paid professionals to edit my essays and they said the essays were good too. Most of my supplemental essays were very good too. I honestly believe that the strongest part of my application was my essays, so who knows?\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\nI applied for every school that my parents said they would be proud of me if I attended except for CalTech. Basically every good UC, two OOS public universities, and every top private university except CalTech. Also added in Swarthmore and Pomona (my own choice).\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* University of California - San Diego (RD)\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* Cornell University (ED) (deferral) (later rejected)\\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (EA) (deferral) (later rejected)\\n* University of Chicago (EA) (deferral) (later rejected)\\n* Harvard University (RD)\\n* Yale University (RD)\\n* Princeton University (RD)\\n* Columbia University (RD)\\n* University of Pennsylvania (RD)\\n* Brown University (RD)\\n* Dartmouth College (RD)\\n* Stanford University (RD)\\n* Duke University (RD)\\n* Johns Hopkins University (RD)\\n* Northwestern University (RD)\\n* Vanderbilt University (RD)\\n* Rice University (RD)\\n* Pomona College (RD)\\n* Swarthmore College (RD)\\n* Carnegie Mellon University (RD) (waitlisted first, later rejected)\\n* University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (EA) (deferral) (waitlisted first, later rejected)\\n* University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (EA) (waitlisted first, later rejected)\\n* University of California - Berkeley (RD)\\n* University of California - Los Angeles (RD)\\n* University of California - Irvine (RD)\\n* University of California - Santa Barbara (RD)\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nIf I could apply again, I would definitely cut this college list down. I definitely had enough time to write all my essays and make them good, but it was way too expensive. I do regret applying ED to Cornell - I don\\'t even like that school that much, it\\'s just that I had legacy and that didn\\'t even prove useful. If anything, I would say that the schools I liked the most were Princeton, University of Chicago, Rice, and Swarthmore. I would honestly be fine applying to just those 4 schools and the UCs, but I think my college application mindset was geared far more towards getting into schools that would make my dad happy.\\n\\nAfter all of these rejections, I was not feeling great. My school\\'s Naviance shows me as having the highest stats out of all the people from my school to ever apply to half of these schools. At UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara, I was at least 2 ACT points and 0.2 GPA points above the next highest statted rejection.\\n\\nI did not feel great after my college results, and was honestly very depressed. UCSD is a great school, but 29 rejections really hits hard. I was also very upset to see other students that I did not get along with get into better schools. It\\'s even more upsetting when you overhear your Asian parents talking to the local Asian parent community and they\\'re like \"oh, your son only got into UCSD. I\\'m so sorry. My son is actually very smart and got into all of these other schools.\" Trust me. Some of these parents around here love to gossip and I hate it. My parents still supported me. My only other sibling has autism, so they always tell me they\\'ll be proud of me no matter where I end up, but regardless I was pretty upset.\\n\\nLast week I finished my first quarter at UCSD. I did not expect I would become a CS major, but CS is honestly getting a bit more interesting. I still might change my majors, but as of right now I am a double major in CS and religion. I heavily considered transferring, but the transfer experience does not sound that interesting to me. I have honestly started to enjoy UCSD a lot - I got extremely involved with a church here, found a new best friend, and learned to cook very fancy foods. But my college rejections still linger in my mind, and every once in a while, I still think to myself - \"what if I went to a different college.\" I know the experience would probably be more or less the same, though I would have preferred a more liberal arts experience (hence why I liked Princeton and Swarthmore so much). I probably actually would enjoy UCSD more because I love the people here, but regardless of all of that, I still can\\'t say I\\'ve fully gotten over all of these rejections. Oh well. Hopefully this post will be of interest to some people.\\n\\nEdit: I will say, that my personal conclusion is that it was God\\'s will that I would go to UCSD and that there is a purpose for me there. Of course, I know many here are not religious. But deep down, I can\\'t fully say whether or not I actually believe that, or I am just lying to myself in order to comfort myself.', \"insecure girl who posted (deleted since then) a year ago about being genuinely afraid of not getting into any college gets pleasantly surprised and gains a whole lot of self-confidence :) **Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: female (she/they)\\n* Race/Ethnicity: southeast asian!\\n* Residence: bay area\\n* Income Bracket: $180kish (7 family members)\\n* Type of School: private school (scholarship kid hehe), ig it would be a magnet school?\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): hmm... i mean urm if ppl could southeast asian separate from east and south asian, also bi but idk if that matters in admissions :)\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: i applied primarily human bio or cell bio bc those are harder to transfer into but also hoping to do something w ochem + english lit + poly sci! also pre-med!\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.87 / 4.61\\n* Rank (or percentile): we don't rank!\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 7 honors, 3 aps, 7 ibs (two years)\\n* Senior Year Course Load: ib mathematics analysis and approaches hl, ib biology hl, ib english literature hl, ib history of the americas hl, ib spanish b sl, ib environmental systems and societies sl, ib theory of knowledge sl\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\\n\\n* SAT I: 1510 (730 RW, 780 M)\\n* ACT: n/a\\n* SAT II: mathematics 2 (800)\\n* AP/IB: ap calculus ab (5), ap european history (4), ap english literature (3)\\n* Other (ex.

11/10\\n\\nall my supplemental essays are p decent, i just submitted different versions of like four of the same essays to every single school (my counselor got *really* tired of reading them after a while). the only person i let read and asked to review my essay was my counselor and even then it's just basic stuff so they're all p authentic and stuff! i took a poetic spin on all of them and played around w the structure and stuff and at the moment, i despised them, but in hindsight they were actually really good ahaha! 8-9/10\\n\\n**Decisions -- Listed In The Order That I Like Them (completely personal ahaha!)**\\n\\n*note:* ik it looks like a lot, but i had waivers for most of them! i didn't include financial aid j merit scholarships per year in here!\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* Stanford University (RD, probably committing, but still waiting on financial aid!)\\n* University of California Berkeley (RD, $10,000 in research funds + $10,000 scholarship)\\n* Emory University (scholarship deadline, honors, full tuition merit scholarship -- might consider instead of Stanford)\\n* University of California Los Angeles (RD)\\n* Columbia University (RD, honestly i love Columbia, but expensive!! yikes!!)\\n* Washington University St. Louis (RD, $3,000 scholarship)\\n* University of Michigan (EA, honors)\\n* Tulane University (EA, $18,000 scholarship, honors)\\n* University of California San Diego (RD)\\n* University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (EA, honors)\\n* Boston University (RD)\\n* University of California Davis (RD, regents, $7,500 scholarship)\\n* Purdue University (EA, honors)\\n* University of California Santa Cruz (RD, honors)\\n* University of California Riverside (RD, honors, $20,000 scholarship, my ex goes here, def not)\\n* CalPoly San Luis Obispo (RD, honors)\\n* University of Pittsburgh (rolling, honors, $10,000 scholarship)\\n* Santa Clara University (RD, honors, $14,000 scholarship)\\n* Rochester Institute of Technology (RD, $27,500 scholarship)\\n\\n*Waitlists:*\\n\\n* Dartmouth University (RD)\\n* University of California Santa Barbara (RD)\\n* University of California Irvine (RD)\\n* Case Western Reserve University (BSMD)\\n\\n*Rejections:*\\n\\n* University of Chicago (EA, this one hurt :( i really liked my uchicago essay)\\n* Johns Hopkins University (RD, used to be my dream school so also hurts)\\n* Northwestern University (RD)\\n* Rice University (RD)\\n* University of Southern California (RD)\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\nin my additional info, i just detailed the different research initiative i was involved in and put an abstract of my ib extended essay on immunotherapy and melanoma!\\n\\nik it must sound so pretentious to say that blah i was insanely insecure initially about not getting into a college, but i'm completely serious. perhaps it's bc i didn't follow the same robotics + speech and debate + leadership route that all of my peers did and perhaps i simply lack lots of self confidence and have a terrible habit of undermining my accomplishments and comparing myself to others (sadly, a linkedin stalker :( but working on it!). i had two pretty major mental breakdowns summer before senior year and went into a deep bout of depression (esp when i got sucked into the often unhealthy cycle of reddit -- like don't get me wrong y'all are great but to a stressed junior w no self esteem? nope)\\n\\nand so when making my college list, i didn't apply to most of the ivys and t20s bc i didn't feel like i would get in. i loaded up on safeties bc i was terrified of not getting in anywhere. in hindsight, i do kinda wish i could see how i stack up to some of the other ivys i didn't apply to and i, overall, wish i applied to less schools and spent more time on supplementals for each college.\\n\\nbut i think the one school i def didn't regret applying to was upitt bc it was my first application (in like early oct) and i got my results (acceptance!!) in 3 days and it was a *massive* confidence booster like my parents and i literally cried tears of joy when i got it because *oh my gosh i'm got into a college*. for any juniors reading, highly recommend applying to a safety rolling school first!\\n\\nbut yeah! i think that to any rising seniors who are reading and feel intimidated by all the amazing ppl in college results -- remember that you've got a whole lot more activities and accomplishments than you think!! have faith in your application and i wish y'all the best of luck! and to my rising college freshman, i hope you have the most amazing experience in the college you end up at and wishing y'all the best of luck too!\", 'Southern Girl in STEM Narrowly Escapes Waitlist Hell **Demographics**\\n\\n* Gender: Female\\n* Race/Ethnicity: White\\n* Residence: NC\\n* Income Bracket: Upper Middle\\n* Type of School: Low-Ranked Semi-Competitive Private (feeder only to our state flagship)\\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): Woman in STEM...?\\n\\n**Intended Major(s)**: Applied as a chem major, but I\\'m still mostly undecided and want to pursue majors/minors in both the humanities and STEM\\n\\n**Academics**\\n\\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.85 UW (lots of A- and B+ grades; one B lol). 4.35 W.\\n* Rank (or percentile): HS designates top 20 GPAs in our class of 120; I did not make it oof\\n* \\\\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 10 Honors / 9 AP / 1 \"post-AP\" (multivariable calc; weighted as an AP in GPA)\\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP English Lit, AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP Psychology, Honors Multivariable Calculus, 2 semester-long standard-level themed English classes\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*\\n\\n* SAT I: 1540 (790RW, 750M, 20/24 essay) (did not submit bc of harsh curve)\\n* ACT: 36C (36E, 35M, 36R, 36S, 10/12 essay)\\n* SAT II: cancelled and didn\\'t take lol\\n* AP: World History (4), Lang/Calc BC/Chem/US History (5)\\n* Other (ex.

In the end, it was a very good thing for me, since I was pushed to find other summer activities and ended up doing a lot of interdisciplinary STEM/humanities stuff (my writing internship as well as the Science, Technology, and Society and Cognitive Science summer camps). That summer\\'s activities helped me figure out that I didn\\'t want to be a hard STEM major and that I wanted to incorporate my love of the humanities into my academic and professional careers.

She also saw me grow a lot in math, as I didn\\'t get my first solid A average until my second junior year semester. I also participated in the Cog Sci camp with her, so she probably had a lot of personal experiences to talk about in the letter.\\n\\n*APUSH Teacher: 9/10*\\n\\n* We were basically best friends. I had him for Gov as a sophomore and APUSH as a junior, and I know he noticed I genuinely loved history. I regularly stopped by to talk outside of class, and I put in an absurd amount of effort into classwork and projects. I also made a poster referencing one of our class\\' inside jokes that he laminated and stuck on the wall. It is my legacy. Side note: I asked for this rec letter late because MIT required a letter from a non-STEM teacher, and I ended up submitting it to all of my schools. The teacher in question stopped grading current students\\' tests to write my LOC because it \"sounded more fun\" lmao\\n\\n*Chem Teacher: ??/10*\\n\\n* I had this teacher for Honors Chem as a sophomore and AP Chem as a junior. He was very hard to read and covered 99% of his emotions with sarcasm, but i THINK he liked me. Our AP Chem class was kind of wild, and I was one of the few students not constantly creating a ruckus. I dropped a few beakers, never had higher than an A- average, and made a B- on a semester exam, but I was the only student in the class looking to study chemistry after high school and that didn\\'t actively hate the subject. But I seriously can\\'t imagine what he could\\'ve written in the LOC because he was so stoic.\\n\\n*Writing Internship Boss: 6/10*\\n\\n* I don\\'t think she had ever written a LOC, so she might not have stuck to the most \\\\~effective\\\\~ template. She did send me a post-internship write up separate from the LOC that praised my work ethic and writing skill, though.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\n*MIT: i don\\'t even know man/10*\\n\\n* This was my first interview, and I got an interviewer who was young and quite similar to me. That resulted in me kind of treating her as a therapist and I unloaded a LOT of funky trauma onto her. We had gone through a lot of the same problems growing up in the conservative South, so we bonded a lot but it definitely wasn\\'t a traditional interview. 1/2 of the interview was spent actually talking about MIT. Also we had the same breed of dog. Definitely a hot mess of an interview, but I really want to be friends with her now.\\n\\n*Penn: 8/10*\\n\\n* Relatively standard but good. I had another Southern female interviewer with the same childhood difficulties as me, but I was PREPARED this time and didn\\'t treat her like a best friend/therapist. We had a lot to talk about, both because of our similarities and because I had spent time on the Penn campus and knew a lot about the school.\\n\\n*Northwestern: 6/10*\\n\\n* Interview started with me being very anxious, but I had an extremely sweet interviewer who made sure I was comfortable. The interview was nothing special, but I managed to get out the reasons I\\'d be a good fit for Northwestern and connect personally with my interviewer.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\n*Personal Statement: 6.5/10*\\n\\n* Technically well-written, but semi-cliched. I wrote about cheerleading as well as my logical, independent approach to problem solving and how I learned to be more \\\\~collaborative\\\\~ through my sport. Boring, but very polished since I worked on it all summer.\\n\\n*Supps for Early Rounds: 4/10, 5/10, 9/10*\\n\\n* My MIT supplementals were BAD. That\\'s it. I definitely came off as entitled. Never thinking about those essays again.\\n* I applied early to my state school and early in the rolling process to my safety. None of these essays were particularly brilliant, but they got the job done.\\n* I was and am quite proud of my UChicago essays. I had written multiple \"quirky\" UChi essays in prior years for classes and for fun, so even though the one I submitted was written and edited over the course of maybe four hours over two nights, I\\'d had practice. Definitely a solid \"Why UChicago\" essay too. I also submitted a video profile for UChicago where I baked croissants and talked about my \\\\~growth mindset\\\\~.\\n\\n*Supps for RD: 8/10*\\n\\n* I mostly copied the early supplementals that I had written for my safety school, my state school, and MIT. I wrote every \"Why School\" essay originally, though, to avoid being repetitive and bland. I was proudest of my \"Why Northwestern\" essay that I framed through my walk through the campus I did.\\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\\n\\n*Acceptances:*\\n\\n* UNC Early Action (Accepted into the Honors College and into the Accelerated Research Program)\\n* Pitt Rolling (Accepted into the Honors College, 20K/yr scholarship)\\n* UChicago!! Deferred EA, Accepted EDII\\n\\n*Deferrals:*\\n\\n* MIT\\n\\n*Withdrawn:*\\n\\n* BU\\n* CMU\\n* Columbia\\n* Harvard\\n* JHU\\n* Lehigh\\n* NEU\\n* Northwestern\\n* Penn\\n* WashU\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n*Weaknesses:*\\n\\n* Low STEM grades as a STEM applicant. Most of my below-A grades were in math and science. My school is quite tough, though, so it wasn\\'t *that* bad.\\n* Contrived essays (mainly for MIT/early schools/non-\"Why School\" essays). I think part of my success with UChicago was because I didn\\'t  submit those typical leadership/community/etc prompts.\\n* Largely underwhelming ECs. No national competitions or Ivy League internships. You get the picture.\\n\\n*Strengths:*\\n\\n* Stats. These definitely helped me at my state school and safety school with Honors Colleges/scholarships.\\n* Interdisciplinary profile (for UChicago specifically). I know they look for students who want to study many subjects across the academic board, so my ECs and classes that focused on both humanities and STEM were probably appealing.\\n* Women in STEM maybe??? I don\\'t know if that\\'s so much of a hook, but I had multiple ECs that strengthen the point.\\n\\n*Final Thoughts:*\\n\\nI couldn\\'t be happier with my decision to switch from the RD to the EDII pool after being deferred EA from UChicago. I don\\'t think I would\\'ve been accepted without the ED bump, so even though I wasn\\'t 100% confident in my decision then, I would choose it again in a heartbeat. I think I\\'m a great fit for the school, so I\\'m glad my application profile ended up showing that.\\n\\nLooking back, I\\'m surprised that my frankly mediocre ECs landed me a spot at a \\\\~T10\\\\~. Combined with my lack of awards or 4.0 GPA, my acceptance seems like a miracle to me. At my school, I\\'ve seen students who are honestly much smarter than me get waitlisted and denied at top schools they would flourish at. Originally, I felt competitive about college applications. I wanted to go to the best college out of my class to \"prove\" my worth to my peers. Looking back, I was an idiot. I couldn\\'t be more grateful for my acceptance, but hearing about rejections and waitlists handed to equally and more competitive applicants that I know is painful. I don\\'t believe anyone \"deserves\" a spot at any university, but some of these rejections and waitlists truly don\\'t reflect the amazing strength of the applicants. This year was brutal. If I hadn\\'t switched into the EDII pool, I don\\'t think I\\'d have been spared either.\\n\\nOn that depressing note, I\\'ll end this post.

That being said, I had as good a relationship with her as possible, I went outta my way to ask for a few extra meetings to discuss my ECs, application strategy and stuff and she was quite impressed. This could very easily have been super generic tho lol.\\n\\nChemistry (10/10) – She’s my favorite teacher ever, had her since 10th grade, and for her my doing well in her class was essentially a prerequisite. I worked with her on the D&T Lab and she really saw me come out as a leader there, especially when we pitched the idea together to the principal and directors of school. She also knew all about my medical issues (see later), and called my mom after any procedure I had to check up on me. Plus, she’s been head of the chem and bio dept at our school for over a decade and knows how to write lors well (I hope!).\\n\\nEnglish (8/10) – She taught me in 11th and 12th. I worked with her closely as editor of the school magazine and she was my class teacher in 12th, I was always decent at English never anything so special, but she knew I’m a good writer and had seen me work well in teams and stuff. We discussed my physics blogs in class quite a bit too. I honestly wasn’t sure about getting this rec before a parent teacher meeting we had in October where she said some really really nice stuff about me.\\n\\nJNU Prof (9/10) – He got to know me really well over the 2 years I worked with him. He made me read college level physics and solid-state matter textbooks and quizzed me on what I’d read before allowing me to work with him. I also worked really long hours at the lab, coming whenever I possibly could and he noticed that too. He let me read the letter after I’d submitted it and I think it was pretty good, he spoke a lot about how I thrive in academic environments. Idk how important external LORs even are though.\\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\nTo preface this – UK interviews are VERY different from US, in UK the interview is the final, compulsory step in your application, if a uni takes interviews, you can’t get in without one. Rather than talking to an alum ur interviewed by professors in your department and the interviews are known to be hella intense (especially oxbridge, where it’s usually a 3V1 situation)\\n\\nImperial – Super Intense. Started with a few basic questions on my personal statement and why I wanna study MSE. Then she asked me a completely random technical question on how I’d design a hydrogen containment unit and how I’d store hydrogeen we spent like 15 mins on this, grilled me a little and questioned deeper but all-in-all I enjoyed the conversation and I thought she was happy with my answers too. She then asked me about my favorite material and what holds it back in industry and everyday applications. In the end I asked her about F1 at Imperial and we vibed a little on F1, she actually worked with F1 teams on their cars and I was j like damnnn.\\n\\nOxford – I had 2 interviews, one at Mansfield and one at Teddy Hall. These were even more intense than Imperial lol, went straight to the technical Qs. I’d been preparing for my Oxford Interviews for the past 2 years tho so I didn’t completely break down lol. There were only 2 questions in the first interview, one on reciprocal lattices and one on carbon fibre, we spent 15 minutes on each. Second interview had 3 questions, too much to explain rn, pm me if you wanna know! All-in-all I think I did the best I could and honestly thought they went pretty well (but the thing with Oxford is that you can never know how an interview went, there’s no correct answer, they want to see how you approach an unseen problem).\\n\\nColumbia – Pretty good, my interviewer was damn chill and it was a nice conversation. I was able to answer most questions pretty well (acc to me). Got tripped up on, “How does Columbia connect to your future goals?” because I don’t really know what my goals are (crying emoji). He seemed to really like Columbia but didn’t really say any extraordinary shit like I hope you get in, just wished me luck for the rest of my apps at the end. So basically good, but nothing special.\\n\\nPrinceton – Again, pretty good. I answered everything well and really showed my personality, he said he “enjoyed talking with me.” We talked about my blog, bike maintenance, MUN, and a lot about Princeton. He was done with his questions pretty quick tho so we just talked about random stuff for 15 mins, we totally nerded out on our mutual love for Pokemon!\\n\\nBerkeley SEED Scholars Program – Really good, it was with the program director and one current SEED Scholar. They pretty much had a pre-decided set of questions which they asked me. I really focused on how I’m an intl student so that gives me a wide world-view and honestly just regurgitated all of my essays to answer questions on teamwork and failure and stuff.\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\\n\\nFor context to the commonapp – I’ve been suffering from an L4 L5 Disk herniation for the past 2 years. While I wasn’t bed-ridden, every step I took was accompanied by pain, my posture was crooked in every photo around that time. I had 2 procedures which had no impact on my situation (epidural blocks – where they inject steroids into the back to relieve pain), months and months of physio, painkillers. etc. I had a microdiscectomy surgery in July 2021 and only after that did I see improvement. I’m almost back to normal now and am starting sports again but the entire journey was a truly transformative one.\\n\\nCommonapp - I spent a LOT of time on my essays, started my commonapp in July. It was really personal and vulnerable. It was about my struggles with my back, basically about how I’ve broken binaries all my life (being a 17-year-old with back issues and a guy who likes to cook). My parents said they were crying after they read it (but when are parents ever objective lol).\\n\\nSupps – Honestly, I enjoyed writing supplements much more than my commonapp. Tied my interest in material science to my activities and how material science (like me) breaks binaries of Physics and Chemistry. Had a fair bit of quirky essays too, one was about the mathematical shape of pringles and one was about broomstick aerodynamics in Harry potter. Had a lot of essays about my experience of tackling gender gaps while setting up my schools D&T Lab and trying to bring about equity in Kashmiri patriarchal traditions. I also made a pest out of myself to find random interesting resources at the college (I found a class on material science of sports at georgiatech which is linked to their phenomenal aquatics center, talked about a matsci class on Japanese companies at Stanford and how I love anime, and pokemon, my entire why Columbia essay was a metaphor with me driving through their underground tunnel system in an F1 car I made at their maker lab, found a summer program specifically about nano-sensors at Penn).\\n\\nUK SOP (10/10) – I can rate this one because it’s so straightforward lol, talked about my interest in materials, my research, blog, books I’ve read. I had my research mentor read it and he was really impressed with the technical depth at which I spoke about topics in materials. Even my why major supps were similar to this.\\n\\nI also did have one of those “admissions specialists” read through my essays, but that was mainly for red flags and stuff, nothing to special (see? She would have caught this lmao).\\n\\n**Decisions**\\n\\n**Putting spoilers cuz I always enjoyed predicting (and getting them all wrong – fuck the uncertainty in this process).**\\n\\n**USA**\\n\\n*Georgiatech MSE (EA2) 70.3% Accepted –* >!Accepted!<\\n\\n*UMich MSE (EA) 56.8% Accepted –* >!Deferred ->Waitlisted!<\\n\\n*UIUC ME (EA) 74.4 % Accepted –* >!Accepted!<\\n\\n*Yale ME (REA) 43.6% Deferred –*>!

Stanford waitlist (mainly due to location)!<*. I think I had a fairly decent spike in Mechanical Engg/ Material Science along with a few other activities I enjoyed. I also managed to connect all my essays to my family background and culture which I think is really important. And honestly, while I didn’t have any “crazy” accomplishments like intl awards and Olympiads, I think the subjective parts of my application got me into* >!Princeton (!<*essays, LORs).*\\n\\n*Also for all the things people say about interviews not mattering, idk if its true. The only high-reach school I got into was one where I interviewed, so…*\\n\\n*Also wanted to take this opportunity to tell people NOT to shotgun. Since I was applying to UK Colleges where the process is fairly straightforward, I had a decent safety. In the USA I carefully created my college list and even didn’t apply to MIT because the app was too long and I wanted to focus on other reaches (like*>! Princeton!!!<*). I gave up on duke, CMU, and northwestern after getting into* >!Imperial!< *in Dec. Quality>>>Quantity (atleast in my opinion, I was lucky enough to not need aid).*\\n\\n*I also just wanted to say that the process has a way of getting you where you are meant to be. Since 11th, my dream school was* >!Oxford, I!< *got rejected but got into* >!Princeton!<*, arguably the Oxford of the USA (old colonial vibes, academic focus, small community). So wherever you go, you WILL thrive. Just remember, it doesn’t matter where you go for college, what matters is what you make out of your experience, hell I’m probably gonna be depressed and fail at Princeton lol .*']\n"

I personally find it so weird and alarming when grown adults will do anything in their power to defend and protect a self diagnosing minor(s) from being outed for being a faker. They're always the same type of adults too - that have numerous \"quirky\" mental illnesses (self diagnosed of course) in their bios or have made 12 videos about it. I saw some comments last night on a TikTok where kids were openly admitting to being self diagnosed with DID and a grown person, who happens to be the creator of the post, was supporting them. When people would come out and expose the fact that the kids are lying, the creator would throw insults and get creepily defensive over the kids who are clear as day lying. The creator had claimed they know nothing about DID and don't have it yet shamed anyone who did know about DID and would attempt to educate the creator which would cause the creator to delete peoples comments in an attempt to not let these self diagnosing minors who are lying see the reality of the disorder they're faking. I don't understand why some grown adults refuse to acknowledge this type of faking behavior and stop supporting it all together. What do they get from this? The approval of little kids online? It's weird how this creator (who claims to be 25) strived for the approval and attention  from little 13+ years olds who are lying about having a rare disorder while supporting their delusional behavior. \n",

      "Life with anxiety is becoming unbearable Hi everybody! This past few years were definitely the hardest on me. Ever since I turned 20 (now 24) I have only been confronted with situations that made my anxiety spiral. I try to challenge myself in life but by trying new things I actually just end up giving up on it beause it puts a terrible strain on me. For example wanting to do volontary work abroad, university studies, trying a new workplace or I tried to own a pet twice now but due to terrible anxious reactions I had to give them back after a few days. My anxiety manifests by having terrible stomach pain that makes me vomit and prevents me from sleeping days on end, it continues with panic attacks, diarrhea, weight loss and so on. Everytime I start to challenge myself I have to cancel that experience in order to lessen my anxiety again, but at the same time I miss on so many opportunities I desperately want to achieve. This pain is really becoming unbearable and I feel like I am putting a big strain on my family. Especially due to this recent event of adopting a kitten and now being able to take care of it because my overthinking is turning me incredibly sick. I am aware that the act is terrible and I have put my family through unnecessary pain. I feel like a monster that is a huge burden to others and it‘s really getting worse as time goes on. I am in psychotherapy, have visited psychiatrists before and have been prescribed xanax. I am feeling like a failure and really need some guidance on how to handle this.\n",

Between 3 jobs, 19 credits, honors research preparation and graduate school preparation, I am stretched thin. Beyond thin! I woke up late for my Research Methods lecture today and his attendance policy is quite frankly, and pardon my language, fucking stupid. The professor deducts 5% for arriving late even by a single minute. However, attendance is not mandatory. It’s better to skip than to receive a deduction to my grade for being late this one time. I don’t know about anyone else but going from an A to an A- because I came in a few minutes late isn’t appealing to me at all?? \n",

I’m about to start my junior year of college in August, and I have no idea what I want to do with my life :( Freshman year I chose Pre-Nursing as my major, and I instantly knew nursing wasn’t for me. I then chose Social Work as a major because I want to help people, but then I realized how overwhelmed and underpaid Social Workers are so i’m thinking of changing it once again. I’ve been thinking of majoring in psychology and getting my master’s in mental health counseling, but i feel like me having some mental health issues makes my nervous to learn about the field. It’s so frustrating because i’m scared to fail. I’m currently on a 4 semester scholarship so I don’t want to waste money by pursuing one major and switching to another.

I was devastated when I was rejected by NEU; I thought my life was over and that I would have to attend my safeties, which I ended up LOVING and would prefer over NEU haha.* \n",

This is the trajectory of a medical fad. DID was based on poorly conceived theories and used potentially damaging treatment methods. The problem continues, given that the DSM-5 includes DID and accords dissociative disorders a separate chapter in its manual.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Diagnosis” implies *certainty*; doctors only make a diagnosis when they are *reasonably* *certain* of the situation. But if you’re evaluating yourself, you cannot ever be *reasonably* certain, as self-bias is unavoidable (professionals can’t even treat their friends and family because that’d be a conflict of interest). You can say you *suspect* you have something because “suspect” means you are open to the opinion of the professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to psychology and neurology, self-diagnosis is *never* okay. Not even for the “simpler” diagnoses like depression or anxiety. Simple physical ailments can be okay to self-diagnose as the evidence is more tangible, but psychology can be so intangible and convoluted that you can very easily be steered wrong. Think about it; how can you tell *for* *sure* if what you have is clinical depression or a bout of sadness? An anxiety disorder or an abnormal amount of stress? AVPD or apprehension towards social situations? You have no baseline to compare your experience to! \n",
      "“But what about DSM-5 criteria?” You can stare at the criteria all you want—you’ll never be able to overcome self-bias. It’s disturbingly easy to see yourself in the criteria. You’d need to have someone else who can view your situation though an objective lens and analyze it with the DSM-5. The DSM is helpful and informative, but it omits a lot of the nuance around the disorders that professionals can keep in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you defend self-diagnosis because you believe that professionals are misguided and cold-hearted, you should stop relying on the DSM-5 to evaluate yourself. Because guess who’s responsible for it? And while we’re at it, guess who’s responsible for all the research on the very same disorders you believe you have?\n",
      "\n",
      "Another defense of self-diagnosis is that you know your mind better than the professionals. And that’s half-true; you know your personality and habits better than anyone, and that’s why therapy sessions are spent asking and answering questions like in an interview. Professionals know much more about how minds work *in* *general*. You might know what your personality and habits are, but professionals know more about what might be happening behind the scenes that explains them.\n",

No matter how the internet can make it look, self-diagnosis is still unpopular in the grand scheme of things, especially among older adults and professionals.

      "But while this whole mental illness awareness growth has definitely been positive, it has been just as negative too. \n",
      "\n",
      "It first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don't need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it's easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing \"depressed\" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today's teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren't. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids. There was a lot of discourse on Schizophrenia and Psychosis as well at the time, a lot of people pretending to experience hallucinations and voices. I think this was because it was deemed as the worst mental illness there is, so people caught on to that. Other disorders I forgot to mention were OCD and PTSD. Schizophrenia, OCD and PTSD were probably the most prevalent back in time. I'm not exactly sure why OCD got popular, I remember VERY briefly there being a movie with a character that had OCD, but that's as far as my memory goes and I'd appreciate elaboration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's important to establish that with every single era thus by far and with the one to come, most fakers were young teens most frequently aged from 12 to 16. And with every single one, the generation of it caught on and always believed to be sick with whatever was trending. I myself was sadly a victim to the Tumblr era, a bit ahead of my time even, but it's not Friday so maybe storytime for another day. Anyways, this whole concept of the faker being mentally ill was present throughout ALL of these eras, man, people were this insecure of their faking. And I'm sure by now you have already noticed a pattern, almost every era there is most of the younger teens caugh on to it and self diagnosed themselves with whatever it is that people deemed as \"damaged\". But to establish what I mean even further, let me get to today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, generating from the evil of all, Tik Tok, most popular disorders to fake are practically all disorders. But mainly DID, Autism, ADHD, BPD, Tourettes and Psychosis. It's actually interesting to even see that autism is in this at all as it is not exactly a mental illness as much as it is a neurological disorder, you're born with it, it's not developed from trauma... \n",
      "But anyway, at this point every second cis girl (but probably doesn't identify as that) you talk to chances are she's gonna be a self diagnosed something from one of these, or all. And it's actually so wide spread that it's unavoidable, every single fandom I am in, no matter how niche or old, has several of those fuckers in every possible platform I've tried. Each year we stray further and further from our uniqueness as human beings and shove ourselves down pitholes of labels more and more. It's incredibly depressing, and it's a formula for a huge disaster. In fact, mentioning the word 'depressing' just now, it's no longer quirky to have Depression, in fact online you'd be looked down on it for because you don't have a mental illness that implies that you've went through buttloads of (supposed) trauma. Nowadays you don't even have to say that, just say that you have a disorder that's developed from lots of trauma and it's kind of just assumed that you're living a \"hellish life\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Now back to the title of the post. See, most teens nowadays have tik tok, and this whole disorder phenomenon is so wide spread that practically anyone can find out about it at any time, whether that is from tik tok videos, from meeting someone that supposedly has those disorders or from simply communicating in fandoms that they're in. It's just so widespread that most teens online are bound to find out about it. Teens, being gullible and easly influenced immediately believe those people trying to convince them that they have a serious mental illness by making basic things sound serious (such as daydreaming) and there we go, we have another self diagnosed DID System. \n",
      "You're not faking because you have some kind of deep reason or mental illness that's causing you to be an attention seeker. You're faking because it's simply what everyone around you is doing, it's what's deemed acceptable by the other people your age, it's what they have convinced you makes you valid and seen. \n",
      "That does not mean that all fakers have no trauma or no mental illness, but chances are that they aren't the reason they're faking. \n",
      "And that's honestly not even those teens' faults. I'm sure most people in this server were either fakers at some point, or have diagnosed mental illness and it hurts them to see others online fake their daily horror as something for attention on tik tok. But whichever you are, it's important to establish one thing: self diagnosis is not a valid way of diagnosing yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "These people are never going to go through the actual joy of finally getting a psychologist to diagnose you for all these things you've been struggling with for years. But here's the difference between medically diagnosed and self diagnosed;\n",
      "Being medically diagnosed allows you to understand what you're going through and get actual help for it. Help through therapy that is proven to be beneficial, there's actually very few mental illness that cannot be \"fixed\". The point is to fix your issues and live life normally, not letting your past haunt you. \n",
      "But all self diagnosis does is enabling you to wear your disorder as a \"thropy\" as it is the case for many of these people. Wearing their supposed trauma and issues as a trophy to show to the world instead of getting help for them. KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY STEP TO FIXING THAT PROBLEM. No one can cure their mental illness on their own or through online relationships, it's not that simple. Knowing that you have a mental illness is not the same as fixing it, nor does it enable you to be able to fix it, and what's the point in knowing that you're a DID system if you're not going to take the time to become apart of those \"singlet\" people that you love insulting so much? \n",

      "faking illness isn't always a sign of mental illness in itself This whole \"a person faking mental illness is a sign of mental illness, even if not the one they're faking\" discourse is mainly a discourse created by insecure teenage girls that know what they're doing and still want to feel validated for it. \n",
      "Let me elaborate, usually the whole argument is that a person who wants to be sick with a mental illness is someone who's probably deprived of attention and care, someone who desires sickness and bad things for themselves. Therefore, they are individuals with huge self image issues from (usually) some kind of emotional neglect. \n",
      "Of course, it can be explained this way, and this might be the case for some of them, but this is simply untrue. \n",
      "\n",
      "See, over the last about 10 years (at least to my knowledge) mental illness awareness has been raising rapidly on the internet with a lot more resources and attention to mental disorders than ever before. Hell, just a few years ago DID still had the name of Multiple Personality Disorder which is simply a HUGE misconception of the disorder and just recently they started understanding it better. \n",

      "\n",
      "It first started out with people faking Depression and Anxiety, more specifically on Tumblr. To be honest you don't need a mental health professional to tell you that you have Depression, but hey that means it's easier to fake. Back then it used to be teens highly romanticizing \"depressed\" movie characters as well as using Depression and Anxiety as means to glamorize trauma and coping mechanisms. Was it really all that harmful? Well, just like today's teens it caused a lot of people to believe they are sick when they simply weren't. Actually, I recommend a video by  YouTuber oliSUNvia on this topic for even more insight https://youtu.be/qCKH5fUvsPI she basically talks about how she used to believe that she was Depressed and having Anxiety attacks because of Tumblr when in reality, she was just influenced to believe that. \n",

      "Then we move on to more recent years, say about 4 years ago? I remember there was a spike on self diagnosing Depression and Anxiety again, mostly with Gacha kids.

      "diagnosing factitious disorder I’ll start this post by saying I lurk in this sub way too frequently….both out of interest and sheer horror. I’m an undergrad psych student who’s interested in pursuing a career in therapy, and seeing how prevalent it’s become for teens / young adults to essentially put on an elaborate façade that they’re struggling with a dissociative disorder is concerning to say the least. I’m just wondering how a mental health professional would address a client behaving like this? There’s obviously some form of mental turbulence underlying these people’s desire to fake having d.i.d (whether it be attention seeking or lacking a sense of identity) but how would a counselor attempt to convince them that’s not the disorder they actually have? We’ve discussed the concept of “reactance” in my counseling classes, which makes me concerned that they would essentially double down on their unfounded belief of having d.i.d when confronted that they’ve been faking. Do you guys have any thoughts / ideas about this? Thanks!!:)\n",

      "I blame the increase of disorder fakers on Social Media Before I start rambling, I want to preface the following by saying I usually don't make statements as to whether or not people are faking disorders/illnesses (unless it's REALLY obvious), especially with autism seeing as it's a spectrum. But in some cases that's where the problem starts, the fact that because it's a spectrum or that the disorder is still not completely understood, it leaves the so called 'aesthetic' parts of the disorder open for serious exploitation, which is made infinitely easier through social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's easier to believe your own lies when you have affirmation from others. And of course, most people are usually sympathetic when it comes to mental illnesses/disorders/disabilities, so there will always be people to validate them (often the fakers themselves). This results in a vicious circle of lies believed to be truth because of the constant affirmation through tik tok/twitter/tumblr comments sections. Then it no longer becomes a lie, it becomes a phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are those who will 'play up' certain symptoms for 'validation' until they fully believe it's a disorder. For eg) Getting goosebumps at a certain part of a song, then doing a little happy dance thinking it's a stim. Then get further influenced by researching ADHD/Autism etc, now they're buying fidget toys and thinking their favorite singer/movie/tv show is a hyper-fixation of sorts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I understand the last part is actually how a lot of people discovered they were on the spectrum but there's a difference between discovering small behaviors over the years that (with proper research) turned out to be autism, and taking a particular behavior and exaggerating it to seem similar to the symptoms after research.These people are easier to spot because they usually tend to mimic the lower part of the spectrum despite being visibly a functional person. Obviously because it's more convincing to make an overt display of the lower spectrum symptoms rather than the more discreet symptoms which doesn't really come across much when they're recording themselves on Tik Tok.\n",

      "All of this being said, I do appreciate those who do genuinely try to educate people on ALL aspects of mental illness and not just the parts that 'look good'. I'm probably saying what everyone has already said but I really had to put it in words for myself. It is annoying knowing that these people will eventually grow out of this phase while the damage to the credibility of mental illness has already been done to those who can't call it a phase. It puts everyone in a difficult situation especially now that people are trying to justify self-diagnosis. In VERY FEW cases, I can understand where it's necessary but I still disagree that it's a valid method.If you disagree or agree, please let me know your side.

      "My Wife Attempted Suicide Wednesday afternoon my wife took a massive amount of medication. She texted me a photo of two piles of pills and said \"Goodbye. I'm sorry.\" I was at my parents apartment in the same building as ours, so I ran to our apartment, but she locked me out. I beat on the door over and over yelling for her to open up, and when she finally did, she just stumbled across the floor and fell on her bed, gagging and crying. I called 911 and held her head up and tried to keep her awake. She was vomiting everywhere. The paramedics carried her out of the apartment and down to a stretcher and I sped to the ER right behind them. They gave me a number to call in the ER to get updates, and all they kept saying was that she was in very critical condition and they're doing their best to stabilize her. She was vomiting so much that they couldn't pump her stomach and had to put her on a ventilator. Hours went by that felt like days, and the Dr finally called and said that they stabilized her, she was on a ventilator, but with the amount of duloxetine she ingested there was a high chance that she'd either be \"brain dead\" or have brain damage. I fell apart. My dad was there to hold me up, but I felt all the wind leave my lungs. My dad took the phone and talked to the Dr some more and then he picked me up like I was a kid and got me out of there and into the car. He said there's nothing we can do here. She's in ICU, she's gonna pull through, but we're waiting on the CT scan. So he drove us home, I passed out on the couch and at 6am the nurse called to tell us they got her off the ventilator and the scan was negative for brain damage. I threw my clothes on and sped to the hospital and stayed there for 2 days until it was time for her psychological evaluation. They actually said she was of no harm to herself or others and that she didn't require inpatient treatment of any kind. They discharged her to go home. I was speechless. I called her psychiatrist and he was emphatic about her being admitted for psychiatric treatment. She refused and said she just wanted to go home. Now, we have 2 autistic children. I am on short term disability for a migraine that's been going since early May, every day, and I'm not responding to any treatment. My head's a 8/10 on the pain scale nearly every day. I'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow, finally, but I've been at home on bed rest since May 17th with an ice bag on my head. Times are really tough. But now they want her to go home and for me to keep a \"suicide watch\" on her, to keep pills and sharp objects out of her reach. To find her outpatient therapy. To follow up with her psychiatrist and PCP. I can barely make myself a sandwich right now. So we brought her back home and the universe came calling. It was her psychiatrist who she's been seeing for 17 years. He said that if she doesn't follow his medical advice and admit herself to a mental health hospital, then he had no other recourse than to drop her as a patient. At that point, she got up, started getting herself together and said ok find me somewhere to go. I got her admitted to a reputable hospital that her psychiatrist recommended and I haven't heard from her since. I'm lost. I'm stuck between falling apart and angrier than I've ever been in my entire life. And my head is banging...just pounding. I asked my parents to take the kids until this blows over, and all I've been doing is crying, then I stop and get so mad...just furious. Then I break down again. I talked to my therapist and my spiritual advisor and they both helped a lot. But I'm so, so broken. I'm so confused. What did I do to make this happen? I just cry myself to sleep wondering what she's doing and what I'm going to when she comes home. I've never been so scared of something in my life. What if she does this again? What about the kids? They're autistic, they don't understand the complexity of what's going down. What if they find something really wrong with my brain? I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff in the middle of a wind storm, trying to keep my balance, trying to be strong, but knowing that sooner or later I'm going to fall. And everyone is depending on me. And for whatever reason, my wife, my best friend, the mother of my kids, after 14 years together just said \"Goodbye. I'm sorry.\" Where the hell do we even go from here?\n",

      "Tingling sensation due to childhood trauma I have gone through childhood trauma when I was studying in 11th and 12th standard and lived away from my parents at a relatives house. The relatives family members mocked me for my studying habits and demotivated me for studying(academics workload) long hours. They pushed me into believing that I was abnormal and mocked me by saying that- 'highly educated people in their village end up becoming a garbage collector'. They used to say that I ran away from my house( which was infact true) as my step- mom didn't provide me enough food( partly true) and came to their place to eat. They used to make me feel so degraded,and I gradually lost respect for myself, my self worth and my self confidence. Even at the school I went to, the teachers had low standards and didn't recognise my value, which caused me to progressively start doubting myself. \n",
      "On that fateful day, I was studying with books spread out all around me when I suddenly realised that I was struggling to grasp the sentences in the books I was reading. Also no matter how hard I tried to get away, I started to get a sharp, tingling sensation like a needle all over my head. I went down to the room where everyone was watching TV in comfort and attempted to understand what was written in that small book, but I wasn't able to absorb the lines' meanings as well as I used to.\n",
      "The following day when I arrived at the classroom, they were displaying a presentation about pursuing a career in finance, but I was indifferent and started to despise everyone since I was so uncomfortable from a strong tingling feeling that seemed like a needle running across the top of my skull. Due to frequent insults like \"he is a senseless person,\" which came from individuals both at the relatives' home and from instructors and students at school, my personality was completely destroyed.\n",
      "The tingling, needle-like sensation went throughout my entire body, turning me from the once-intelligent, bright youngster into a hollow, dim-witted adult. Even though it has significantly lessened by this point, I am still dealing with that annoying tingling sensation. This is my entire, horrible story, which I deeply regret. Thanks for reading. Any other suggestions for reducing this grating tingling sensation would be greatly appreciated.\n",

      "I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\n",
      "\n",
      "The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\n",

It’s support mental health awareness until someone actually deals with someone who has mental health issues. When the aesthetic doesn’t fit anymore they turn another eye. I reached out to my university for help as someone dealing with suicidal ideation and attempts only to be referred to a homophobic psychologist and labeled as passive aggressive personality disorder. Moreover, when I attempted in my dorm at my university the administrators told me to apologize to the community for simply feeling the way I do. Im sorry whenever I have the slightest emotions it’s not valid but whenever anyone else does there’s room for their emotions but never mine. My therapist doesn’t even give a shit about me and can’t even tell I’ve already died. Every fucking day I wake up constantly helping others and being the light for others yet my light has dimmed out years ago. Therapy just became an agree to disagree session and continually be gaslit by my therapist. The system loves to throw medication to cover up the pain but it’s always there.\n",

The teachers, since are in control, bully the kids who dont stand up for themselves and dont defend themselves,such as asking them why they graded us so low etc. etc. and my self esteem and confidence have been shattered badly. I thought it will be over and i’ll be done with that anxiety, but i’m still extremely anxious, i still get panic attacks thinking about how some teachers treated me, talked to me. which further puts me in a spiral regarding all the relationships that went wrong in my life and i have no idea how to deal with it and fall asleep peacefully at night.\n",

      "I'm torn between college algebra (3 credits) and college algebra and trig (5 credits). I want to take two classes over the summer, intro to financial accounting and a college algebra class. If I take just plain college algebra then I'll be able to take survey to calculus (designed for business courses) and it will fulfill the requirement at my junior college. If I take college algebra and trigonometry, then I'll be able to take calculus 1 which will also fulfill the requirement but is not needed. The reason I'm considering going the college algebra and trigonometry route is that I may or may not need it for my currently undecided major. I guess my question is, will I be commiting academic suicide by attempting a 5 credit math course plus accounting over summer? I can't afford not to work so I'll be working at least 25 to 30 hours over summer. I'm okay in math, I just took a refresher course through Khan academy up through algebra 2.

We do literally all of our work out of the Pearson online book, including tests and quizzes. The professor does not grade anything, design any lessons, or check any work *at all*. She's nice and everything, but completely unnecessary. I have never interacted with her and I imagine that she's just kind of sitting back and watching the grades roll in.

She then asked me about my favorite material and what holds it back in industry and everyday applications. In the end I asked her about F1 at Imperial and we vibed a little on F1, she actually worked with F1 teams on their cars and I was j like damnnn.\n",

There were only 2 questions in the first interview, one on reciprocal lattices and one on carbon fibre, we spent 15 minutes on each. Second interview had 3 questions, too much to explain rn, pm me if you wanna know! All-in-all I think I did the best I could and honestly thought they went pretty well (but the thing with Oxford is that you can never know how an interview went, there’s no correct answer, they want to see how you approach an unseen problem).\n",

      "Commonapp - I spent a LOT of time on my essays, started my commonapp in July. It was really personal and vulnerable. It was about my struggles with my back, basically about how I’ve broken binaries all my life (being a 17-year-old with back issues and a guy who likes to cook). My parents said they were crying after they read it (but when are parents ever objective lol).\n",
      "\n",
      "Supps – Honestly, I enjoyed writing supplements much more than my commonapp. Tied my interest in material science to my activities and how material science (like me) breaks binaries of Physics and Chemistry. Had a fair bit of quirky essays too, one was about the mathematical shape of pringles and one was about broomstick aerodynamics in Harry potter. Had a lot of essays about my experience of tackling gender gaps while setting up my schools D&T Lab and trying to bring about equity in Kashmiri patriarchal traditions. I also made a pest out of myself to find random interesting resources at the college (I found a class on material science of sports at georgiatech which is linked to their phenomenal aquatics center, talked about a matsci class on Japanese companies at Stanford and how I love anime, and pokemon, my entire why Columbia essay was a metaphor with me driving through their underground tunnel system in an F1 car I made at their maker lab, found a summer program specifically about nano-sensors at Penn).\n",
      "\n",
      "UK SOP (10/10) – I can rate this one because it’s so straightforward lol, talked about my interest in materials, my research, blog, books I’ve read. I had my research mentor read it and he was really impressed with the technical depth at which I spoke about topics in materials. Even my why major supps were similar to this.\n",

      "Hi there. I received need some advice. I feel very behind in life my dad passed when I was young due to suicide so I had to stay home and help my siblings then I was sick and had to drop out of school but I got my ged. I’m 22 years old and working a dead end job. I have FAFSA so I’m able to go to college and get a bachelor degree debt free but I have no idea what to persue. I’m very motivated but unsure what direction to put my energy. Things i would really like in a job are great pay, work life balance, remote possibility. Im an INFP personality type and I love creativity though I’m not particularly talented in any areas. I’m not good at math or analytical thinking. I really just need to get something going for myself this year has been really hard and I’m not in a good state of mind. I really need this degree to land me a job bc frankly I can’t afford it not too. I was thinking of just getting into a software development degree since it has good pay and job security but I don’t have passion. Maybe marketing and design also is a bit interesting to me but I don’t think it’s worth it or has a good ROI.  Please any advice I’m pretty desperate at this point.\n",

       "\"Racism Making Me Depressed People probably think I weird for being depressed cause of this.  But, first, I think of Youkrane.  Evil country is invading Youkrane because Youkrane good country that is anti-racism and pro-diversity and pro-human-right.   I depressed because of the suffering of Youkrane.  I ask President of America: please don't stop until Youkrane remove evil invader and make all of Youkrane completely free again.  I will try to stay alive if President don't quit removing evil invader from Youkrane.  I think American President should declare Martial Law and temporarily halt all elections until Youkrane is free and evil invaders are defeated. If evil invaders of Youkrane win, then the Earth will be completely defeated, and then nothing left.  Must win at all cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, so I live in America.  And here, so much racism.  why we have border?  all human is human, right?  so, border exist to oppress people.  why not any human allow to come?  why only one people in country have all the money and power?  why minority people so oppressed and not equally represented in all careers and socio-economic status?  this all make me depressed and suicidal.  all human equal from birth, so all human on earth are automatically citizen of America.  8 billion people on earth, and all are citizens, cause all are equal.  if i have to live in a America that is so racist, then, I can't take the depression and anxiety any more, and I will end my life. If White House declare that all 8 billion people on Earth are citizen of America, then maybe I feel better and try to stay live.\""
