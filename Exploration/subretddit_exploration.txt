NOTE: after I changed date to today a lot of them changed
NOTE: comparison is by date for the comment data (imperfectly) - not for the base data

Questions
When combining sentiment - I normalized all to 0 (score = score - SUM(scores)/len(emotions)) - should I do this?
When combining sentiment over multiple posts I'm dividing by n. Should I do sqrt(n)? Important bc based on when we have data this n can be different 
Should I do some kind of outlier dropping?
