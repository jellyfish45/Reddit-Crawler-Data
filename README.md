# Reddit-Crawler-Data
In this repository, we are going to restore Jupyter notebook regarding the crawling process and the dataset we get to help with future analysis.  
## Creation Timeline 
### (1)scrape_reddit.ipynb: Scraping data with a theme of "suicide" from reddit. And find relevant topics about it.     
### (2)sub_gather.ipynb: Dig deep into the topics and gather the data.   
### (3)posts_influence.ipynb: Try to track the influence of the most influencial submissions to their comment authors (Problem: need to scape more data and use more specific emotion analyzing tool.)    
### (4)sub_analyze.ipynb: Find keywords/valuable Issues related with the topics seperately.   
Other ipynb files are just auxiliary tools.
All the csv documents are the data I collected.
